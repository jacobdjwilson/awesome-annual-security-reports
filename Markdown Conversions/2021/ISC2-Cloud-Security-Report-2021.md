## Introduction

Cloud security concerns remain high as the adoption of public cloud computing continues to surge, especially in the wake of the 2020 COVID crisis and the resulting accelerated shift to remote work environments.

The 2021 Cloud Security Report has been produced by Cybersecurity Insiders to explore how organizations are responding to the evolving security threats in the cloud and the continued shortfall of qualified security staff.

Key survey findings include:

*   Despite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a primary issue for cloud customers. Virtually all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm they are at least moderately concerned about public cloud security, a small increase from last year’s survey.
*   We asked survey participants about the biggest barriers holding back faster cloud adoption. Among the key barriers to cloud adoption, organizations mention lack of qualified staff (39%) as the biggest impediment to faster adoption, followed by data security issues (34%) and legal & regulatory compliance (32%).
*   A majority of organizations (57%) expect their cloud security budget to increase over the next 12 months. On average, organizations allocate 28% of their security budget to cloud security.
*   We asked organizations how they would rate their overall security readiness. A majority of 73% rate their security readiness average or below average. Only half as many say they are above average (27%).
*   As in previous years, the continuing shortage of not only qualified cybersecurity staff but also the lack of security awareness and skills among all employees remains the number one security challenge for organizations. To alleviate this shortage, cybersecurity professionals agree that 6 out of 10 employees would benefit from security training and/or certification for their jobs.

Many thanks to (ISC)2 for supporting this important research project. We hope you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your cloud environments.

Thank you,

## Security in Public Clouds

Despite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a key issue for cloud customers. Virtually all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm they are at least moderately concerned about public cloud security, a small increase from last year’s survey.

Cloud users are particularly concerned with risks arising from misconfiguration of the cloud platform, exfiltration of sensitive data, and unauthorized access (see page 8).

![Chart showing concern levels for public cloud security. 96% of organizations are moderately to extremely concerned.](Image description)

*   96% Of organizations are moderately to extremely concerned about cloud security.
*   Not at all concerned: 1%
*   Slightly concerned: 3%
*   Moderately concerned: 23%
*   Very concerned: 41%
*   Extremely concerned: 32%

## Cloud Security Confidence

The heightened concerns about cloud security have a negative impact on organizations’ confidence in their own cloud security posture. A majority of organizations are at best only moderately confident in their cloud security posture (72% - up from 66% in last year’s survey). While confidence has been declining over time, we still see an alarming degree of overconfidence not supported by the backdrop of security incidents and challenges presented in this report.

The biggest challenges causing loss of confidence in cloud security include concerns around data loss/leakage, data privacy/confidentiality, and accidental exposure of credentials (see page 5).

![Chart showing confidence levels in cloud security posture. 72% of organizations are not at all confident to moderately confident.](Image description)

*   72% Of organizations are not at all confident to moderately confident in their cloud security posture.
*   Not at all confident: 8%
*   Slightly confident: 12%
*   Moderately confident: 52%
*   Very confident: 22%
*   Extremely confident: 6%

## Cloud Security Concerns

While cloud providers offer increasingly robust security measures as part of their cloud services, it is the customer who is ultimately responsible for securing their workloads in the cloud. The most significant cloud security challenges highlighted in our survey are unchanged from last year: data loss/leakage (64% - down five percentage points since last year), data privacy/confidentiality (62% - down four percentage points), and accidental exposure of credentials (46% - up two percentage points).

![Bar chart showing biggest cloud security concerns.](Image description)

## Traditional Tools in the Cloud

Organizations are faced with unique security challenges presented by cloud computing. Unfortunately, most legacy security tools are not designed for the dynamic, distributed, virtual environments of the cloud. Eighty-one percent of organizations say traditional security solutions either don’t work at all in cloud environments or have only limited functionality – a one percentage point improvement from last year’s survey (82%).

![Pie chart showing how well traditional network security tools/appliances work in cloud environments.](Image description)

*   Our traditional network security tools don’t work in the cloud: 81%
*   Limited functionality: 64%
*   All capabilities work in the cloud: 19%
*   17% (This percentage appears to be a typo or incomplete data in the original source, as it's not clearly associated with a category.)

## Drivers of Cloud-Based Security Solutions

Organizations recognize several key drivers for the rapid adoption of cloud computing and the deployment of cloud-based security solutions. Better scalability (55%), faster time to deployment (48%), and cost savings (40%) are the top three drivers. This is followed by reduced efforts around patches and software updates (38%) and better performance (35%).

## Paths to Stronger Cloud Security

When asked about organizations’ responses to changing security needs, the use of native cloud provider security tools (62%) and training and certifying IT staff (61%) rank as the top tactics organizations deploy to assure their evolving security needs are met. This is followed by partnering with an MSSP (33%), hiring staff dedicated to cloud security (31%), and deploying security software from independent vendors (30%).

![Pie chart showing how teams rate their overall security readiness.](Image description)

*   Above average: 27%
*   Average: 57%
*   Below average: 16%

Of those rating their overall security readiness average or below average, 78% believe their teams would benefit from cloud security training and/or certification.

    *   Not sure: 9%

## Security Training and Certification

As in previous years, the continuing shortage of not only qualified cybersecurity staff, but also the lack of security awareness and skills among all employees remains the number one security challenge for organizations. To alleviate this shortage, cybersecurity professionals agree that six out of 10 employees would benefit from security training and/or certification for their jobs.

![Two bar charts showing employee benefit from security training and required certifications.](Image description)

*   **What percentage of your employees would benefit from security training and/or certification for their job?**
