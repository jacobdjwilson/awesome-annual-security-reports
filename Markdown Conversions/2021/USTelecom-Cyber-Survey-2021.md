Small and Medium\-Sized Businesses (SMBs) examines the 
cybersecurity risks, readiness, and realities SMBs who own, operate, or 
support U.S. critical infrastructure face in establishing and maintaining 
cybersecurity in their organizations.The United States critical infrastructure, and thus its national security, 
is dependent on the cybersecurity defensive posture of individual, yet 
highly interconnected, organizations. Because a SMB cybersecurity 
failure can impact the broader digital ecosystem leading to financial 
and reputational loss and service disruption, understanding the 
organizational behavior of companies of various sizes is imperative.The importance of requisite security postures was laid bare during the 
SolarWinds Orion breach when attackers with nation\-state capabilities 
exploited vulnerabilities in the software supply chain of an infrastructure 
management provider. FireEye, the Department of Treasury, and 
the Department of Commerces National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA), among others, were targeted, 
resulting in the Department of Homeland Securitys Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (DHSCISA) issuing an emergency order 
requiring immediate government\-wide action to mitigate the impact of 
the breach.This survey analyzes Critical Infrastructure SMBs whose cybersecurity 
programs often struggle to deliver robust and mature security protocols 
at levels similar to better\-resourced and larger sector enterprises,
leaving them vulnerable to cyberattacks. This unprecedented survey of 
Critical Infrastructure SMBs offers new insights into SMB cybersecurity 
programs and identifies opportunities to address economic, 
operational, and policy gaps.In the midst of an escalated cyberattack environment during the 
COVID\-19 pandemic, this survey provides important insights on how 
SMB cybersecurity practitioners can enhance risk mitigation strategies 
and practices. According to respondents, 50% of Board, CEO, and 
C\-suite executives indicate cybersecurity is a high priority, while only 
26% of employees view cybersecurity similarly. In the accelerated 
remote work environment spurred by the pandemic, closing this priority 
gap is essential to enhancing organization security.USTelecom.orgcybersurvey\|USTELECOM 2021 CYBERSECURITY SURVEY350%of Board CEO, and

mitigate, and respond to cybersecurity risks and to protect the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets under their control. 
Accordingly, an effective cybersecurity program may include, among 
other things: Raising employee awareness and training Performing regular and comprehensive risk assessments Updating policies and procedures Evaluating in\-house capabilities Adopting risk assignment options such as cyber insuranceThe survey questions focus primarily on the business implications 
of cyberattacks and how well SMBs are prepared to defend against, 
respond to, and recover from a variety of harmful incidents.The surveys key findings suggest that breaches, and their impact, 
demonstrate the need for improving awareness, defense, and risk 
management. After a breach, Critical Infrastructure SMBs tend to provide staff withextra training, implement new policies and procedures, change 
configurations, and communicate breaches to customers, thereby 
building trust. A Critical Infrastructure SMBs use of risk assessments andcybersecurity best practices, policies, and procedures typically 
results in the increased use of outsourced cybersecurity providers, 
preparedness, confidence and consumer trust, and the use of 
government guidance. A Critical Infrastructure SMBs use of cybersecurity best practices 
tends to be more robust as annual revenue increases and leads to 
increased levels of transparency and trust with customers, cyber 
prioritization at the board, executive, and directormanager level, use 
of cyber insurance, communications to customers about breaches, 
and confidence in an organizations defense capabilities. Critical Infrastructure SMBs with $11\-20M in annual revenueexperienced the most diverse array of attack types and were the most 
willing to act post\-breach.While improvements made subsequent to an attack are important, 
the survey findings demonstrate the need for proactive cyber risk 
assessments calibrated to the uniqueness of individual enterprises so 
they can best protect against their unique cyber risks. SMB surveys 
like this one, conducted regularly and on a larger scale, will be critical 
to actively monitoring the cyber\-critical infrastructure landscape as it 
evolves.4USTELECOM 2021 CYBERSECURITY SURVEY\|USTelecom.orgcybersurveyBY THE NUMBERS ORGANIZ ATIONAL IMPACT BREACH HISTORYCONSEQUENCES75%of Critical Infrastructure

Enterprise RecommendationsSurvey findings suggest Critical Infrastructure 
SMB enterprises are distinctly vulnerable 
to breaches that can take longer to detect 
and from which to recover. Heightened 
vulnerabilities are evident across the following 
vectors social media; electronically held 
customer information; online bank accounts; 
VPNs; social engineering; and industrial control 
systems. To improve the cyber defensive 
postures of Critical Infrastructure SMBs 
and SMBs more generally, both enterprises 
and policymakers must take deliberate, 
focused, and prioritized action. The following 
recommendations are designed to incentivize 
organizations to be proactive in cyber defense 
efforts and dedicate additional budget toward 
meaningful cybersecurity measures.6RECOMMENDATIONSTOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SMBS Conduct regular cybersecurity training and test staff based on readilyavailable best practices and controls. The training and testing process should 
be regularly evaluated to ensure it addresses the most current threat landscape 
and focuses on what individuals can control (e.g. opening unknown links). Revisit and update policies and procedures annually, or more often ifnecessary. Detailed and documented policies and procedures should identify 
roles and responsibilities and promote organizational accountability. Update system configurations, as recommended by vendors and experts as 
appropriate, and have structured protocols in place to patch vulnerabilities. Conduct annual risk assessments that put cyber risks in empirical andeconomic terms so mitigation techniques can be calibrated to the unique 
risks and risk appetite of the organization, and ensure results are known and 
reviewed by executive management andor boards. Conduct post\-breach assessments and communicate findings to appropriate 
management and departments. Update the policies and protocols to reflect 
risk assessment lessons and insights. Annually evaluate in\-house capabilities and consider retaining outsourced,managed service providers based on a cost\-benefit analysis to augment 
existing cybersecurity staff as needed. Obtain cyber insurance and review policies annually to ensure the appropriate 
coverage and alignment with enterprise risk tolerance in light of operational 
and market changes. Identify and participate in valuable formal and informal informationsharing venues, including sector specific trust pools, that support SMB needs 
and expectations. Establish regular briefings for appropriate levels of management and senior 
executives across all major business units. Implement a process to ensure 
feedback mechanisms to appropriate personnel within the organization. Depending on organization needs and enterprise\-level risk tolerance, most 
organizations should dedicate at least 10\-15% of their IT budget toward 
cybersecurity.These practices will likely require organizations to make additional investments 
in cybersecurity in the context of their overall business plan, which is highly 
encouraged.USTelecom.orgcybersurvey\|USTELECOM 2021 CYBERSECURITY SURVEY7RECOMMENDATIONSPolicymakers RecommendationsBased on survey findings and insights into this unique class of Critical 
Infrastructure SMBs, the following recommendations provide guidance for a 
focused and well\-coordinated national strategy.TOP 4 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICYMAKERS Ensure expectations for SMB cybersecurity are grounded in an 
understanding of economics and appropriate incentives are 
considered.This involves providing firms with prioritization mechanisms and 
guidance on how they should spend limited resources to the 
greatest effect. Resource constrained SMBs need guidance on 
investment maximization.SMBs may not be able to sustain uneconomic investments in 
cybersecurity beyond minimum requirements. Consequently, 
consideration must be given to what incentives may be required. Close the cybersecurity talent gap between Critical InfrastructureSMBs and better\-resourced enterprises.Ideally, cyber talent should be available to companies of all sizes. 
Both government and privately supported programs should be 
implemented to address this gap. Undertake a whole\-of\-nation education effort that begins in K\-12 
and fulfills the expansion of higher education program offerings.In the long\-term, a much broader and strategic approach that seesthe expansion of STEM and cyber\-specific pathways in K\-12 education 
and beyond is necessary. Programs that incentivize students to 
pursue cybersecurity degrees should be expanded. Public\-private 
partnership models can aid in the effort to reduce student debt 
and subsidize the cost of education in this critical career field.1 One 
such example is the National Cyber Education Program (NECP). 
NECP produces cyber curriculum content for K\-12 schools and career 
opportunities, and is supported by public and private sector partners 
including the White House and Discovery Education.28USTELECOM 2021 CYBERSECURITY SURVEY\|USTelecom.orgcybersurveyRECOMMENDATIONSCurrently, only 23 U.S. universities offer undergraduate cybersecurityprograms.3 Efforts should be made to increase the number of 
vocational, undergraduate, and graduate cyber programs.Government agencies should leverage their unique capabilities tocreate educational opportunitiesNSA and DHS have co\-sponsored centers of academic excellence(CAE) programs in cybersecurity operations (CO) and cyber 
defense (CD) in an organized response to increasing cybersecurity 
issues.4\-The Office of Personnel Management launched its Presidential 
Fellows Program and will accept between 300\-600 finalists in 
2021\.5\-The Department of Energy launched its Operational Technology 
(OT) Defender Fellowship program, creating a talent pipeline for 
key U.S. frontline critical infrastructure defenders.6 Distinguish security from compliance and eschew overlyprescriptive or punitive actions.As the U.S. implements the DoDs Cybersecurity Maturity ModelCertification (CMMC) program and other cyber initiatives, the broad 
stakeholder community must ensure that we dont compromise 
security for compliance. We need to focus on cybersecurity as 
opposed to compliance. Government compliance programs could 
waste scarce cyber resources unless they are implemented based 
on cost\-effectiveness measures as opposed to regulatory mandates.By following these recommendations, policymakers can dramatically 
increase the likelihood of effective and sustainable improvements to the 
cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructure SMBs.USTelecom.orgcybersurvey\|USTELECOM 2021 CYBERSECURITY SURVEY9KEY FINDINGS75%of SMBs surveyed 
experienced a 
breach at least 
once in their 
company history,and. . .45%experienced a 
breach within the 
past year1\.Organizational ImpactWe investigated the frequency of SMB cyber breaches (in company 
history, within the past year, and after the onset of the coronavirus 
pandemic), actions taken post\-breach, disruptions to staffs daily work, 
costs to resolve breaches, and how many months companies would 
continue to operate if they experienced a significant breach.Criminals are incentivized to steal data from large and small businesses 
alike. As such, breaches targeting SMBs are increasing in frequency, 
impact, and size. 7According to the Verizon 2020 Data Breach Investigation Report, most 
cyber breaches are web application\- and cloud\-based. The COVID\-19 
pandemic and the consequent mass transition to remote work has 
amplified the problem. Malware and phishing attacks are escalating 
as attackers try to exploit remote workers who operate beyond their 
company network perimeter and may not have adequate security at 
home.Fifty\-three percent of our survey respondents reported an increase 
in phishing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and 37% 
have experienced a cyber breach in the same timeframe. In our 
interviews with executives, it was noted that the expectation for SMBs 
to follow the example of large players and leaders in the industry 
fails to acknowledge vastly different resources and capabilities. The 
organizational impact of cyber breaches on SMBs may require unique 
solutions that recognize this disparity.COMMON EXPERIENCES OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SMBSSMBs that experienced a cyber breach in the past year are significantly 
more likely, across nearly all survey measures, to take actions to repair 
the breach and improve cybersecurity. This trend held true across all 
organization sizes, levels of annual revenue, and critical infrastructure 
sectors. Those who experienced cyber breaches in the past year report: Heightened awareness of vulnerability across the following vectors 
social media, electronically held customer information, online bank 
accounts, VPNs, social engineering, and industrial control systems. Difficulty managing the increasing complexity of cybersecurity,sophistication of attacks, volume of attacks, and struggle to retain 
practitioners to respond to attacks. Higher percentages of annual IT spending directed to cybersecurity(31% average) compared to other organizations (22% average).10USTELECOM 2021 CYBERSECURITY SURVEY\|USTelecom.orgcybersurvey Higher volumes of cyberattacks and, asa result, significantly higher likelihood to 
have cybersecurity insurance, outsource 
cybersecurity, revisit policies and 
procedures, and complete cyber risk 
assessments. Taking actions such as conductingtrainings, communicating breaches 
to customers, changing system 
configurations, and creating new policies 
and procedures.Companies with 50 or fewer employees, 
however, are less likely to take action after 
experiencing a cyberattack. The lack of 
action within organizations of this size may 
stem from a lack of experience, economic 
constraints, limited solution set knowledge, 
and a lack of confidence about defending 
against specific types of attacks.During interviews with executives, it 
was noted that building and delivering 
appropriate education and training to SMBs 
presents opportunities to signal the value 
of investment and an ability to demonstrate 
progress at increasing levels of practitioner 
capabilities.SMBs that experienced a cyber 
breach in the past year are

AND RECOVERYSince no cybersecurity panacea exists, it 
is inevitable that business will sometimes 
be compromised, especially if its a nation\-
state actor engaged in an Advanced 
Persistent Threat. Once an attack is 
successful, the focus shifts from prevention 
to mitigation, which requires a breach 
be detected. Verizon found the number 
of breaches that take months or years to 
discover is greater in large organizations 
than in small organizations. Similarly, 
IBMs 2020 Cost of a Data Breach report 
found that it takes companies, on average, 
about 197 days to identify and 69 days to 
contain a breach.8 Our survey indicates that 
Critical Infrastructure SMBs did not fare as 
well. On average, it took organizations 7\.5 
months to operate following a significant 
breach. To put this figure in context, of the 
4,644 executives surveyed in a 2020 study, 
the longest it took for an organization to 
recover from a breach was 90 days or less, 
with most being able to remediate within 
15 days or less.9 This suggests that SMBsIt takes 7\.5 months for 
organizations to fully recover 
from a breach.59%reported the breach stopped

Fifty\-nine percent reported the breach 
stopped staff from carrying out daily work 
and 46% lost customers. Organizations 
spent $170,000 on average to resolve a 
cyber breach.The chart below shows the cost of

of SMBs, including their confidence defending 
against attacks, use of cybersecurity providers, 
policies and procedures, risk assessments, 
cybersecurity insurance, and use of government 
guidance to make decisions.MEASURING PREPAREDNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF 
CYBERSECURITYPreparedness against cyber breaches is highly 
contextual. Certain behaviors, however, can be 
indicative of cyber breach preparedness, including an 
organizations use of cybersecurity providers, policies 
and procedures, risk assessments, cybersecurity 
insurance, and government guidance to make 
decisions. Although engaging in these preparedness 
activities does not completely eliminate or prevent 
cyber threats, it can increase an organizations 
confidence and ability to respond and recover.Seventy\-two percent of survey participants 
believe their organization is prepared to some 
extent to prevent or recover from a cyberattack. 
However, confidence to defend against attacks 
varied considerably based on organization size. More 
than half of organizations with 50 or less employees 
lacked confidence or were unsure about their ability 
to defend against attacks. Even among the larger 
SMBs, only 617% (depending on size of organization) 
reported being very confident.The chart at right shows the reported confidence 
of SMBs to defend against attacks by number of 
employees.KEY FINDINGS72%of SMBs surveyed believe

calls for all organizations to evaluate their 
in\-house cyber capabilities. Since SMBs in 
many cases have limited budgets and staff, 
finding the properly trained professional 
can be difficult, forcing many to rely on 
service providers to manage their IT and 
cybersecurity needs to keep workflows 
and systems secure. The survey found 
that 52% use an outsourced cybersecurity 
provider. Moreover, companies are more 
likely to outsource cybersecurity if they 
conduct cyber risk assessments. This mayPERCENT OF IT BUDGET

threats that require expert knowledge 
and resources to defend against them. 
In addition, executives shared that the 
scarce talent available in an already tight 
cyber labor market is being absorbed by 
larger organizations. As such, outsourcing 
is becoming the only viable solution to the 
current cyber talent gap for many smaller 
businesses struggling to manage their 
cybersecurity programs. In the short\-term, 
outsourced dependence may be expected 
and welcomed. In the longer\-term, in\-house 
capability may grow in tandem with a 
growing cyber workforce.Appropriately funding a firms cybersecurity 
program can mean the difference between 
a minor incident and a major catastrophe. 
As such, cyber budgets are a top\-of\-mind 
concern for frontline practitioners and 
executives alike. The proportion a business 
invests in cybersecurity relative to its IT 
budget can signal how seriously they view 
the cybersecurity threat and, therefore, how 
prepared they will be to recover in the event 
they are breached. Since cyber budgets 
may consist of, among other things, internal 
staff, consultants, software, hardware, 
trainings, and insurance, it is difficult to 
capture this proportion with any accounting 
precision. With varied consistency in mind, 
the survey found that the average percent 
of IT budget related to cybersecurity across 
all size organizations was 26%. Although 
companies with fewer than 50 employees 
spent a considerably lower percentage of 
their IT budget on cybersecurity compared 
to other groups surveyed, they still spent 
above industry averages, which are in the 
10\-15% range.10Because cyber threats are constantly 
evolving, routinized and annual cyber risk 
assessments help determine whether a 
company is actually prepared to prevent 
or recover from an attack. Fortunately, 74%of survey respondents reported they had 
completed a cyber risk assessment within 
the past 12 months. Reasons for conducting 
risk assessments were influenced by a 
variety of factors, including regulatory 
requirements, coronavirus concerns, 
executive prioritization within companies, 
and experiences with breaches. The survey 
also found that assessing risk improves 
preparedness, confidence, and customer 
trust. Organizations that conducted risk 
assessments assert they are better prepared 
to respond and are confident defending 
against cyberattacks and cyber breaches. 
Organizations conducting risk assessments 
also report higher communication with 
customers resulting in higher customer 
trust. They are also more likely to report: Outsourcing cybersecurity. Experiencing all types of attacks included 
in the survey: phishing, social engineering, 
malware, ransomware, viruses, spyware, 
email frauds, unauthorized use of 
computers from outside the organization, 
unauthorized use of computers from 
someone inside the organization, and 
denial of service attacks. Health, customer, and personallyidentifiable information stolen during a 
cyber breach. Using government programs assistingwith cybersecurity; sharing best practices 
learned from cyberattacks with other 
companies; and participating in trainings 
hosted by the government or private 
organizations.Cybersecurity policies and procedures play 
a significant role in setting behavioral 
norms, especially when employees are 
the weakest links in an enterprise security 
chain. It is, therefore, encouraging that 87% 
of survey respondents reported they have 
cybersecurity policies and procedures in 
place. Cybersecurity policies and procedures 
increase in robustness and breadth ofKEY FINDINGSOrganizations with $50M\+
in revenue use best practices.Organizations with \<$1M in
revenue are more likely to report
using very few best practicescoverage as annual revenue increases. 
Critical infrastructure SMBs with $50M\+ 
in revenue indicated they use and place a 
great deal of importance on nearly all best 
practices assessed in the survey. Conversely, 
organizations with less than $1M in revenue 
are more likely to report placing a lower 
level of importance for a majority of the best 
practices than SMBs with more than $1M in 
revenue. These practices include multi\-factor 
authentication (MFA); training; policies and 
procedures; risk assessments; insurance; and 
software updates. Organizations with policies 
and procedures are more likely to: Take actions resulting from a cyberbreach by conducting extra training, 
communicating with customers, changing 
system configurations, and creating new 
policies and procedures. Report being very confident defendingagainst cyberattacks. Prioritize cybersecurity at the boardmember, executive, and directormanager 
level. Report having cybersecurity insurance. Report having more open and transparent 
relationships with customers based on 
more frequent communication. However, 
the strength of the relationship is not a free 
pass for losing data in cyber breaches, as 
most reported they would lose customers 
if they lost data in a breach.USTelecom.orgcybersurvey\|USTELECOM 2021 CYBERSECURITY SURVEY15KEY FINDINGS13%of SMBs use

the victims control, becoming an inevitable and 
unavoidable cost of doing business in the digital 
age. It is not a matter of if youll be attacked, but 
when, as well as how you will prepare and respond. 
Fortunately, cyber insurance gives organizations 
the option to transfer that risk to other entities. The 
survey found that 75% of participants have existing 
cybersecurity insurance policies. In interviews with 
executives, it was noted that there is some skepticism 
around the value of cyber insurance. One CEO 
admitted that, although they are considering cyber 
insurance, they do not currently have it due to a lack 
of research. Another revealed the heavy focus on cost 
reduction has resulted in their organization struggling 
to understand the strategic aspect of investing in 
cybersecurity insurance.The U.S. government continuously issues cyber 
guidance, adapting and updating its publications, as 
the cyber landscape changes. As new information is 
gathered and understood, researchers work tirelessly 
to issue alerts and distill and organize best practices 
for other organizations to implement. Uptake of 
these education and awareness tools, or lack thereof, 
is important to understanding the effectiveness of 
government efforts to support organizations in their 
management and prioritization. On average, 13% on 
average of the SMBs indicated they used guidance 
issued by the Department of Homeland Security 
Cybersecurity \& Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS
CISA) to make cybersecurity decisions. It is worth 
noting this percentage reflects that companies are 
not only aware of government guidance, but also 
use the material to enhance security posture. The 
effective uptake of government guidance, or lack 
thereof, is important for government and industry 
practitioners to understand, and collaborative efforts 
should be undertaken to expand awareness and use of 
thoughtfully curated material. Government guidance 
that is accompanied by cost\-effective analyses likely 
would expand adoption by helping companies 
prioritize security investments based on traditional 
business analyses.16USTELECOM 2021 CYBERSECURITY SURVEY\|USTelecom.orgcybersurveySURVEY METHODOLOGY AND PARAMETERS1\.QUALITATIVE: Fourteen in\-depthsurveys with SMB Chief ExecutiveOfficers (CEOs) and C\-Level executivesto identify and better understandwhere cybersecurity gaps and barriersexist and explore steps that should betaken to enhance the cybersecurity ofthe organizations they represent.2\.QUANTITATIVE: An online survey ofemployees, directorsmanagers, andexecutives of SMBs with up to 2,500employees.
