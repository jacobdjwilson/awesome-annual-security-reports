The State of Cloud

DARK READING RESEARCH | THE STATE OF CLOUD

Executive Summary
Recent tech headlines tell a clear story that cloud governance and security issues are
getting worse. Cloud-originated breaches and data exposures continue to mount, and it
is clear that adversaries are increasingly targeting cloud assets to their criminal ambitions.

There are number of reasons that cloud risks are growing, but data from Dark Reading’s
The State of Cloud Survey 2021 indicates that one of the biggest is a persistent lack of

utilized by organizations today and the tools they use to track and manage their cloud

security afforded by these tools. We then validated those perceptions against an existing
body of research data from Censys security experts across real-world cloud deployments

This comparison uncovers what appears to be a perception gap between organizations’

affairs.

Key Findings
The study found that:

Visibility and Tracking of Cloud
Assets Remain Lackluster

Rogue Cloud Assets are More
Common Than Respondents Realize

•  82% of respondents say they use

four or fewer public cloud providers.

•  Only 2% of organizations indicate

they use more than seven providers.

•  Deployment statistics show Fortune
500 cloud environments use an
average of 25 different cloud
providers.

Cloud Security Tooling Still Needs
Work

•

 83% of organizations say identifying

top cloud security priority.

•  Yet only 57% say maintaining
a comprehensive inventory is
a top concern, meaning many
organizations can’t identify risks in
assets they don’t know about.

•  The top security tool respondents
use to control cloud assets is
vulnerability management, and only
43% of organizations use it.

•

 52% of respondents say they either
don’t know what they use to track
their cloud assets, don’t track them
at all, or use manual means of
tracking such as spreadsheets.

•  Fewer than one-third of

tooling to track cloud assets.

•  The most commonly named

obstacles that keep them from
tracking cloud inventory are time,
budget, and lack of headcount.

•  This contrasts with the high

resources in Fortune 500 cloud
deployments; data from Censys
found 1.9 million Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) exposures in just a
dozen common cloud providers.

The Perception vs.
Realities of Cloud

Despite a steady stream of very public
cloud exposures in the news and
increasing evidence that organizations
struggle with cloud visibility and control,

within their respective environments.
Approximately 57% of organizations are

Some 52% say they either don’t know what

track them at all, or use manual means
of tracking such as spreadsheets to keep
tabs on their cloud asset portfolio. The

for keeping tabs on cloud assets, the

exhibit translates to a perceived surety
that unauthorized cloud assets are not
a problem in their environments. Only
about 25% of respondents admit that their
organization struggles with rogue cloud

say they do not have rogue cloud assets in
their organization.

When we think about this in light of the
high rates of manual or non-existent
tracking, the picture starts to crystallize:
Organizations are counting on their
policies to shield them from rogue assets
and untracked cloud sprawl. Our survey
shows that 75% of organizations have
corporate policies around how and by
whom cloud services are provisioned and
managed.

Figure 3.

We can show incontrovertibly that these

leaders think, though. We’ve accomplished
this by comparing the average volume of
cloud provider relationships reported by
this survey’s respondents to the volume

infrastructure.

Approximately 67% of respondents say
they work with public cloud providers,
with 18% stating they utilize a fully public
cloud deployment model and 49% saying
they rely on a hybrid model (Figure 3).
The majority of our survey respondents say
they limit the number of relationships they
have with public cloud providers, with 82%
stating they use four or fewer providers. A
slim 2% of organizations report using more
than seven providers (Figure 4).

And yet, when you compare these
statistics with data gleaned from readily

recent
research report on Fortune 500 cloud

that organizations are using, on average,
25 different cloud providers in their
ecosystems.

Even accounting for some sample bias and
differences between each data set — which
are likely minimal since the organizations
in this survey were primarily large ones
with more than 1,000 employees — the
difference between what respondents
think their cloud environments look like
compared to what’s observably lurking is
extreme.

This is likely due to the inherent nature
of cloud and the ability of individuals
throughout an organization to easily create

The Hidden Cloud

Of course, it isn’t just cloud sprawl that
organizations appear to have distorted
perceptions about. Comparing the survey
results to measurable observations from

The Tools and Teams
Currently in Place
So why do risks remain hidden at so many
organizations, and does the gap linger
when it comes to perceived and actual
risk of cloud exposure? Organizations are
clearly struggling to gain visibility over the
full portfolio of cloud assets, and a lot of
this likely comes down to the tools they’re
using.

As mentioned above, more than half of
organizations don’t have an automated
method for gaining visibility of their cloud
environment in its entirety. Among those
who do have tooling, the most commonly
used tools are asset management tools
(used by 38% of organizations) and cloud
security posture management tools
(30%), which are almost neck and neck in
prevalence.

Other frequently used tools include
cloud security posture management and

When looking at funding priorities for
cloud controls, we shouldn’t expect any
big shakeups in these percentages, as
vulnerability management again leads the
pack at 42%, followed by cloud-enabled

DevSecOps and

As DevOps and self-service precepts
increasingly take hold within enterprise
organizations, the role of developers

resources for test, dev, and production
environments continues to grow.

As enterprise security teams try to
stay aligned with these trends through

with how they can control and monitor

At the programmatic level, the majority of
organizations say they do have some kind
of third-party risk management program to
manage cybersecurity risks from cloud and
other vendors. However, among those that
have a program, fewer than half are staffed
by dedicated cybersecurity professionals to
run them. About a third of these programs
are shouldered by cybersecurity pros with
other duties, which could be a sign they
may be programs in name only for the sake
of compliance.
