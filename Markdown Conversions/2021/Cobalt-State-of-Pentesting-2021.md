“There’s no silver bullet solution with cybersecurity, a layered defense is the only viable defense.” - James Scott, Senior Fellow and co-founder of ICIT

As security teams continue to search for ways to deter cyberattacks, it becomes more obvious that multiple lines of defense are the most sound strategy they can take. As business priorities increasingly revolve around engineering output and data privacy, multiple testing types integrate more closely with different stages of the Software Development Lifecycle and link up to discover vulnerabilities before it’s too late.

And yet there are issues that routinely slip past teams’ watchful eyes. As a pentest provider, Cobalt witnesses firsthand how vulnerabilities ranging from Low to High severity make it to software and systems that handle terabytes of sensitive information.

We publish our annual State of Pentesting report to shed light on what those vulnerabilities are, and identify the trends and hazards that impact the cybersecurity community. We collect the data via our proprietary Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform, which connects security teams with a carefully curated and thoroughly vetted community of pentesters to examine their systems and software.

This year, we looked at data from 1602 pentests performed in 2020 to learn about the assets getting tested, the vulnerabilities being discovered, and how that data changes across different industries and company sizes. We identified an interesting trend: our customers have been struggling with the same top 5 vulnerabilities for 4 years in a row. Despite the fact that they are well-known to the industry, teams struggle to effectively remove and prevent issues like Server Security Misconfigurations and Cross-Site Scripting from their environments.

To understand why that was, we surveyed 601 companies (not Cobalt customers) to learn how they pursue secure development, how they pentest and remediate vulnerabilities, and where there is room for process improvements for both internal teams and security vendors.

What we found was an interesting mixture of pain points, workflow challenges, and suggestions on how pentesting can evolve as a layer of defense that can help validate the effectiveness of all the other controls that come before it.

## Vulnerabilities
We began the hunt for trends by examining the data from our Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform. We looked at the types of tests we performed and the types of security issues our pentesters found in 2020. From our sample of 1602 pentests, the majority of our customers came to us specifically for Web Application testing or Web App and API testing—nearly 75% of them. The rest of our sample was made up of combinations of Mobile, External Network, and Internal Network testing.

### How much risk are teams managing?
When we discover vulnerabilities, we rate them according to the OWASP methodology, based on their likelihood of exploitation and impact if exploited. Likelihood includes the level of skill an attacker would need to exploit a vulnerability, the availability of documented exploits, and the relative ease of exploitation. The Impact includes the effect on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data or systems, as well as potential financial or reputational losses.

**VULNERABILITY RISK RATING**
- **High**: Vulnerabilities that introduce the most risk of disruption, due to the high impact and high likelihood. Cobalt recommends addressing vulnerabilities at this level as quickly as possible.
- **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that introduce a moderate amount of business risk. These include risks with high impact but low likelihood, and risks with low impact but high likelihood. Cobalt recommends addressing these vulnerabilities to improve the overall security posture.
- **Low**: Vulnerabilities that introduce a relatively small amount of risk, but could still have some impact or likelihood. Cobalt recommends addressing these vulnerabilities when there are no higher priority items.

![Vulnerability risk rating chart: 15.4% Low, 53.6% Medium, 31.0% High]

### What vulnerability categories are the most common?
To get a glimpse of what flaws slip past security teams’ internal checks, we continue our analysis with the top 5 most common vulnerability categories that our pentester community discovered. Unsurprisingly, 2020’s list reveals vulnerabilities that are also outlined in the OWASP Top 10:

We have analyzed our data for the State of Pentesting report every year since 2018, and these vulnerability categories have consistently been our top 5 for each report. The order in which they appear has shifted over time, but Server Security Misconfigurations have been at the top of the list, and by a significant margin, every year running.

This leads us to believe that security teams are struggling to effectively remove and prevent issues that are well-known to the industry. There can be several reasons for this—gaps in secure development, insufficient investment in security awareness and training, ineffective remediation, or bugs staying open because of low perceived impact and/or lack of resources. We explore more anecdotal data on this point under “Remediation.”

1.  Server Security Misconfigurations: 28.1%
2.  Cross-Site Scripting: 15.5%
3.  Broken Access Control: 14.7%
4.  Sensitive Data Exposure: 8.4%
5.  Authentication and Sessions: 8%

**Top 5 Most Common Vulnerabilities**

High-risk vulnerabilities were in the minority among our customers, while more than half of the Findings we discovered were rated Low. However, we still recommend that clients address the Medium- and Low-risk vulnerabilities, because an attacker could find a way to chain several of those less-severe findings together to gain greater access. We explore this observation in more detail under “Remediation.”

**Why Three Groups?** A lot of pentesting organizations group vulnerabilities differently, having a Critical category for the most Likely and most Impactful vulnerabilities, and an Informational category for vulnerabilities with a very low risk. Cobalt sticks with the High, Medium, and Low categories because labeling one item as “Critical” can make other still-risky vulnerabilities sound less important, and labeling an issue as “Informational” can make it sound like it’s not worth fixing.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Reflected XSS**: When an attacker passes script code to the server in a user-editable location within a request, the application returns it as part of the server’s response, which the user’s browser interprets and renders as part of the page.
- **Stored XSS**: When an attacker passes script code to the server in a user-editable location within a request, the application stores it on the server. When another user accesses the affected page, that user’s browser interprets and renders the stored code as part of the page.

**Vulnerability Category**: The root cause for both of these findings is that the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site-Scripting attacks, which happens when the application does not validate and encode user-supplied input properly, so it gets treated as code, rather than as text.

### Looking deeper into our data
This year we’re diving one level deeper into our analysis by observing the specific findings that come up across different methodologies, industries and company sizes. Going this granular helps us determine risk more accurately—for example, with Cross-Site Scripting the risk differs considerably between the Stored and Reflected findings.

But first, a word on taxonomy. Different pentest providers—and cybersecurity organizations as a whole—use different terminology and frameworks to describe their data. To help readers follow our report, here is an overview of the taxonomy we use at Cobalt, which is mostly guided by OWASP best practices:

The building block of our taxonomy are Findings, which are the individual issues our testers discover. Findings are then grouped into a vulnerability category. For example:

With this system in mind, we looked at the top 5 findings from our entire 2020 database, regardless of vertical or asset type. Here’s what we found:

At first glance, the percentages might look small, but that’s in part because of the total number of findings we observe in our platform. Among 286 possible options that are grouped into 23 vulnerability categories, these top 5 findings were the most commonly discovered and represent roughly 30% of our data.

It’s interesting to note that both of Cross-Site Scripting’s variations appeared frequently in our pentests. Despite the fact that this vulnerability became big news over 10 years ago—and some parts of the community have gone so far as to declare it dead—our data and the OWASP Top 10 lists suggest otherwise. And while this type of vulnerability is rarely reflected in big breach stories, its impact on both companies and their customers is not negligible, risking exposure to highly sensitive information.

1.  Broken Access Control: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): 9.4% of total findings
2.  Cross-Site Scripting: Stored: 8.7%
3.  Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Outdated Software: 4.1%
4.  Broken Access Control: Username/Email Enumeration: 3.8%
5.  Cross-Site Scripting: Reflected: 3.7%

**Top 5 Findings For 2020**

### What are different assets vulnerable to?
While the top 5 overall findings help set the tone for what specific issues security teams can focus on, they won’t be helpful to every reader. You’ll notice that many of these findings will relate to web assets, and that’s partly because the majority of pentests we did in 2020 covered web applications.

To help readers determine the most prevalent threats to their mobile applications, networks, or even combinations of different assets, we’ve broken the data down to the top 3 findings observed from different testing methodologies.

| Asset Type         | 1st Place                                                              | 2nd Place                                                              | 3rd Place                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web                | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Stored                                      | Broken Access Control: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)        | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Reflected                                     |
| API                | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Stored                                      | Server Security Misconfiguration: Lack of Security Headers               | Server Security Misconfiguration: Insecure Cipher Suite                   |
| Mobile             | Lack of Binary Hardening: Lack of Jailbreak Detection                   | Broken Access Control: IDOR                                           | Mobile Security Misconfiguration: Absent SSL Certificate Pinning           |
| Internal Network   | Components With Known Vulnerabilities: Outdated Software Version        | Server-Side Injection: Remote Code Execution                           | Server Security Misconfiguration: Using Default Credentials               |
| External Network   | Components With Known Vulnerabilities: Outdated Software Version        | Server Security Misconfiguration: Insecure SSL                         | Server Security Misconfiguration: Insecure Cipher Suite                   |
| Web + API          | Broken Access Control: IDOR                                           | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Stored                                      | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Reflected                                     |
| Web + Mobile       | Lack of Binary Hardening: Lack of Jailbreak Detection                   | Broken Access Control: IDOR                                           | Insecure Data Storage: Sensitive Application Data Storage Unencrypted      |
| Web + External Network | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Stored                                      | Broken Access Control: IDOR                                           | Components With Known Vulnerabilities: Outdated Software Version        |

None of these flaws are 0-day vulnerabilities. All of them have been well-known to the industry for years, which further strengthens our theory that there is an issue with prevention earlier in the Software Development Lifecycle. We explore this theme in more detail under “Remediation.”

### What are different industries vulnerable to?
Some industries are under more pressure than others. For example, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the world in 2020, the Healthcare and E-Learning industries saw an increase in cyber attacks. The FBI reported a 30% increase in attacks against E-Learning targets, and many hospitals and vaccine manufacturers became the targets of phishing campaigns.

Based on news stories like these and our pentesting experience, we were interested in seeing what the data said on the industries that we pentest most frequently.

| Industry   | 1st Place                                 | 2nd Place                                                 | 3rd Place                                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SaaS       | Cross-Site Scripting: Stored              | Broken Access Control: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) | Cross-Site Scripting: Reflected                                  |
| Healthcare | Cross-Site Scripting: Stored              | Broken Access Control: IDOR                               | Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Outdated Software        |
| Fintech    | Broken Access Control: IDOR               | Cross-Site Scripting: Stored                              | Components With Known Vulnerabilities: Outdated Software        |
| Insurance  | Cross-Site Scripting: Reflected           | Cross-Site Scripting: Stored                              | Components With Known Vulnerabilities: Outdated Software        |
| E-Learning | Broken Access Control: IDOR               | Cross-Site Scripting: Reflected                           | Cross-Site Scripting: Stored                                     |

*Study limitation: the majority of this data relates to Web applications/API assets. For a detailed breakdown of findings per asset type, please refer to “What are different assets vulnerable to?”

While the order varied slightly from industry to industry, it looked like each dealt with similar flaws: variations of Cross-Site Scripting, Insecure Direct Object References, and Outdated Software Version. That, however, doesn’t mean that different industries deal with the same level of risk.

Consider the following: Many SaaS and Fintech companies completely rely on their technology to keep the business running. But larger enterprises in industries like Insurance and Healthcare are more likely to have multiple ventures and sources of revenue, so the tested technology could only be a small part of the bigger picture.

What’s more, risk doesn’t end with the company’s business operations. It ultimately translates to impact on end users. For example, weak TLS ciphers in a banking app can be critical for both companies and their customers, while the same problem in a gardening app can be considerably less exploitative.

This is also why we want to highlight one concerning trend: industries which are more likely to handle financial, health, or other sensitive data such as Healthcare, Insurance, and Fintech, are still susceptible to IDOR vulnerabilities. This well-known flaw could allow an attacker to bypass authorization controls and access Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI). These instances are examples of higher risk for both the company and its customers. We recommend that companies whose reports list this vulnerability address it as a high priority.

Aside from considering what industries are vulnerable to, it’s also worth exploring metrics that show how vulnerable they are. For example, it would be much less alarming if the number of findings per asset was contained to an average of 1 or 2, than if companies were observing a number closer to 10.

In exploring this question, we learned that each industry had room to improve, but E-Learning stood out both with its average number of findings, and what proportion of those carried High and Medium levels of risk.

This could be because many E-Learning businesses had to respond to surging demand for digital solutions during the pandemic. We can easily picture the scenario where businesses were pushed to prioritize faster deployments over secure development. Security teams likely looked to pentests to compensate for what slipped past internal checks—one of many examples of how pentests can act as an effective layer of defense if teams are able to effectively remediate their findings.

| Industry   | Avg # of findings per asset | High Risk | Medium Risk | Low Risk |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| SaaS       | 6.5                         | 11%       | 31%         | 58%      |
| Healthcare | 5.4                         | 14%       | 27%         | 59%      |
| Fintech    | 4.9                         | 7%        | 24%         | 69%      |
| Insurance  | 6.2                         | 16%       | 24%         | 60%      |
| E-Learning | 8.4                         | 17%       | 38%         | 45%      |

## Remediation
Earlier in our report we found that the top 5 most common vulnerability categories in our database have stayed the same every year since 2018. When we consult other sources, such as the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities report, this problem goes back even further. For example, Cross-Site Scripting and Broken Access Control have made the list in each iteration since 2003. Security Misconfigurations have also been a prevalent entry, dropping out of the list in 2007 only to reappear in later releases.

This observation raises the inevitable question: why is the industry struggling with the same well-known problems for so long?

To answer this, we wanted to better understand how security practitioners both prevent vulnerabilities and remediate what their pentests discover. We wanted to know if there were any internal issues that limited teams to higher priority items, but also if there were external factors that were coming from their pentest providers.

In Q1 of this year, we spoke to 601 IT security professionals across the United States, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, all of whom worked for companies with 500 or more employees. They were generally familiar with pentesting, and had previously used pentesting at their companies. More information on our methodology is included in Appendix B.

To start, respondents identified and fixed 54 vulnerabilities on average in the last calendar year. And yet 6 out of 10 said they saw these same issues re-emerge at a later date. Why? We have a few theories.

### Theory #1: Detecting vulnerabilities before code goes live is still a work in progress.
Before we dive into pentesting-related theories, we want to look at the bigger picture and understand why preventable issues slip past initial checks and only come up after a third party tests for them.

**Results**: Nearly all respondents (96%) agreed that they have to follow secure development principles to prevent vulnerabilities from re-emerging. We wanted to know how they work towards achieving that:

![Bar chart showing percentage of respondents using different security checks in the SDLC: Code Reviews 43%, Threat Modeling 53%, Playbooks & Training 62%, DAST/SAST/IAST Analysis 65%, Abuse Case Tests 32%, Fuzzing 19%, Other 10%]

Following secure development principles doesn’t always mean that each of these points needs to be at 100%. Of the 43% who don’t use code reviews, for example, some might not be using it as diligently as they need to, while others might not need it in the first place. But the fact stands that vulnerabilities slip past these checks, as evidenced by our own data.

What this graph can tell us is that security teams are using a combination of measures to prevent vulnerabilities early on, which is something we strongly support. It takes multiple approaches to secure one’s environment. Pentesting isn’t the panacea of application security, but it can validate all the other pieces of a security program and help inform what areas need to be improved.

### Theory #2: Teams struggle to detect everything that slips past internal checks because they can’t pentest their entire application portfolio.
In addition to this theory, we also wanted to see if there were other challenges, for example with procurement and setup.

**Results**: Even though 78% of study participants agree that pentesting is a high-priority item for their security teams, respondents only conduct pentesting on 63% of their overall application portfolio on average. What challenges could be causing this disconnect?

![Bar chart showing percentage of respondents who agree with the listed statements: Too difficult to find/hire people with the right skillset 86%, Pentesting is too expensive 58%, Pentesting is difficult to scope 61%, Pentesting is too slow to schedule 54%]

- **Talent Matching**: 86% of respondents agreed that it is difficult to find and/or hire people with the right skill sets for pentesting.
- **Expense**: 58% of our panelists believe that pentesting is too expensive, with 42% going so far as to say their company does not have the budget to cover it.
- **Scoping Difficulties**: 61% said that pentesting is difficult to scope.
- **Timing**: Over half of the security professionals we interviewed agreed that pentesting is too slow to schedule. How slow, exactly? Only 22% said they are able to get pentesting scheduled within days; most have to wait weeks (55%) and some even divulged that it takes their organization months (22%) to get a pentest project off the ground.

Aside from limiting how much teams can pentest, these pain points also lead to longer periods of time between new code being pushed, and pentests revealing where it is vulnerable. That can translate to months of exposure that no one is aware of and can mitigate.

None of these setbacks are connected to how engineering and security teams work together. Instead, they are symptoms of a wider problem: the established pentesting procurement process makes this security control less accessible, and therefore less reliable. To enable security teams, pentests need to be available with appropriate talent on-demand, with simpler setup and more flexible pricing.

### Theory #3: Teams might be taking too long to address Medium- or Low-risk findings.
**Results**: Nearly all (93%) of respondents reported that their business solves critical vulnerabilities quickly. The response to Low- or Medium-risk vulnerabilities was more sluggish, with two-thirds of our respondents agreeing that it took their team longer to respond to these issues than it did to address High-risk attack points. Over half (51%) confessed that their companies were too slow in responding to these lower-risk issues, and 67% feel that this practice creates significant risk to business, considering that these supposedly low-urgency vulnerabilities can chain together and escalate into very serious problems. To minimize risk and prevent chained exploits, 79% of our study participants agreed that their organizations need to focus just as much on Low or Medium vulnerabilities as they do High.

However, 25% of respondents reported that their company takes up to 60 days—or longer—to address Low/Medium-risk vulnerabilities, and a small but nonetheless surprising segment (1%) of companies don’t bother to remediate them at all.

![Text boxes showing survey results: 93% agree "My company solves for critical vulnerabilities quickly", 66% agree "My company takes more time to solve for medium and low vulnerabilities than it does for critical ones", 51% agree "My company takes too long to solve for medium and low vulnerabilities", 67% agree "Lack of urgent response to medium and low vulnerabilities creates big risk for our business", 79% agree "My organization needs to focus just as much on low/medium vulnerabilities as we do high in order to prevent chained exploits"]

Why is this such poor practice? For a case study on the potentially disastrous consequences of postponing so-called “low-urgency” remediation, look no further than the 2017 Equifax breach. This breach exposed the personal information of 148 million people—more than 40% of the population of the United States at the time—and resulted in a record-shattering $700 million FTC settlement, their CEO stepping down amid massive public controversy, and $1.4 billion spent cleaning up the mess. So how did this catastrophic breach occur? It happened because of a widely-known software vulnerability for which a patch was made available—a patch that Equifax, due to oversight in their internal processes, failed to deploy. Cobalt’s Chief Strategy Officer Caroline Wong breaks it down: “This was not a crazy technical problem that lacked a solution. The technical solution was available; this was a lack of people and process innovation.”

### Theory #4: Remediation teams could be limited to critical findings because of workflow issues.
**Results**: There is definite room for improvement here. Security and engineering teams still have work to do to effectively collaborate, on remediation priorities and more generally. The outcome is lower-risk findings staying exposed for longer and coming up again at a later test.

What is holding them back? Largely, the answers are inefficient workflows and lack of automation integrations. A majority of security respondents agreed that they can collaborate better with their engineering colleagues—much better, in some cases. Half of our respondents reported that the relationship between security and engineering teams within their company was strong, but with room for improvement; 18% said the relationship between these teams was neutral, in that their teams occasionally worked together, but not as often as they should; and 2% of respondents called this relationship poor, reporting that their team rarely worked together with engineers at their company. Only 3 in 10 respondents were able to happily report that their company’s security and engineering teams were “intertwined.”

So what are the biggest challenges teams need to address in order to improve DevSecOps workflows? We posed this question to our respondents and here is what they had to say:

![Bar chart showing the biggest challenges teams face when implementing DevSecOps: Too many manual processes 58%, Knowledge gaps re. other team’s area 43%, Lack of AppSec tool integrations 40%, Security teams too small to keep up 38%, Misalignment between KPIs 28%]

Let’s focus on manual processes and AppSec tool integrations, particularly around remediating pentest findings. Once security teams have pentest findings in hand, how are they sending them over to their colleagues in engineering?

Nearly three-quarters of respondents said that this was handled manually within their organization—either the findings were manually pushed to issue tracking software (39%) or worse, the engineering team was manually sent a PDF shared by the pentest provider (34%). Perhaps then it is not surprising that when there was misalignment with remediation priorities, half our respondents said that their engineering teams blamed workflow inefficiencies.

Why is this important? Most of the time the engineering team also makes up the remediation team—and asking them to address Low- and Medium-risk findings with the same urgency as highly critical ones is a big request when you factor in their commitments to roadmap execution, business enablement, and customer satisfaction. Clearly, security teams cannot pile requests onto these teams unless they explore ways to free up their time with more efficient and automated processes. For example, engineering is not involved in pentesting setup or execution and they rarely have a say in how findings are packaged and shared with them—these are all handled by the security team. Therefore, the responsibility lies with the latter to improve this workflow in order to push toward DevSecOps and remediate more effectively.

## Conclusion
Our data strongly suggests that security teams are still struggling with the same well-known vulnerabilities that have plagued the industry for years. Flaws like Cross-Site Scripting and Broken Access Control, which were among the top 5 vulnerabilities in our 2020 data, have also been listed as a prevalent security issue in the OWASP Top 10 every year since 2003.

As much as teams aim for secure development, we conclude there are still gaps in prevention and remediation. As to what might be causing them, and where pentesting plays a part, we discovered the following:

1.  The majority of teams pursue some form of secure development, but they don’t catch everything. Pentesting is still a valuable and effective layer of defense.
2.  To empower security teams to test new code earlier, pentesting needs to be faster and easier to set up, and more financially accessible.
3.  Ignoring or delaying remediation for Medium- and Low-risk pentest findings can escalate into a larger issue that is more costly to fix.
4.  What holds remediation teams back with fixing pentest findings are too many manual tasks and a lack of tool integrations.

For the final point, we tested a few innovation ideas with our survey respondents to learn what they felt is the best way to improve workflows and get more done with less. The most popular was real-time delivery of findings instead of a PDF report (57%), closely followed by choosing a provider that offers software integrations that automatically share information and status updates between both teams’ dashboards (56%). Half our respondents wanted to see API integrations that allow for data consolidation and visualization, and an honorable mention went to dedicated communication channels for security, engineering, and pentesters to collaborate (37%).

These very innovations and more are what define the movement toward Pentest as a Service (PtaaS). Cobalt’s Pentest as a Service (PtaaS) platform, coupled with an exclusive community of testers, delivers the real-time insights you need to remediate risk quickly and innovate securely.

### The PtaaS Advantage
| Feature        | Traditional Pentesting                                                                       | Pentest as a Service                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tools          | Disconnected Few to no shared digital tools, findings are collected in a PDF report and sent via email | Integrated Cloud platform hosts all relevant pentest information and distributes it via bi-directional integrations with issue trackers, or an open API |
| Alignment With DevOps | Restricted Pentests have to be scheduled months in advance and happen once or twice a year despite frequent code deployments | Flexible On-demand tests begin in 24 hours for either ad-hoc needs or as part of a continuous program in sync with code releases                                |
| Workflows      | Siloed Limited information on bug reproduction and communication overhead between engineers, pentesters and security teams | Collaborative Descriptive findings delivered in cloud platform where teams can collaborate in real time                                                                  |
| Analytics      | Vague Limited exposure to data on vulnerabilities’ criticality and distribution along the codebase | Detailed In-platform dashboards or open API provide details on aggregated risk, vulnerability severity and distribution across assets                                |
