## Survey Method
The research was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of NortonLifeLock among 10,030 adults (aged 18+) in 10 countries. The survey was conducted February 15-28, 2021 in Australia (n=1,005), France (n=1,000), Germany (n=1,001), India (n=1,000), Italy (n=1,000), Japan (n=1,020), Netherlands (n=1,000), New Zealand (n=1,004), the United Kingdom (n=1,000), and the United States (n=1,000). Data are weighted where necessary to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population; India was weighted to the population of those who are online. Weighted variables varied by country and included one or more of the following: age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, internet usage, household size, household income, size of place, and propensity to be online. A global postweight was applied to ensure equal weight of each country in the global total.  
Population projection estimates cited are calculated based on adult population (age 18+) figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2021 International Data Base and Pew Research Center 2017 Global Attitudes Survey.  No estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.
Throughout the report, references to YOY changes represent differences in results from the 2019 Global NLCSIR Study, conducted online by the Harris Poll on behalf of NortonLifeLock among 10,063 adults (aged 18+) in 10 countries from November 5 to December 2, 2019.

## Cybercrime: Incidence, Impact, & Attitudes
In a year filled with restrictions and lockdowns, cybercriminals were not deterred as nearly 330 million adults in 10 countries* experienced cybercrime in the past 12 months. Despite many consumers saying they are taking more precautions online because they are concerned about cybercrime, more than 2 in 5 feel more vulnerable to cybercrime than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic, and half aren’t sure how to protect themselves.

## Online Creeping
While over one-third of adults* who have been in a romantic relationship admit to online “stalking” their current or former partners, most consumers do not condone it. However, there are glaring differences in attitudes and awareness across countries between those under 40 and those 40+, with younger adults being much more likely to condone online stalking, to be aware of creepware, or to think their partner would be likely to plant it on their device.
