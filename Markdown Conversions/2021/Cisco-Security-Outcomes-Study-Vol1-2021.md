The 2021 Security Outcomes StudyPoised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program[Introduction](#introduction)

When we set out to develop this study, our main goal was to provide a practical
tool for you, the security leader, to guide your investments, propel you to achieve
success in your security program, and better manage risk .

With a global representation (25 countries and over 4,800 respondents), we aim
to empirically measure what factors drive the best security outcomes. This is quite
different than what we have created in the past in our Cybersecurity Report Series,
and we hope that this new approach and tone is refreshing and welcomed.

As we know, security is ever evolving to the point that success can sometimes
feel elusive. So we set out to answer some questions in this study: How can
we efficiently and effectively manage our cybersecurity risk? How is it that
even the largest companies with the biggest security budgets still struggle to
achieve certain outcomes? With all the various options out there for achieving
a successful cybersecurity program, which ones should practitioners focus on?
New technology? More training? Better incident response procedures? The
possibilities are endless. How can a security team determine what will work
best? And what’s to say that won’t change? (Spoiler alert, it will.)

This study will provide you with an extra boost of insight and confidence to get
focused for 2021 and beyond. The past year has been challenging – even more so
than usual, but there are always steps that can be taken to progress your security
strategy. Read on to find out which actions may work best for your organization.

About the survey

Sampling

Respondents

Analysis

Cisco contracted a survey
research firm, YouGov, to field
a fully anonymous (source and
respondent) survey that ran
during the middle of 2020.

We surveyed over 4,800
active IT, security, and
privacy professionals from
25 countries. Sample
demographics including
industries, company size,
and region can be found in
[Appendix A](#appendix-a-sample-demographics).

Approach

The Cyentia Institute conducted
an independent analysis of
the survey data on behalf of
Cisco and generated all results
presented in this study.

*   We asked respondents about their organization’s adherence to 25 security practices
spanning governance, strategy, spending, architecture, and operations.
*   We then asked about each program’s level of success across roughly a dozen high-level
security objectives or outcomes organized into three main categories: Enabling the Business,
Managing Risk, and Operating Efficiently.
*   Next, we conducted extensive multivariate analysis to identify security practices that correlate
strongly with successful program-level outcomes.

[Key Findings](#key-findings)

Is there evidence that security practices
actually do affect program-level outcomes?

Out of the 275 practice-outcome combinations, 45%
show significant correlation – meaning a specific practice
affected the likelihood of achieving a certain outcome.

The strongest correlation of them all?

A proactive, best-of-breed tech refresh strategy allows
you to keep up with business growth.

What about the second strongest correlation?

A well-integrated tech stack improves recruitment and
retention of security talent.

Want to achieve overall program success?

Devote resources to proactive tech refresh and integrate
your technology.

Want a strong security culture that’s
embraced by all?

Focus on good equipment, clear direction, accurate alerts,
and timely fixes of security issues.

The 2021 Security Outcomes StudyPoised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security ProgramWhere are we going?
[Security Program Outcomes](#where-are-we-going-security-program-outcomes)

Many security studies (and programs) start by focusing on what we’re doing rather
than where we’re headed. But a successful security program isn’t just a set of
directions; it’s a journey toward a destination. And understanding where we are on
the journey helps put everything else in proper perspective.

We’ve started with an admittedly difficult task — identifying a set of diverse, program-level
objectives and related outcomes that security leaders desire to achieve. These outcomes
are an aspirational “security destination” so to speak, even if we know we’ll never quite get
to this ideal. Every security leader and program is different, so we’re certain you’ll think of
various additions and modifications to our proposed list based on your own use cases. At
the same time, we hope you’ll agree that they’re a reasonable and relevant set of strategic
outcomes that lay a solid foundation for framing out this study.

Survey respondents were asked to consider and rate how their organization is
performing for each outcome in [Table 1](#table-1) on a scale of ‘struggling’ to ‘succeeding.’ We
recognize that subjective, abstract concepts like ‘keeping up with the demands of
the business’ can be difficult to grasp and rate, so we presented respondents with
example evidence for each outcome to guide their assessment (see [Appendix B](#appendix-b-full-listing-of-security-outcomes)).

[Table 1: Security program outcomes used in this study](#table-1)

Objective: Enabling the Business | Objective: Managing Risk | Objective: Operating Efficiently
---|---|---
*   Keeping up with the
    demands and growth of
    the business (EB1) | *   Managing the top cyber
    risks to the organization
    (MR1) | *   Running a cost-effective
    security program (OP1)
*   Gaining the confidence
    and trust of executive
    leadership (EB2) | *   Meeting regulatory
    compliance requirements
    (MR2) | *   Minimizing unplanned work
    and wasted effort (OP2)
*   Obtaining buy-in
    from peers and other
    organizational units (EB3) | *   Avoiding major security
    incidents and losses (MR3) | *   Recruiting and retaining
    talented security personnel
    (OP3)
*   Creating a security
    culture embraced by all
    employees (EB4) |  | *   Streamlining incident
    detection and response
    processes (OP4)

Moving beyond context and caveats, let’s get back to the question at hand — where
on their journey towards a successful security program are the 4,800 organizations
represented in this study? [Figure 1](#figure-1) shows the percentage of firms that say their
security program is successfully achieving each respective outcome in our list. So,
roughly 48% of organizations look to be meeting compliance requirements, 46% are
gaining executive confidence, and so on, down to the 36% who say their programs
are minimizing unplanned work.

The overall rate of success at the program level is 42%, which we can’t help
but notice also happens to be The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the
Universe, and Everything. Coincidence? We think not, which is why we pivoted
the entire figure around outcomes exhibiting a success rate above and below
42%. This format helps draw out the consensus among respondents as to which
outcomes are easier to achieve (those toward the top) and which are more
difficult (toward the bottom).

7

The 2021 Security Outcomes StudyPoised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program[Figure 1: Percent of respondents reporting their firm is succeeding in each security outcome](#figure-1)

The ‘maintaining compliance’ and ‘minimizing unplanned work’ are polar opposites
on this chart. This won’t come as a shock to the many security professionals who
see so-called “checkbox compliance” as the epitome of an inefficient security
program. And it hints at the inherent trade-offs that exist when pursuing objectives
like those we show here. We’ll revisit the notion of trade-offs later when we
identify program success factors.

The categorical overlay adds another interesting dimension to [Figure 1](#figure-1). It’s
apparent that outcomes within the ‘Managing Risk’ objective tend to be perceived
as less difficult, while those falling under ‘Operating Efficiently’ are more difficult.
Outcomes associated with ‘Enabling the Business’ run the gamut.

Anyone responsible for leading a cybersecurity program knows that it’s not easy
to manage cyber risk well AND do so with minimal cost. Given the choice, most
organizations take the risk-averse route of spending more to maximize risk reduction.

[Security Practices](#what-are-we-doing-security-practices)

We now examine what organizations are doing to meet the objectives discussed in the
previous section. To do this, we asked respondents about a set of 25 security practices at
their organizations. These practices were drawn from several standards, such as the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and were organized into the categories of Business and
Governance, Strategy and Spending, and Architecture and Operations. Like the outcomes,
these practices are intended to be representative rather than exhaustive. You’ll find
the complete list of practices that fall under each of these categories in [Appendix C](#appendix-c-full-listing-of-security-practices).

[Figure 2](#figure-2) ranks all practices according to the percentage of respondents who strongly
believe their organization is following the tenets of each respective practice. We think the
ratings depicted in the chart are rather optimistic, but we won’t quibble over that because
the adoption of controls and maturity of a cybersecurity program aren’t the focus of this
study. We’re much more interested in how (perceived) security practices relate to the
(perceived) outcomes from the previous section. But we’re not quite ready to go there yet.

The format is the same as that used for outcomes in [Figure 1](#figure-1) and pivots around the
average level of implementation observed across all controls (42.3%). Those at the
top are purportedly easier for firms to implement, while those on the bottom appear
more difficult. We’ll leave you to pick out specific practices of interest and we’ll limit
commentary to a few high-level observations.

Once again, we find the contrasting poles to be a fascinating glimpse into the diverse
nature of security programs. Security professionals used to have to fight hard for
executive attention and support, but respondents indicate that we’ve come a long
way in that regard. On the other hand, some of the fundamentals that the industry has
been working on forever, such as threat detection and vulnerability remediation,
remain a challenge for many organizations. This is a good reminder that “getting
back to the basics” isn’t quite as simple as it sounds.

Looking more broadly at [Figure 2](#figure-2), we see a general pattern of business and
governance factors at the top, strategy in the middle, and architecture and operations
at the bottom. The interpretation of that pattern goes deeper than simply “governance
is easy; tech is hard.” This likely reflects dependencies between these categories — i.e.,
you can’t do the stuff at the bottom well without proper governance and strategy. But
there’s also the reality that most security incidents have some element of architectural
or operational problems at their root. It’s hard to do all the things well all of the time.

Looking for some quick wins?
We ran some additional analysis comparing the relative difficulty of the
practices depicted in [Figure 2](#figure-2) and their correlation with the outcomes listed in
[Figure 1](#figure-1). Our goal was to find practices that aren’t too hard to implement, yet
contribute strongly to security program success. Learn more about those quick
wins in our #SecurityOutcomes blog series.

The 2021 Security Outcomes StudyPoised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program[How do we get there?](#how-do-we-get-there-identifying-success-factors)
Identifying Success Factors

We’ve considered where we want our security programs to go and what we’re
currently doing. Now it’s time to figure out exactly how to achieve those outcomes. Our
overarching question is simple: What contributes to a successful security program?

Since a security program is a complex, inter-dependent system, we analyzed all
practices and outcomes to identify relationships among them. For each practice-
outcome combination, we calculated the change in probability of achieving
outcomes associated with higher levels of adherence to various security practices.
This approach allowed us to derive statistically-sound answers to questions like:

*   Is there evidence that better security practices correlate with better outcomes?
*   Which practices contribute most strongly to successful security outcomes?
*   What are the most effective practices for achieving each specific outcome?
*   How much more likely are you to achieve x if you do y?

Some may see these as simple questions with simple answers. But is that really
the case? The security industry uses many best practices as part of its overall
strategy. Yet we don’t always measure how well those practices work, and
correlate them with desired outcomes.

No really — how did you correlate practices
and outcomes?
Statistics! Many of you may fall asleep (or have recurring nightmares)
after reading this, but the answer is careful, rigorous statistics. In particular,
we utilize multivariate generalized linear models to understand the effects
of each practice on each outcome. That is, we create a logistic regression
where each outcome variable is the dependent variable and all the factors
are independent variables. This allows us to test when factors make a
statistically significant difference and when we might be just seeing the
correlation by chance.

For all you nerds out there, we also go a step further. As you might
remember, the regression coefficients for factors in a logistic regression
don’t quite directly translate to a change in probability. But with a handy
little technique called “Average Marginal Effects” we can figure out how
much an organization might gain from each factor. The well-known adage
“correlation isn’t causation” still applies, but this approach effectively
spotlights potentially useful practice-outcome associations to consider.

11

The 2021 Security Outcomes StudyPoised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security ProgramOverall Program Success
Let’s start by isolating the ‘overall program success’ outcome because it encompasses
all others. [Figure 3](#figure-3) lists factors from top to bottom based on their strength of correlation
with the respondent claiming to have a highly successful security program overall. The
bars and values indicate the expected increase in probability of overall program success
associated with each practice. Because of statistical variation, that increase is expressed
as a range of probability. The middle value marks the average (and most likely) increase
in the likelihood of program success.

According to these results, organizations wanting to maximize the overall success of
their security program should ideally start with a modern, well-integrated tech stack.
Most respondents who said their firm’s tech refresh strategy emphasizes proactive
refreshes using best-of-breed IT and security technologies are 11% to 15% more likely
to report successful programs (12.7% on average). Conversely, those who indicated
that their firms rarely upgrade infrastructure or only do so when things break showed
significantly reduced rates of success. Ensuring that technologies work well together as
an integrated defense increases overall success by an average of about 11%.1

[Figure 3: Practices most strongly correlated with overall security program success](#figure-3)

[Figure 3](#figure-3) shows the change in probability of overall program success as a
range. Read it like this: “A proactive tech refresh strategy increases the chance
of reporting a successful security program by roughly 11% to 15%, with an
average of 12.7%.” Every chart like this can be interpreted in the same fashion.

We fully realize this finding seems suspiciously convenient for a company offering
technologies fitting this description, so we’ll take this opportunity to reiterate that
a professional survey company (YouGov) conducted this survey, participants didn’t
know Cisco was involved, and an independent research firm (Cyentia Institute)
analyzed the data. We’re pleased these results validate Cisco’s strategy and
solutions portfolio, but we played no part in deriving them.

1It should be noted that the probabilities associated with practice-outcome combinations cannot be added together. So,
we cannot say that proactive tech refreshes AND well-integrated tech up the success rate by 23.2% (12.7% + 10.5%).

organizations. Some don’t have the budget; some need to focus their resources and
efforts elsewhere for various legitimate reasons. The good news is that these results
DO NOT relegate such organizations to certain failure. It simply means they need to
identify alternate success factors that work for their situation. That’s exactly what we
hope this analysis helps them do.

After all, having a sufficient security budget was one of the factors we tested, but it did
not significantly correlate with overall program success. So good security isn’t
just about the money. Moving beyond the top two factors in [Figure 3](#figure-3), it’s great to
see measurable benefits tied to having a sound security strategy. That’s something
organizations of all types and sizes can develop. Everything else flows from it.

It’s often said that what makes great leaders is the way they respond to a crisis.
[Figure 3](#figure-3) says that’s a big part of what makes a great security program too. A timely
incident response requires thorough preparation, smart tools, and tested processes.
If you need some justification to improve those capabilities, this chart should help.

The next two success factors go hand-in-hand. Using performance metrics to drive
operations, and then clearly reporting that information to executive leadership, contributes
significantly to program success. This is the core of the OODA loop, and it works.

And that brings us to the last of the success factors — IT, development, and security teams
working together. No, we don’t mean some kind of corporate retreat trust fall exercise
while “Imagine” plays in the background. This factor points to the fact that you can’t do
security well if you can’t do IT and development well (and vice versa). And if that’s true,
doesn’t it make sense to communicate and collaborate so everyone’s more successful?
[Figure 3](#figure-3) shows there’s a benefit to forging strong alliances across the organizational aisle.

One final thing to note is that the top overall success factors span all categories –
operations, governance, and strategy. This suggests that a great security program
can’t be built solely upon great governance or great strategy or great operations.
A winning program requires all of these elements, and the more you do, the better
you do. That theme will continue to reveal itself throughout the next few sections
as we explore success factors for each of the 11 program-level outcomes.

13

The 2021 Security Outcomes StudyPoised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security ProgramWhat appears to be a strong
correlation between continually
upgrading your tech and program
success may spell bad news for
organizations that use technology like
furniture – meaning it sticks around
until it breaks. This indicates that
“newer is better” isn’t just a lifestyle
choice spawned from Silicon Valley.

Read more about this in the Cisco Security Bottom Line Report

[NIST CSF Functions](#nist-csf-functions)
Beyond adherence to specific practices, we also asked respondents about
where their security programs place the greatest priority in terms of investment,
resources, and effort. We used the high-level security functions defined in the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for this.

While the CSF’s Protect function isn’t at the bottom for every outcome, it ranks
next to last for contributing to the overall success of the security program
(Identify ranks #1). That’s certainly counterintuitive, but we don’t see this as
suggesting protection isn’t important. Rather, it indicates that the best programs
invest in a well-rounded set of defenses to identify, protect, detect, respond,
and recover from cyber threats. The field has long been protection-heavy; this
says that protection alone is not the most effective strategy.

Check out our #SecurityOutcomes blog series to see how all five NIST CSF
functions contribute to program outcomes.

[Meeting Security Objectives](#meeting-security-objectives)
Having a security program that is successful overall is a worthy goal, but it’s also
perfectly reasonable (and often necessary) to pursue specific outcomes. Perhaps
you looked at the list of outcomes in [Table 1](#table-1) and thought, “I wonder what factors
would help us achieve [x outcome]?” If so, this section is for you.

Outcomes are organized into the three categories of: Enabling the Business,
Managing Risk, and Operating Efficiently. Under those headings, we provide
several security practices that correlate most strongly with respondents asserting
their programs are successfully achieving each objective. Those wanting the full
list of success factors for any given outcome should sit tight for just a bit; we have
something special for you later in the report.

The four practices of Proactive tech refresh (SS6), Well-integrated tech
(AO1), Timely incident response (AO9), and Prompt disaster recovery (AO10)
significantly contribute to nearly every outcome. Thus, they’re very common
across all charts in this section. As a way of diversifying insights, we generally
focus observations on the top five practices for each outcome besides those
four. Please do not take that as us de-emphasizing their importance. There’s
a strong case that they’re THE most important success factors in this study.

15

The 2021 Security Outcomes StudyPoised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program[Enabling Business](#enabling-business)
As the label implies, outcomes in this section focus on the security program’s
mission of supporting and fostering business activities. This category recognizes that
security doesn’t exist for security’s sake; it serves the business. Let’s see if we can
find tips on how to accomplish that.

Keeping up with the demands and growth of the business

Frequently upgrading to the best available technologies and integrating them to
work well together both feature prominently again in [Figure 4](#figure-4). Since we’ve already
discussed those practices quite a bit, we’ll simply note that this finding makes a
lot of sense to us. The whole notion of ‘keeping up with the business’ means that
security must move, change, and adapt along with revenue-generating activities.
Anyone who’s tried to teach old tech new tricks knows that it’s nearly impossible.
Outdated, fragmented infrastructure hinders the business, period.

The strong link between role-specific security training and enabling the business is
music to our ears. In fact, we made it into a maxim: “Adept people, agile program.”
Some might argue that this is one of the most fundamental themes in modern
security programs. Effective training must be of high quality, consistent with the
culture of the business, and tailored for specific audiences.

[Figure 4: Top security success factors for keeping up with the business (EB1)](#figure-4)

The inclusion of automation in [Figure 4](#figure-4) also makes sense to us. Automation helps
the security program keep up with the business by eliminating bottlenecks and
raising agility across people, processes, and technology. The emphasis on tech
modernization, automation, and integration in [Figure 4](#figure-4) starts to take on a distinctly
DevSecOps appeal.

It may seem odd at first to see incident response (IR) listed as a top business
enabler. But IR isn’t just about putting out fires and cleaning up the mess. It’s
ultimately about handling unexpected events with minimal impact to the business.
And in that light, it makes perfect sense that it makes the cut in [Figure 4](#figure-4).

17

The 2021 Security Outcomes StudyPoised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security ProgramOstensibly, a metrics-driven security program is one that’s used to adjust course in
response to changing conditions. We suspect that’s why performance metrics make
the list for helping security keep pace with the business. There’s no sense in moving
quickly if you’re not sure where you are or where you’re going.

It’s no surprise that having a sufficient budget helps the security program keep up
with the business. This is worth remembering, especially if your business model
involves moving fast and evolving quickly. Proper investments in security show
promise for aiding that momentum.

Gaining the confidence and trust of executive leadership

Score another point for modern, integrated tech. We can’t help but think of executive
SOC visits here (and have a sudden urge to clean our desk and look busy), but at least
there’s some evidence that the "tech tour" song and dance really does work!

Many C-Suite executives view cybersecurity as insurance against landing their
company in the headlines for a major breach or business interruption. Those fears
may be why accurate threat detection and prompt disaster recovery rise high among
factors that correlate with gaining executive confidence. Being able to demonstrate
strong visibility and resilience communicates “we got this” to leadership.

[Figure 5: Top security success factors for gaining executive confidence (EB2)](#figure-5)

Accurate threat detection (AO8) | 6.6%
---|---
Proactive tech refresh (SS6) | 6.5%
Well-integrated tech (AO1) | 6.0%

Source: Cisco 2021 Security Outcomes Study

Having an accurate asset inventory, program performance metrics, and role-specific
training seem to continue the theme of assuaging executives’ fears. Demonstrating
that the security team knows where the crown jewels are located, has the skills to
defend them, and tracks credible metrics to back up the “we got this” message
goes a long way toward earning trust at the top.

Security being important to execs and gaining their confidence seems rather
tautological. This is probably a good example of the “correlation isn’t causation”
adage. If security is important to them, they’re likely supporting the program
