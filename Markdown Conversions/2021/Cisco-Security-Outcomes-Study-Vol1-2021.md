The 2021 Security Outcomes Study
Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program
When we set out to develop this study, our main goal was to provide a practical 
tool for you, the security leader, to guide your investments, propel you to achieve 
success in your security program, and better manage risk.
With a global representation (25 countries and over 4,800 respondents), we aim 
to empirically measure what factors drive the best security outcomes. This is quite 
different than what we have created in the past in our Cybersecurity Report Series, 
and we hope that this new approach and tone is refreshing and welcomed.
As we know, security is ever evolving to the point that success can sometimes 
feel elusive. So we set out to answer some questions in this study: How can 
we efficiently and effectively manage our cybersecurity risk? How is it that 
even the largest companies with the biggest security budgets still struggle to 
achieve certain outcomes? With all the various options out there for achieving 
a successful cybersecurity program, which ones should practitioners focus on? 
New technology? More training? Better incident response procedures? The 
possibilities are endless. How can a security team determine what will work 
best? And whats to say that wont change? (Spoiler alert, it will.) 
This study will provide you with an extra boost of insight and confidence to get 
focused for 2021 and beyond. The past year has been challenging even more so 
than usual, but there are always steps that can be taken to progress your security 
strategy. Read on to find out which actions may work best for your organization.
About the survey
Sampling
Respondents
Analysis
Cisco contracted a survey 
research firm, YouGov, to field 
a fully anonymous (source and 
respondent) survey that ran 
during the middle of 2020\.
We surveyed over 4,800 
active IT, security, and 
privacy professionals from 
25 countries. Sample 
demographics including 
industries, company size, 
and region can be found in 
Appendix A.
The Cyentia Institute conducted 
an independent analysis of 
the survey data on behalf of 
Cisco and generated all results 
presented in this study.
Approach
We asked respondents about their organizations adherence to 25 security practices 
spanning governance, strategy, spending, architecture, and operations.
We then asked about each programs level of success across roughly a dozen high\-level 
security objectives or outcomes organized into three main categories: Enabling the Business, 
Managing Risk, and Operating Efficiently.
Next, we conducted extensive multivariate analysis to identify security practices that correlate 
strongly with successful program\-level outcomes.
Introduction
To bring this report to life, weve worked closely with many experts 
around the world, including our CISO Advisory team. If you need any extra 
incentive to read on, heres a quote to get you inspired:
This is not a marketing report to toss 
in your swag bag and ignore; this 
is a report to cuddle up with and 
read over and over again. In fact, this 
report will change how we think about 
running infosec programs.

Where are we going?
Security Program Outcomes
Many security studies (and programs) start by focusing on what were doing rather 
than where were headed. But a successful security program isnt just a set of 
directions; its a journey toward a destination. And understanding where we are on 
the journey helps put everything else in proper perspective. 
Weve started with an admittedly difficult task identifying a set of diverse, program\-level 
objectives and related outcomes that security leaders desire to achieve. These outcomes 
are an aspirational security destination so to speak, even if we know well never quite get 
to this ideal. Every security leader and program is different, so were certain youll think of 
various additions and modifications to our proposed list based on your own use cases. At 
the same time, we hope youll agree that theyre a reasonable and relevant set of strategic 
outcomes that lay a solid foundation for framing out this study.
Survey respondents were asked to consider and rate how their organization is 
performing for each outcome in Table 1 on a scale of struggling to succeeding. We 
recognize that subjective, abstract concepts like keeping up with the demands of 
the business can be difficult to grasp and rate, so we presented respondents with 
example evidence for each outcome to guide their assessment (see Appendix B).
Table 1: Security program outcomes used in this study

Objective: Operating Efficiently

Moving beyond context and caveats, lets get back to the question at hand where 
on their journey towards a successful security program are the 4,800 organizations 
represented in this study? Figure 1 shows the percentage of firms that say their 
security program is successfully achieving each respective outcome in our list. So, 
roughly 48% of organizations look to be meeting compliance requirements, 46% are 
gaining executive confidence, and so on, down to the 36% who say their programs 
are minimizing unplanned work.
The overall rate of success at the program level is 42%, which we cant help 
but notice also happens to be The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the 
Universe, and Everything. Coincidence? We think not, which is why we pivoted 
the entire figure around outcomes exhibiting a success rate above and below 
42%. This format helps draw out the consensus among respondents as to which 
outcomes are easier to achieve (those toward the top) and which are more 
difficult (toward the bottom).

Figure 1: Percent of respondents reporting their firm is succeeding in each security outcome
The maintaining compliance and minimizing unplanned work are polar opposites 
on this chart. This wont come as a shock to the many security professionals who 
see so\-called checkbox compliance as the epitome of an inefficient security 
program. And it hints at the inherent trade\-offs that exist when pursuing objectives 
like those we show here. Well revisit the notion of trade\-offs later when we 
identify program success factors. 
The categorical overlay adds another interesting dimension to Figure 1\. Its 
apparent that outcomes within the Managing Risk objective tend to be perceived 
as less difficult, while those falling under Operating Efficiently are more difficult. 
Outcomes associated with Enabling the Business run the gamut. 
Anyone responsible for leading a cybersecurity program knows that its not easy 
to manage cyber risk well AND do so with minimal cost. Given the choice, most 
organizations take the risk\-averse route of spending more to maximize risk reduction.

What are we doing?
Security Practices
We now examine what organizations are doing to meet the objectives discussed in the 
previous section. To do this, we asked respondents about a set of 25 security practices at 
their organizations. These practices were drawn from several standards, such as the NIST 
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and were organized into the categories of Business and 
Governance, Strategy and Spending, and Architecture and Operations. Like the outcomes, 
these practices are intended to be representative rather than exhaustive. Youll find 
the complete list of practices that fall under each of these categories in Appendix C.
Figure 2 ranks all practices according to the percentage of respondents who strongly 
believe their organization is following the tenets of each respective practice. We think the 
ratings depicted in the chart are rather optimistic, but we wont quibble over that because 
the adoption of controls and maturity of a cybersecurity program arent the focus of this 
study. Were much more interested in how (perceived) security practices relate to the 
(perceived) outcomes from the previous section. But were not quite ready to go there yet.

We first want to highlight the relative difference among these security practices. 
The format is the same as that used for outcomes in Figure 1 and pivots around the 
average level of implementation observed across all controls (42\.3%). Those at the 
top are purportedly easier for firms to implement, while those on the bottom appear 
more difficult. Well leave you to pick out specific practices of interest and well limit 
commentary to a few high\-level observations. 
Once again, we find the contrasting poles to be a fascinating glimpse into the diverse 
nature of security programs. Security professionals used to have to fight hard for 
executive attention and support, but respondents indicate that weve come a long 
way in that regard. On the other hand, some of the fundamentals that the industry has 
been working on forever, such as threat detection and vulnerability remediation, 
remain a challenge for many organizations. This is a good reminder that getting 
back to the basics isnt quite as simple as it sounds. 
Looking more broadly at Figure 2, we see a general pattern of business and 
governance factors at the top, strategy in the middle, and architecture and operations 
at the bottom. The interpretation of that pattern goes deeper than simply governance 
is easy; tech is hard. This likely reflects dependencies between these categories i.e 
you cant do the stuff at the bottom well without proper governance and strategy. But 
theres also the reality that most security incidents have some element of architectural 
or operational problems at their root. Its hard to do all the things well all of the time.
Looking for some quick wins?
We ran some additional analysis comparing the relative difficulty of the 
practices depicted in Figure 2 and their correlation with the outcomes listed in 
Figure 1\. Our goal was to find practices that arent too hard to implement, yet 
contribute strongly to security program success. Learn more about those quick 
wins in our \#SecurityOutcomes blog series.

How do we get there?
Identifying Success Factors
Weve considered where we want our security programs to go and what were 
currently doing. Now its time to figure out exactly how to achieve those outcomes. Our 
overarching question is simple: What contributes to a successful security program? 
Since a security program is a complex, inter\-dependent system, we analyzed all 
practices and outcomes to identify relationships among them. For each practice\-
outcome combination, we calculated the change in probability of achieving 
outcomes associated with higher levels of adherence to various security practices. 
This approach allowed us to derive statistically\-sound answers to questions like:
Is there evidence that better security practices correlate with better outcomes?
Which practices contribute most strongly to successful security outcomes?
What are the most effective practices for achieving each specific outcome?
How much more likely are you to achieve x if you do y?
Some may see these as simple questions with simple answers. But is that really 
the case? The security industry uses many best practices as part of its overall 
strategy. Yet we dont always measure how well those practices work, and 
correlate them with desired outcomes.
No really how did you correlate practices 
and outcomes?
Statistics! Many of you may fall asleep (or have recurring nightmares) 
after reading this, but the answer is careful, rigorous statistics. In particular, 
we utilize multivariate generalized linear models to understand the effects 
of each practice on each outcome. That is, we create a logistic regression 
where each outcome variable is the dependent variable and all the factors 
are independent variables. This allows us to test when factors make a 
statistically significant difference and when we might be just seeing the 
correlation by chance.
For all you nerds out there, we also go a step further. As you might 
remember, the regression coefficients for factors in a logistic regression 
dont quite directly translate to a change in probability. But with a handy 
little technique called Average Marginal Effects we can figure out how 
much an organization might gain from each factor. The well\-known adage 
correlation isnt causation still applies, but this approach effectively 
spotlights potentially useful practice\-outcome associations to consider.

Overall Program Success
Lets start by isolating the overall program success outcome because it encompasses 
all others. Figure 3 lists factors from top to bottom based on their strength of correlation 
with the respondent claiming to have a highly successful security program overall. The 
bars and values indicate the expected increase in probability of overall program success 
associated with each practice. Because of statistical variation, that increase is expressed 
as a range of probability. The middle value marks the average (and most likely) increase 
in the likelihood of program success.
According to these results, organizations wanting to maximize the overall success of 
their security program should ideally start with a modern, well\-integrated tech stack. 
Most respondents who said their firms tech refresh strategy emphasizes proactive 
refreshes using best\-of\-breed IT and security technologies are 11% to 15% more likely 
to report successful programs (12\.7% on average). Conversely, those who indicated 
that their firms rarely upgrade infrastructure or only do so when things break showed 
significantly reduced rates of success. Ensuring that technologies work well together as 
an integrated defense increases overall success by an average of about 11%.1
Figure 3: Practices most strongly correlated with overall security program success
We fully realize this finding seems suspiciously convenient for a company offering 
technologies fitting this description, so well take this opportunity to reiterate that 
a professional survey company (YouGov) conducted this survey, participants didnt 
know Cisco was involved, and an independent research firm (Cyentia Institute) 
analyzed the data. Were pleased these results validate Ciscos strategy and 
solutions portfolio, but we played no part in deriving them.

Figure 3 shows the change in probability of overall program success as a 
range. Read it like this: A proactive tech refresh strategy increases the chance 
of reporting a successful security program by roughly 11% to 15%, with an 
average of 12\.7%. Every chart like this can be interpreted in the same fashion.
1It should be noted that the probabilities associated with practice\-outcome combinations cannot be added together. So, 
we cannot say that proactive tech refreshes AND well\-integrated tech up the success rate by 23\.2% (12\.7% \+ 10\.5%). 
13
The 2021 Security Outcomes Study
Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program
We realize that a proactive tech refresh strategy isnt always that easy for some 
organizations. Some dont have the budget; some need to focus their resources and 
efforts elsewhere for various legitimate reasons. The good news is that these results 
DO NOT relegate such organizations to certain failure. It simply means they need to 
identify alternate success factors that work for their situation. Thats exactly what we 
hope this analysis helps them do. 
After all, having a sufficient security budget was one of the factors we tested, but it did 
not significantly correlate with overall program success. So good security isnt 
just about the money. Moving beyond the top two factors in Figure 3, its great to 
see measurable benefits tied to having a sound security strategy. Thats something 
organizations of all types and sizes can develop. Everything else flows from it.
Its often said that what makes great leaders is the way they respond to a crisis. 
Figure 3 says thats a big part of what makes a great security program too. A timely 
incident response requires thorough preparation, smart tools, and tested processes. 
If you need some justification to improve those capabilities, this chart should help. 
The next two success factors go hand\-in\-hand. Using performance metrics to drive 
operations, and then clearly reporting that information to executive leadership, contributes 
significantly to program success. This is the core of the OODA loop, and it works.
And that brings us to the last of the success factors IT, development, and security teams 
working together. No, we dont mean some kind of corporate retreat trust fall exercise 
while Imagine plays in the background. This factor points to the fact that you cant do 
security well if you cant do IT and development well (and vice versa). And if thats true, 
doesnt it make sense to communicate and collaborate so everyones more successful? 
Figure 3 shows theres a benefit to forging strong alliances across the organizational aisle.
One final thing to note is that the top overall success factors span all categories 
operations, governance, and strategy. This suggests that a great security program 
cant be built solely upon great governance or great strategy or great operations. 
A winning program requires all of these elements, and the more you do, the better 
you do. That theme will continue to reveal itself throughout the next few sections 
as we explore success factors for each of the 11 program\-level outcomes.
What appears to be a strong 
correlation between continually 
upgrading your tech and program 
success may spell bad news for 
organizations that use technology like 
furniture meaning it sticks around 
until it breaks. This indicates that 
newer is better isnt just a lifestyle 
choice spawned from Silicon Valley.

Meeting Security Objectives
Having a security program that is successful overall is a worthy goal, but its also 
perfectly reasonable (and often necessary) to pursue specific outcomes. Perhaps 
you looked at the list of outcomes in Table 1 and thought, I wonder what factors 
would help us achieve \[x outcome]? If so, this section is for you. 
Outcomes are organized into the three categories of: Enabling the Business, 
Managing Risk, and Operating Efficiently. Under those headings, we provide 
several security practices that correlate most strongly with respondents asserting 
their programs are successfully achieving each objective. Those wanting the full 
list of success factors for any given outcome should sit tight for just a bit; we have 
something special for you later in the report.
The four practices of Proactive tech refresh (SS6\), Well\-integrated tech 
(AO1\), Timely incident response (AO9\), and Prompt disaster recovery (AO10\) 
significantly contribute to nearly every outcome. Thus, theyre very common 
across all charts in this section. As a way of diversifying insights, we generally 
focus observations on the top five practices for each outcome besides those 
four. Please do not take that as us de\-emphasizing their importance. Theres 
a strong case that theyre THE most important success factors in this study. 
NIST CSF Functions
Beyond adherence to specific practices, we also asked respondents about 
where their security programs place the greatest priority in terms of investment, 
resources, and effort. We used the high\-level security functions defined in the 
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for this.
While the CSFs Protect function isnt at the bottom for every outcome, it ranks 
next to last for contributing to the overall success of the security program 
(Identify ranks \#1\). Thats certainly counterintuitive, but we dont see this as 
suggesting protection isnt important. Rather, it indicates that the best programs 
invest in a well\-rounded set of defenses to identify, protect, detect, respond, 
and recover from cyber threats. The field has long been protection\-heavy; this 
says that protection alone is not the most effective strategy.
Check out our \#SecurityOutcomes blog series to see how all five NIST CSF 
functions contribute to program outcomes.
Security buyers often have dozens 
of different tools from multiple 
vendors, and generally have to use 
a fair amount of duct tape to get 
them to work together. This creates 
complexity, cost, and overhead.

Enabling Business
As the label implies, outcomes in this section focus on the security programs 
mission of supporting and fostering business activities. This category recognizes that 
security doesnt exist for securitys sake; it serves the business. Lets see if we can 
find tips on how to accomplish that.
Keeping up with the demands and growth of the business
Frequently upgrading to the best available technologies and integrating them to 
work well together both feature prominently again in Figure 4\. Since weve already 
discussed those practices quite a bit, well simply note that this finding makes a 
lot of sense to us. The whole notion of keeping up with the business means that 
security must move, change, and adapt along with revenue\-generating activities. 
Anyone whos tried to teach old tech new tricks knows that its nearly impossible. 
Outdated, fragmented infrastructure hinders the business, period.
The strong link between role\-specific security training and enabling the business is 
music to our ears. In fact, we made it into a maxim: Adept people, agile program. 
Some might argue that this is one of the most fundamental themes in modern 
security programs. Effective training must be of high quality, consistent with the 
culture of the business, and tailored for specific audiences.
Figure 4: Top security success factors for keeping up with the business (EB1\)
The inclusion of automation in Figure 4 also makes sense to us. Automation helps 
the security program keep up with the business by eliminating bottlenecks and 
raising agility across people, processes, and technology. The emphasis on tech 
modernization, automation, and integration in Figure 4 starts to take on a distinctly 
DevSecOps appeal.
It may seem odd at first to see incident response (IR) listed as a top business 
enabler. But IR isnt just about putting out fires and cleaning up the mess. Its 
ultimately about handling unexpected events with minimal impact to the business. 
And in that light, it makes perfect sense that it makes the cut in Figure 4\.

Ostensibly, a metrics\-driven security program is one thats used to adjust course in 
response to changing conditions. We suspect thats why performance metrics make 
the list for helping security keep pace with the business. Theres no sense in moving 
quickly if youre not sure where you are or where youre going.
Its no surprise that having a sufficient budget helps the security program keep up 
with the business. This is worth remembering, especially if your business model 
involves moving fast and evolving quickly. Proper investments in security show 
promise for aiding that momentum.

Gaining the confidence and trust of executive leadership 
Score another point for modern, integrated tech. We cant help but think of executive 
SOC visits here (and have a sudden urge to clean our desk and look busy), but at least 
theres some evidence that the "tech tour" song and dance really does work!
Many C\-Suite executives view cybersecurity as insurance against landing their 
company in the headlines for a major breach or business interruption. Those fears 
may be why accurate threat detection and prompt disaster recovery rise high among 
factors that correlate with gaining executive confidence. Being able to demonstrate 
strong visibility and resilience communicates we got this to leadership.
Figure 5: Top security success factors for gaining executive confidence (EB2\)
Having an accurate asset inventory, program performance metrics, and role\-specific 
training seem to continue the theme of assuaging executives fears. Demonstrating 
that the security team knows where the crown jewels are located, has the skills to 
defend them, and tracks credible metrics to back up the we got this message 
goes a long way toward earning trust at the top. 
Security being important to execs and gaining their confidence seems rather 
tautological. This is probably a good example of the correlation isnt causation 
adage. If security is important to them, theyre likely supporting the program 
sufficiently and invested in its success.

Obtaining buy\-in from peers and other organizational units
Several of the top success factors in Figure 6 weve seen and discussed before. But 
its still helpful to see that good security operations (namely detection, integration, and 
automation) help earn respect and participation from other teamsdivisions. You could 
even argue that theyre dependent upon those other teams. These practices reduce 
friction, increase flexibility, and generally help the security program shed its stigma as 
the Department of No
.
Figure 6: Top security success factors for obtaining peer buy\-in (EB3\)
Speaking of stigmas, its not uncommon that security\-related spending hits the 
budgets of IT and development organizations (sometimes harder than theyd like). 
This may be why giving the security program a sufficient budget of its own helps 
with peer buy\-in. That same idea is likely why having adequate security staff makes 
the list. Oh, I dont have to pay for it or take my people away from what theyre 
doing? Then sure, well participate thanks!
Vulnerability remediation is a concrete example of the dynamic described in the previous 
paragraph. Its rarely done without collaboration between IT and security teams. Security 
often finds the bugs, while IT squashes them. Its easy to see why coordinating 
whos doing what engenders better cooperation among interdepartmental peers.

Creating a security culture embraced by all employees
How do you create a security culture thats actually embraced rather than eschewed by 
employees? Figure 7 places the following at the top of the list: giving them good tech 
that meets their needs, a clear sense of direction, and timely fixes when things break (or 
keeping them from breaking in the first place). Its hard to argue with that message.
Culture doesnt simply mean training, especially the annual online awareness kind that 
everyone hates. And it certainly doesnt mean every time you violate a security policy, 
well punish you by making you go through that training again. The strategy\-culture 
correlation is worth calling out specifically. This is the only outcome in the Enabling 
the Business category for which having a sound security strategy significantly 
increases the probability of success. That may seem odd, but consider that many 
a frustrated employee has asked something to the effect of why do we have to go 
through all of this? in response to new security policies. A good strategy eases that 
frustration by getting everyone on the same page.
Figure 7: Top success factors for creating a strong security culture (EB4\)
We saw earlier that IT, development, and security teams working together 
contributes to overall program success, and its no surprise to see that it benefits 
culture as well. You cant just impose security on the organization; it must be 
built into the fabric of the infrastructure and organization itself to really make a 
difference. Good collaboration among technical teams is essential to that goal.
The inclusion of manage vendor security in Figure 7 gave us pause. The full text 
of that question, however, offers some insight: Im confident that the security 
practices of vendors in my organizations valuesupply chain are in line with our 
standards OR that we manage them accordingly. We dont think its reading 
too far between the lines to infer that firms extending security across their entire 
supply chain are more likely to have it permeate their culture too.

Managing Risk
Managing risk is what most people think of when asked about the security programs 
primary responsibility. Of course, risk is multi\-faceted, which is why we chose 
to examine three outcomes that each provide a distinct perspective on how the 
organization manages risk.
Managing the top cyber risks to the organization
Theres a danger of reading too much into small details like the fact that prompt disaster 
recovery ranks above the tag team champions of refreshing and integrating tech in 
Figure 8\. But its possible the data sees something important here and wants to remind 
us that managing risk isnt just about keeping bad things from happening. Its equally 
important to minimize the impact when they inevitably do. And thats what prompt 
disaster recovery is all about.
This is one of only two outcomes for which having sufficient security tech and 
proactive refreshes both contribute significantly. We interpret that as the data 
doubling down on the message that the best tools in the best shape give the best 
chances of managing critical risks.
Figure 8: Leading security success factors for managing top risks (MR1\)
As long\-time proponents of security metrics, were glad to see that having a data\-
driven program improves the management of risk. The you cant manage what you 
cant measure quote is overused, but not without good reason. It holds true in so 
many domains, including cybersecurity.
We were genuinely surprised to see that this is the only outcome showing a strong 
correlation with a secure development approach for applications. But it makes sense 
since software flaws are inherent to so many cyber risks. 
This is also the first time clear reporting to execs plays a role, so it seems fitting to touch 
on that. Its doubtful that just reporting on the activities and effectiveness of the security 
program to leadership effectively reduces exposure to critical risks. That said, it does imply 
some level of oversight and accountability, which may act as a forcing function for the 
security program to walk the talk. Of course, we could be seeing the equivalent of a Jedi 
mind trick: Here are the assurances youre looking for; we can go about our business.

Meeting regulatory compliance requirements
Proactive tech refresh has become a permanent fixture in these charts, but its leading 
position for meeting compliance regulations is kind of a head scratcher. Do modern, 
best\-of\-breed solutions check a bunch of boxes or create a superb audit trail? Were 
not entirely sure, but its certainly something to note.
Several practices in Figure 9 could be viewed as go\-to evidence that the security 
program is covering its bases creating a sound strategy, remediating vulnerabilities 
on time, responding quickly to incidents, and swiftly recovering from major events. 
Ticking off those boxes goes a long way in remaining compliant.

Executives are keenly aware of legal and regulatory risks, which is why the topic is 
often front and center in board\-level security reporting. In reference to the inclusion 
of clear reporting to execs in this chart, perhaps security leaders that can clearly 
communicate the status and effectiveness of the security program to executives can 
likely do so for regulators as well. Or perhaps those very executives are better able 
to communicate with regulators, thus helping with compliance. 
We havent made it a practice of discussing practices that do NOT correlate with 
outcomes, but we just cant ignore this one. Having someone on staff who owns 
compliance was one of the factors we analyzed. But it didnt improve the chances 
of success for any outcome, including this one. Granted, just having a person with 
a compliance title isnt going to make the regulators happybut still. If it should 
contribute to any objective, it should be this one.
Avoiding major security incidents and losses
To us, Figure 10 proclaims a clear attackers are always innovating; we must also 
message. The ability to avoid major cybersecurity incidents and losses appears 
strongly dependent on maintaining modern, highly effective IT and security 
infrastructure backed by nimble response and recovery capabilities.
One of the side benefits of a proactive refresh strategy is that tech stacks are being 
touched regularly and not being left undocumented and out of date. The history 
of major breaches is replete with examples of organizations that overlooked, lost 
track of, or otherwise werent closely maintaining systems that allowed attackers 
to establish a foothold in their environment. Stagnant infrastructure makes it all too 
easy for bad actors to get comfy and stick around.

Speaking of breach history, Figure 10 says we shouldnt just be studying the big public 
incidents for clues on how to avoid them, but should also look at our own incidents (and 
near misses). A learning security culture that conducts after\-action reviews of major 
incidents and carries those lessons forward is better positioned to address future events. 
In addition to helping manage top cyber risks, it appears performance metrics also 
improve a security programs chances of dodging the breach bullet. Along with 
accurate threat detection, this combination provides holistic situational awareness. 
Knowing the adversaries capabilities and activities as well as that of your own 
defenses helps level the asymmetric nature of the playing field. 
Last but not least, role\-specific training adds to the programs ability to avoid major 
incidents and losses. To put this in proper perspective, the data shows that training 
is about as effective as threat detection for minimizing the risk of breaches. Now, 
which one of those gets more funding in your organization? Training is one of those 
things often put forth as necessary for success, yet its often one of the first things 
to go when budgets get tight. If you need evidence to convince your organizational 
leadership that its in their best interest to invest in their people, its in this chart. 
Spotlight on Major Incidents and Losses
Having a major security incident or data loss doesnt mean the security program 
is failing (nor does a lack of them prove success), but its certainly a top\-of\-mind 
metric for organizational leadership. We asked respondents who said their firms 
were struggling to avoid incidents to provide additional detail on those struggles. 
The most common types of security events reported were data breaches, 
ransomware, and service outages. 
We were also interested in learning about the impacts of those events. 
Operational impacts were most common, which makes sense because major 
events force people (and systems) to stop their normal business activities in 
response to the incident. Regulatory action comes in next, along with brand 
damage, harmed business relationships, lost revenue, and legal actions. Get 
more detail on incidents and losses in the \#SecurityOutcomes blog series.

Operating Efficiently
Beyond enabling the business and managing risk, the ability to operate efficiently often 
sets great security programs apart from the good ones. This last set of outcomes in 
our study addresses cost\-effectiveness, executing strategy, talent management, and 
IR processes. Important stuff, right? Lets see what can give your program the edge.
Running a cost\-effective security program
It initially seems counterintuitive that a proactive tech refresh strategy would contribute 
to maintaining a cost\-effective security program. But as weve said before, this practice 
isnt just about making it rain security Benjamins. Its a strategy that ensures your team 
has the best tools to help them perform to the best of their ability. And the next two 
practices in Figure 11 integration and automation are difficult to achieve if your 
security tools are not kept up to date. The best tools are more effective, easier to 
manage, and therefore less costly over the long run.
Weve also seen the next two practices in Figure 11 several times already. If youve ever 
gone through a major security incident, you know that an absurd amount of time and money 
can be spent during the response and recovery process. Ensuring those capabilities are 
primed and ready to fire when needed contains both the incident and associated costs.

Few tasks in security are more tedious than vulnerability management and triaging 
countless false\-positives. Its not without reason that these two functions sit at 
the bottom of Figure 2 among the least well\-implemented practices we examined. 
Theyre hard and consume a lot of resources. Thankfully, Figure 11 offers hope for the 
weary by showing that remediation deadlines and detection accuracy boost efficiency. 
Theres a Goldilocks zone for security budgets when it comes to this outcome. Too little, 
and you cant get everything done no matter how hard you try. Too big, and wastefulness 
tends to creep in. But when the budget is juuussst right, the programs capabilities fit the 
mission perfectly and operations run at maximum efficiency.
Overall, it appears that a cost\-effective security program is easiest to achieve with 
well\-designed architecture supported by efficient operations.

The 2021 Security Outcomes Study
Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program
Minimizing unplanned work and wasted effort
This outcome is similar to running a cost\-effective program, but is focused more on 
executing the strategy without major setbacks or deviations. It makes sense then that 
having a good strategy in the first place makes the top five practices correlated with 
this objective. Having a budget thats sufficient to enable that strategy helps a lot too.
Additional factors in the chart timely response, effective automation, and accurate 
threat detection offer a first\-mover advantage in the day\-to\-day execution of that 
strategy. Poor threat detection and response are particularly prone to rabbit holes. As 
mentioned before, a disjointed incident response process and chasing down endless 
false\-positives lead to wasted time, staff burnout, and a host of other value\-diminishing 
effects. The primary purpose of security automation and orchestration is to counteract 
operational dead\-ends and bottlenecks. Its good to have validation that it does indeed 
accomplish that purpose.
Also important for achieving this objective, performance metrics can force hard 
questions about the direction of the security program and provide instrumentation to 
determine when its veering off course.
Figure 12: Top security success factors for minimizing wasted effort (OP2\)
Recruiting and retaining talented security personnel
Theres a lot of talk in the industry about the difficulties of recruiting and retaining 
security staff. Heres a formula that might help: have the budget to hire top talent, 
develop a strategy that makes sense to them, surround them with good peers, 
and give them the tools they need to succeed. Diversity in your talent, and their 
backgrounds, skills, and opinions is essential to create a culture where your staff 
feels included, respected, and ready to grow their careers.
To be honest, the tech\-heavy nature of the practices listed in Figure 13 caused us to do 
a double take. We expected to see a somewhat softer list of success factors. But as it 
often does, the data urged us to reconsider our presuppositions. After doing that, we 
concede that it makes good sense that architecture and operations play an important 
role in attracting and keeping top security staff. Absolutely no one enjoys wasting 
their time and talents overcoming bad tech.

Figure 13: Top success factors for retaining security talent (OP3\)
Regarding wasted time and talents, security automation is worth calling out here. Some 
position automation as a replacement for people, but those who know how to use it 
effectively understand that it relieves rather than replaces talent. Relieving staff from 
mundane tasks frees them up for more challenging, enjoyable, and valuable work. And 
these results indicate that security professionals appreciate that.
IT and security teams working together is another factor that deserves mention. 
A culture of collaboration isnt easy to build, but its worth it for so many reasons. 
Figure 13 adds talent retention to that stack of justifications.
Streamlining incident detection and response
This final outcome is more tactical than many of the others and, at least as far as 
the label goes, overlaps with the timely incident response practice. Reviewing the 
description and example evidence for this objective in Appendix B, however, clarifies 
that streamlined IR can be an end as well as a means. And as prominently as IR, threat 
detection, and other core SecOps practices factor into the outcomes presented in this 
section, its reasonable to wonder how we can improve those capabilities.

Figure 14: Top security success factors for streamlining IR processes (OP4\)
Part of the answer is the same one thats been reinforced so often in this study: modern, 
well\-tuned security architecture supported by mature operations. Were ready to call that 
table stakes by this point. Were more interested in what ups the ante for a winning hand, 
as revealed by the last three factors in Figure 14\. Weve seen the value of learning from 
prior incidents once before (for avoiding major incidents and losses), and its good to see 
it pop up again here. While it seems obvious, youd be surprised how many IR teams dont 
take the time to really do this. This is also only the second outcome for which having an 
accurate asset inventory serves as a key success factor. Having heard we didnt 
even know that (compromised) server was still around and were not sure where that 
application lives a time or two, this correlation makes perfect sense. Its hard to respond 
well when you dont know where assets sit, who owns them, how theyre configured, etc. 
Streamlining IR processes isnt what typically comes to mind when seeking to justify 
adoption of a secure development lifecycle. But this practice implies better integration 
between security and development teamsprocesses through DevSecOps. This, in turn, 
leads to more robust and resilient applications, better shared understanding of the attack 
surface, and greater awareness of flaws and how to address them when issues arise.
Curtailing the impact of COVID\-19
We asked participants about how the COVID\-19 pandemic impacted their organizations, 
which could be viewed as another outcome in the Operating Efficiently grouping. 
Firms that were most successful in minimizing the impact of COVID\-19 on their 
operations and cyber risk posture had the following characteristics:
1\. They had a proactive tech refresh strategy emphasizing frequent upgrades to 
best\-of\-breed IT and security technologies.
1\. They had adequate security staffing levels and invested in their people through 
role\-based training programs.
1\. They kept top executives informed through clear reporting on the activities and 
effectiveness of the security program.
We interpret these results to suggest that an organizations ability to maintain 
resiliency through unexpected events like the COVID\-19 pandemic is strongly 
dependent upon a modern, high\-performance tech stack maintained by capable 
personnel with strong accountability from organizational leadership. See what else we 
discovered about this important topic in the \#SecurityOutcomes blog series.

As a crisis, COVID\-19 has 
undoubtedly created additional 
security threats as the workforce 
spends more time working in 
unusual circumstances. We needed 
to do three major things: equip staff 
and students with the appropriate 
work tools, overlay sensible security 
measures, and train the workforce 
on the threats and then message 
those threats again and again. 
Engagement was key a gentle drip,drip of solid and sensible advice to

A Roadmap for Success
Earlier in this study, we urged those wanting to see beyond the top success factors 
to hold that thought and wed circle back to it. Heres where we make good on that 
promise. Figure 15 displays all security practices discussed in this report along the 
bottom and all program\-level outcomes on the left side. See the Appendix for the 
full question text for both practices and outcomes.
Colored squares indicate a statistically significant positive correlation between 
the intersecting practice and outcome (white squares mean no correlation). 
The intensity of shading indicates the average increase in probability of success 
for each practice\-to\-outcome combination. The values underlying the shading 
correspond to those shown in the preceding charts.
Rather than include a bunch of recommendations from us, we thought wed 
conclude the report the same way we started it by letting the data speak for itself. 
We designed this chart to help you visualize the big picture and begin to build an 
evidence\-based roadmap to a more successful security program. Its the ultimate 
Choose Your Own Security Adventure.
Heres a couple tips for planning
that journey:
Focus on individual rows if youd like to identify practices 
that the data suggests can help your program achieve 
particular outcomes. 
Focus on individual columns if youd like to see the potential 
benefits to your program (outcomes) associated with a 
particular practice.
Note that some practices have a broad influence on many 
outcomes, while others offer more narrow or specific benefits.

Blank squares in Figure 15 dont necessarily mean the practice in question

The 2021 Security Outcomes Study
Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program
Appendix B: Full Listing of Security Outcomes
Enabling Business
EB1
Keeping up with the demands and growth of the business
Example and Evidence of Success: The security program responds well to changing 
business needs and doesn't impede new lines of revenue. In some cases, security may 
provide competitive advantage or even be a net revenue generator. If security is viewed 
purely as a cost center or the Department of No! by business execs, its a sign of 
struggling to meet this goal.
EB2
Gaining the confidence and trust of executive leadership
Example and Evidence of Success: Security leaders meet regularly \- and favorably \- with 
top executives and the Board of Directors. The relationship between business and security 
leaders is one of mutual respect and collaboration. If security is often in the hot seat with 
executives or regularly denied reasonable requests for support, its a sign of struggling to 
meet this goal.
EB3
Obtaining buy\-in from peers and other organizational units
Example and Evidence of Success: Security enlists other divisions in building a cooperative 
defense of the organization. Communication and collaboration is strong with a fair sense of 
give and take for the greater good. Non\-security leaders or divisions may have security\-
related performance measures. A culture of inter\-departmental complaints and contention 
is a sign of struggling to meet this goal.
EB4
Creating a security culture embraced by all employees
Example and Evidence of Success: Employees are treated as part of the security solution 
rather than the problem. Security isnt a negative theme in employee satisfaction surveys or 
exit interviews. Non\-security staff regularly report phishing attempts, potential malware, and 
other incidents. Frequent security policy violations and workarounds are a sign of struggling 
to meet this goal.
Managing Risk
MR1
Managing the top cyber risks to the organization
Example and Evidence of Success: Top risk scenarios have been agreed upon by 
executives and security leaders and mitigation plans exist for those risks (or they've been 
accepted). Potential cyber risk exposure is currently within the risk appetite established by 
leadership. Theres no evidence that risk management capabilities are failing (e.g frequent 
near misses, control deviations, responserecovery testing failures, etc.).
MR2
Meeting regulatory compliance requirements
Example and Evidence of Success: Theres an absence of avoidable security findings from 
auditors and regulators. The organization is diligently tracking and addressing changing 
regulatory requirements. Theres evidence that the organization understands whats required, 
acknowledges any findings and deficiencies, and is spendingworking to mitigate them.
MR3
Avoiding major security incidents and losses
Example and Evidence of Success: We expect that an organization thats highly successful 
in achieving this goal has not had a major security incident (of high internal andor external 
visibility) in the last couple years. Furthermore, theres no reason to suspect that its merely 
a matter of time until a major data loss event occurs. Minor and even moderate incidents 
are expected, but the question here is whether the organization has and will continue to 
stay out of the headlines.

Poised for Success: Proven Factors for Your Security Program
Operating Efficiently
OP1
Running a cost\-effective security program
Example and Evidence of Success: Executive leaders view the security program as having 
a good return on investment (ROI). There are no recurring rumblings about the overly high 
costs of security. Theres a low rate of shelfware purchases. Staffing is lean but sufficient. 
A plan among executives and security leaders to reduce the security budget without 
increasing risk would be a good sign of success here.
OP2
Minimizing unplanned work and wasted effort
Example and Evidence of Success: Strategy execution proceeds without frequent setbacks 
and deviations. Security budget is spent proactively rather than reactively. Employees spend 
their time on higher\-level, more valuable tasks rather than being mired in the mundane. 
Constant firefighting mode or a program that cant get out of its own way is a sign of 
struggling to meet this goal.
OP3
Recruiting and retaining talented security personnel
Example and Evidence of Success: The organization has a positive reputation in the 
security community as being a good place to work. Open security positions are generally 
filled quickly and without undue incentives. Talented staff move up instead of move out and 
attrition rates remain low. Employee satisfaction is consistently high.
OP4
Streamlining incident detection and response processes
Example and Evidence of Success: Theres a general sense that security operations 
run efficiently. Triaging security events isnt a guessing game and doesnt take forever. 
Responding to and remediating incidents is well\-organized rather than chaotic. Metrics like 
time\-to\-detection and time\-to\-remediation are tracked and are trending down over time.
