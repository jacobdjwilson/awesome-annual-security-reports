## Executive Summary

Welcome to the 2020 FireEye Cyber Trendscape report.

In 2019, FireEye worked with KANTAR, an independent market research organization to perform a large-scale cyber
security research initiative involving over 800 senior executives from North America (U.S. and Canada), Europe (France,
Germany and the UK) and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).

The goal of this initiative was to identify trends impacting cyber security decisions, the top cyber security priorities for
2020 and beyond, the focus of risk mitigation strategies, and to highlight the overall beliefs and perceptions held by
senior executives regarding the state of the cyber threat landscape and how the cyber security industry, governments
and regulatory agencies are responding to their needs.

The study highlights five cyber security focus areas within organizations:

*   The cyber threat landscape
*   Top cyber security program initiatives and overall maturity
*   Balancing the needs of business operations and ensuring resilience to cyber threats
*   Supporting security operations
*   Driving cyber security efficiency

The report provides direct insights that will help organizations benchmark their cyber security initiatives, offers data
points on leading issues that can be used to support critical decision making and provides context for discussions with
senior leadership, board members and other key stakeholders.

## Key Findings

While the findings include regional nuances, representatives from participating organizations were remarkably consistent
in their views and perspectives of cyber security. Also, different attitudes appeared to influence how individuals and
organizations approach cyber security across the world.

### Cyber Environments

Over 90% of organizations believe cyber threats will
stay the same or worsen in 2020 and the top three
industry sectors believed to be the most likely
targets of a cyber attack are finance and banking,
technology and government.

The biggest concerns for organizations during a
cyber attack or breach event are loss of sensitive
data, impacts to customers and business operation
disruptions.

### Security Approaches

Finding a balance between cyber security and
operational requirements is a challenge for 63% of
organizations.

In the US, 51% of organizations believe cloud is more
secure than their on-premise environment however
globally, 60% of organizations prefer an on-premise
email system to cloud-based.

Globally, 88% of organizations have active initiatives
related to the use of artificial intelligence and 86%
have active initiatives on the use of block chain.

### Plans and Preparation

Globally, 51% of organizations do not believe they are
ready or would respond well to a cyber attack or breach
event. Nearly 29% of organizations who have cyber
attack and breach response plans have not tested or
updated their plans in 12 or more months. Over 40% of
organizations do not have or have only very limited as-
needed cyber security training for their employees.

While 91% of organization currently have or are planning
to obtain cyber security insurance in the next 18 months,
56% of organizations who currently have cyber security
insurance thought it difficult to find and overall
expressed concerns over the value it provided.

Nearly 60% of organizations globally do not have a
security information and event manager (SIEM) within
their environments.

The average staffing of a security operations center
(SOC) is 11-30 people and 60% of organizations who
have a SOC are planning to grow this staffing level over
the next 18 months. Germany has over 250% more
organizations that do not have a SOC than the global
average.

### Financial and Personnel Considerations

Over 72% of organizations consider the cost of cyber
security to be reasonable or inexpensive for the value
it provides.

To help better address their cyber security needs,
76% of organizations are planning cyber security
budget increases for 2020 with most indicating
planned increases of 1-9% over the current 2019
cyber security budget which, on average, is
equivalent to 6-7% of the overall IT budget.

### Views on Attacks

Organizations believe the most likely attribution for the
attacks they experienced over the past 12 months are
hacker groups, individual hackers and criminal
organizations. Globally, nation states were considered
the least likely source of cyber attacks. Only in South
Korea were they considered one of the top three most
likely sources.

## Methodology and Participants

This research study was commissioned by FireEye and delivered
by KANTAR, an independent market research organization. The
results were derived from an online survey fielded in July and
August of 2019 for a total of over 800 responses spanning across
North America (US and Canada), Europe (France, Germany and
the UK) and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).

Setup questions were used to ensure that only cyber security
executives were in the sample. The findings represent the views
from three senior organizational roles with 45% of participants at
C-level an above, 17% at the vice president level and 38% at the
senior director level. The participants were 68% men and 32%
women. Canada had the largest percentage of women
participants (42%).

 Higher education was universally valued with 46% of all
participants possessing university degrees and a further 34%
indicating they had also completed graduate studies.

![Participant role in their organization.](Image description)
Figure 1. Participant role in their organization.

### Line of Business and Industry Sector

Globally, 53% of participants reported into the IT organization, 20% reported to business operations, 13% to finance, 11% to
a dedicated cyber security function and 4% to legal.

In the U.S. the breakdown was more pronounced with 78% reporting to IT, 10% to business operations, 6% to finance, 4%
to cyber security and 2% to legal.

### Organizational Structure

Sixty-two percent of participants reported that their organizations had a formal CIO or similar role, while others reported
a CISO/CSO role (50%), chief compliance officer (34%), chief risk officer (26%), chief privacy officer (24%) and general
counsel (20%).

The regions with the highest presence of chief compliance officers or similar roles were the UK (43%), France (41%), the
U.S. (40%) and China (38%).

Analyst Observation

While the reporting of industries
and size of the participating
organizations in Japan and
Germany were consistent with
global data, and thus not
creating a bias in the survey in
these countries towards the
concerns, issues or operations of
a particular type of organization,
14% of participants from Japan
and 12% from Germany reported
that their organizations lacked
any of the formal roles identified
in the study, contrasting sharply
with an average of less than 3%
for similar responses from each
of the other regions.

## Assessing and Addressing Cyber Risks

Organizations were asked to provide their assessment of the 2020
cyber security threat landscape and their plans for addressing cyber
risks. This included insights into:

*   Their cyber security budgets and the focus of their risk
mitigation strategies.
*   Their assessment of the performance and value of cyber
security solutions and of government and regulatory agencies.
*   The most likely and most vulnerable targets of cyber attacks.
*   The most likely source of cyber attacks they experienced over
the past 12 months.

The overall perception of the outlook for cyber risks in 2020 by global
participants was grim with 56% believing that it would worsen over
the next 12 months and 33% were of the opinion it would stay the
same. The most pessimistic participant views were from U.S. (74%)
and Japan (72%) where risks from cyber threats were expected to
worsen over the next 12 months.

![Understanding and defending
against cyber threats.](Image description)
Figure 6. Understanding and defending
against cyber threats.

Participants also believed that cyber threats were becoming more
difficult to understand and defend against. Responses 4 and 5 (“more difficult”) accounted on average a total of 70% of
responses globally. However, in Canada and Korea, 84% of respondents chose responses 4 and 5, signaling increased
concerns in these countries over the evolving complexity of the cyber threat landscape.

### Balancing Cyber Security and Operations

Organizations universally reported that it was more difficult to find
a balance between cyber security and operational requirements
with 14% reporting it to be very difficult and 49% difficult. Only 14%
of organizations found it easy and 3% found it easier to find a
balance. Globally, 18% of organizations were neutral on the issue.

Participants from Japan reported that 54% of their organizations
found it difficult and 18% very difficult to find a balance between
cyber security and operational requirements as did organizations in
Germany with 53% reporting difficult and 13% more difficult.

In France, 26% of organizations reported that it was neither easier
nor more difficult than before to find a balance between cyber
security and operations requirements.

There were no significant regional differences for organizations that
indicated it was easy or easier to find a balance between security
and operations; they corresponded closely to global results.

## Cyber Security Budgets

When planning to protect themselves against the cyber threat landscape, 78% of organizations reported security
budgets that were over 6% of the overall IT budget. The largest concentration of responses accounted for 37% of the
total and identified security budgets in the 6-7% range.

![Current size of security budget as a percentage of the overall IT budget.](Image description)

Japan

Analyst Observation

In the US, 25% of participants indicated
they had security budgets representing
a greater than a 10% share of the overall
IT budget. The largest security budgets
outside of the US were identified in
China (19%) and France (16%).

Japan was the most frugal in terms of
security budgets with 22% of
organizations reporting a spend of only
between 1-3% of the overall IT budget.
This is notable, considering that 72% of
organizations in Japan perceived the
risks from cyber threats worsening over
the next 12 months.

Globally, 76% of organizations reported planning net security budget increases in 2020. In the U.S., 39% of participants
were planning security budget increases of 10% or more compared with the UK (30%), Korea (22%), China (17%), France
(17%) and Canada (13%).

![Planned budget change for 2020.](Image description)
Figure 9. Planned budget change for 2020.

In Japan and Korea, a full 25% of organizations were planning to keep their 2020 security spend at the same level as 2019
compared with a global average of 13%.

The only countries where organizations were planning to decrease their security budget by more than 10% were France
(3%), Japan (3%), Korea (2%) and China (1%).

Globally, organizations allocated their cyber security budgets into four main categories: prevention (42%), detection
(28%), containment (16%) and remediation (14%).

Japan was the only country that changed the order slightly with an emphasis on detection being expressed by 40% of
organizations followed by prevention (35%), containment (13%) and remediation (12%).

## Value of Cyber Security Solutions, Government and
Regulatory Agencies

Organizations broadly (57%) believed that the cost of cyber security was reasonable for the value it provides. A further
25% believed it was inexpensive. Countries perceiving cyber security as inexpensive for the value it provides were Canada
(42%) and the UK (38%).

Participants in Japan (29%) and the U.S. (28%) believed cyber security was expensive for the benefits it provides.

![Value of cyber security spend for value provided.](Image description)
Figure 10. Value of cyber security spend for value provided.

Participants offered a mixed view, nearly equally positive and negative, in their
assessment of technology providers and cyber security vendors, and how well they
were protecting their environment.

Only 8% believed that technology providers and cyber security vendors were doing a
very good job of protecting their environments which is similarly low to the 6%
assessment for a very bad rating. Nearly matching results were also obtained for
good with 34% and bad with 30%. Lastly 22% of organizations did not favor a net
positive or negative assessment.

Organizations were slightly more positive in their assessment of governments and
regulatory agencies and how well they were doing at protecting their environments.

A majority of participants believed governments and regulatory agencies were doing
a good job (42%) or a very good job (11%). A neutral rating was provided by 19%
of global respondents. Of the remaining organizations 23% believed governments
and regulatory agencies were doing a bad job and 4% a very bad job.

Analyst Observation

The U.S. expressed the highest
rate of the most negative views
of governments and regulatory
agencies with very bad
gathering over 15% of the
views. The U.S. response for
bad was in line with other
regions (21%).

China expressed the most
negative perception overall
with 41% reporting a bad job
4% reporting a very bad job.

The most positive perceptions
were from Japan with 54%
good 10% very good followed
by the UK with 49% good and
15% very good.

Analyst Observation

Korea expressed the most positive
assessment of vendors with 35%
reporting good and 14% reporting
very good. In contrast, the U.S.
had 36% reporting bad and 15%
very bad. Japan had the highest
neutral assessment with 30% of
participants not favoring a net
positive or negative assessment.

## Cyber Attacks

Over 90% of organizations believe cyber threats will stay the same or worsen in 2020.

![Expected change in cyber threats for 2020.](Image description)
Figure 12. Expected change in cyber threats for 2020.

Participants believe that the top three industry sectors most likely to be targeted by cyber attacks are finance and
banking (20%), followed by technology (16%) and government (10%).

These results were consistent across nearly all countries represented with only a modest change in emphasis between
them as to which was first and second. The exception was China, where participants believe finance and banking would
be the most likely target, followed by industrial and manufacturing.

Participants were asked to identify the top three components they believed to be the most likely to be targeted by cyber
attacks and which top three components they believed were the most likely to be vulnerable to a cyber attack.

Participants were globally consistent in their belief that servers and server operating systems, web servers, medical
devices and endpoints were the top three components in both categories.

Similar findings were reported regarding the types of cyber attacks that participant organizations had experienced over
the last 12 months.

Globally, 93% of organizations reported some form of successful cyber attack in the past 12 months. Fifteen percent of
organizations in Japan (more than double the global average of 7%) indicated that they had not experienced a successful
cyber attack in the past 12 months.

## Source of Attacks

Organizations were asked to identify the most likely source of attacks against their organizations. Globally, the results
were highly consistent across all countries with hacker groups (31%), individual hackers (18%) and criminal organizations
(17%) coming in as the top three suspects.

Participants in Japan (25%) and Germany (23%) believed the most likely source of cyber attacks were
criminal organizations.

Globally, nation states were considered the least likely source of cyber attacks totaling less than 8% of responses.
Only in South Korea did it make the top three most likely source with over 19% of responses.

## Organizational Maturity and Resilience to
## Cyber Threats

Many factors impact the maturity of an organization’s cyber security program and its ability to be resilient against
cyber threats.

Participants were asked to provide their insights into the formative elements of their own cyber security program,
how the program was developed and how effective their organization was at responding to and addressing cyber
security issues.

Participants were also asked to describe their internal challenges to maturing their cyber security program and their
biggest fears in the event of a breach.

### Security Program Maturity

When assessing their cyber security programs, 27% of participants characterized them as semi-formal approaches where
efforts were mostly compliance-driven and focused on addressing mandatory regulations, while 24% saw their programs
as informal where the primary focus was addressing critical issues as they occurred.

Globally, 23% of organizations reported formal security programs with a broad, risk-based focus supporting continuous
optimization of processes and approaches, compared to the U.S. (41%) and China (38%).

Only 19% of organizations identified their security program as strategic with intelligence data driving investment
decisions, operational priorities and other critical cyber security factors.

Overall, 7% of organizations indicated they did not have a cyber security program at all. In Canada, this response
jumped to 18%.

## Cyber Attack and Breach Response Plans

Cyber attack and breach event response plans are critical for ensuring organizational focus and resilience during a cyber
security event.

These plans consist of pre-established and agreed upon actions, procedures, communications and leadership structure
invoked in the event of a cyber incident. To minimize delays and distractions, plans also include legal agreements and
pre-negotiated contracts with all third-parties that might augment operations or render assistance during an event.

Among all organizations excluding those from the U.S., 29% indicated the existence of mature cyber attack and breach
event response and communications plans that are regularly reviewed and updated. The highest results were from the
U.S. (62%) and China (39%).

However, 29% of organizations reported that while they had cyber plans, they had not been tested or updated in 12 or
more months.

Over 30% of organizations indicated that cyber attack and breach event response plans were owned and maintained by
individual businesses or applications and that they were not coordinated within an overall organization-wide plan.

While only 8% of organizations did not have any cyber attack and breach event response plans, the results were higher in
Canada (19%) and Japan (15%).

Organizations universally identified the chief information officer (CIO) as the
leading representative involved in the development or review of the cyber attack
or breach response plan, followed by the chief compliance officer (CCO), IT
security and finally IT operations staff (Fig. 20).

Analyst Observation

Overall, internal and external legal
counsel were identified as among the
roles least involved in the
development of plans (Fig. 20). This
is in sharp contrast to recommended
industry best practices, given that
the main focus of legal counsel is to
protect the organization from and
minimize its exposure to risks. Legal
counsel provides guidance on the
acceptable levels of risks and
obligations for their organization and
ensures that legal frameworks are
adhered to before, during and after a
cyber attack or breach event to
mitigate further impact.

Line of business and business
operations were consistently and
universally identified as the least
involved in the development and
review of plans. This is notable
because these groups are considered
critical stakeholders in plans
presumably designed to maintain
business operations during an event.

## Organizational Readiness Against a Cyber Attack or Breach Event

When asked how they would rate their
organization’s readiness to address a cyber
attack or breach event, the respondents
were nearly equally split. Forty-nine percent
considered their organization to be fully
ready with the ability to respond well and
47% indicated that some portions of their
organization would be ready, but overall
they would struggle to respond well. In the
U.S., 72% of respondents were confident in
their organization’s readiness to respond
well to a cyber attack or breach incident,
sharply contrasting with Japan (24%).

Fourteen percent of organizations in Japan
believed they were not ready and would
not respond well to a cyber attack or
breach event, which is significantly higher
than the global average (just over 2%,
excluding responses from Japan).

Solutions deployed to protect organizations from cyber attacks range in capability, applicable scope and cost to acquire
and maintain. Organizations were asked which solutions they currently deployed in their organization, which components
they believed provided the best protection and where they would focus future investments if they had unlimited
budgets.

Globally, participants were quite consistent when they identified the components that currently contributed the most
positive impact to their organization’s ability to prevent a cyber attack or breach. Specifically, vulnerability management
had an edge over security software (both slightly above 16%). These were followed by employee training (14%) and then
response plans and security hardware (both slightly above 12%).

Organizations were then asked which component they believed would most positively impact
their organization’s ability to prevent a cyber attack or breach if they had the opportunity to
dramatically increase its the budget or presence.

The results were globally consistent: 15% of organizations believed that increasing the
investment and presence of vulnerability management solutions within their environment
would generate the most impactful results, followed by threat intelligence (13.7%), threat
hunting (12.6%) and employee training (12%).

Analyst Observation

Organizations in France
believed employee
training was the cyber
security investment area
with the highest potential
positive impact against a
cyber attack. Their
response was 67% higher
than the global average
(excluding France).

Looking more deeply into employee cyber security awareness training (Fig. 25):

*   35% of organizations had semi-formal training conducted at regular intervals that addressed compliance and
    typical cyber security awareness topics.
*   29% of organizations had informal training programs focused on meeting core compliance requirements that are
    conducted on an as-needed basis
*   25% had advanced training programs designed to promote broad cyber security awareness and behavioral
    changes through regular mandatory training and evaluation.
*   Over 11% of organizations had no internal employee cyber security training programs.

Analyst Observation

Less than 1% of organizations
in France indicated they did
not have any cyber security
training programs, the lowest
rate among all countries
included in this study. This
stands in stark contrast to the
responses in Germany (25%)
and Canada (23%) where no
security training program was
in place.

Significant presence of
advanced cyber security
training programs was
reported in the U.S. (48%), UK
(34%) and China (37%).

Organizations consistently reported their greatest concern regarding a cyber attack or breach event as the loss of
sensitive data, followed by customers and business operation disruption.

In the U.S. the greatest concern was business operations disruption. U.S. organizations were least concerned by the
possibility of physical damage to real-world infrastructure.
