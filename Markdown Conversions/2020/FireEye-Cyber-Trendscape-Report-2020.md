security research initiative involving over 800 senior executives from North America (U.S. and Canada), Europe (France, 
Germany and the UK) and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).The goal of this initiative was to identify trends impacting cyber security decisions, the top cyber security priorities for 
2020 and beyond, the focus of risk mitigation strategies, and to highlight the overall beliefs and perceptions held by 
senior executives regarding the state of the cyber threat landscape and how the cyber security industry, governments 
and regulatory agencies are responding to their needs.The study highlights five cyber security focus areas within organizations:The cyber threat landscapeTop cyber security program initiatives and overall maturityBalancing the needs of business operations and ensuring resilience to cyber threatsSupporting security operationsDriving cyber security efficiencyThe report provides direct insights that will help organizations benchmark their cyber security initiatives, offers data 
points on leading issues that can be used to support critical decision making and provides context for discussions with 
senior leadership, board members and other key stakeholders.REPORT \| CYBER TRENDSCAPE 20204Key FindingsWhile the findings include regional nuances, representatives from participating organizations were remarkably consistent 
in their views and perspectives of cyber security. Also, different attitudes appeared to influence how individuals and 
organizations approach cyber security across the world.Cyber EnvironmentsOver 90% of organizations believe cyber threats will 
stay the same or worsen in 2020 and the top three 
industry sectors believed to be the most likely 
targets of a cyber attack are finance and banking, 
technology and government.The biggest concerns for organizations during a 
cyber attack or breach event are loss of sensitive 
data, impacts to customers and business operation 
disruptions.Financial ConsiderationsOver 72% of organizations consider the cost of cyber 
security to be reasonable or inexpensive for the value 
it provides.To help better address their cyber security needs, 
76% of organizations are planning cyber security 
budget increases for 2020 with most indicating 
planned increases of 1\-9% over the current 2019 
cyber security budget which, on average, is 
equivalent to 6\-7% of the overall IT budget.Security ApproachesFinding a balance between cyber security and 
operational requirements is a challenge for 63% of 
organizations.In the US, 51% of organizations believe cloud is more 
secure than their on\-premise environment however 
globally, 60% of organizations prefer an on\-premise 
email system to cloud\-based.Globally, 88% of organizations have active initiatives 
related to the use of artificial intelligence and 86% 
have active initiatives on the use of block chain.Preparation and StaffingGlobally, 51% of organizations do not believe they are 
ready or would respond well to a cyber attack or breach 
event. Nearly 29% of organizations who have cyber 
attack and breach response plans have not tested or 
updated their plans in 12 or more months. Over 40% of 
organizations do not have or have only very limited as\-
needed cyber security training for their employees.While 91% of organization currently have or are planning 
to obtain cyber security insurance in the next 18 months, 
56% of organizations who currently have cyber security 
insurance thought it difficult to find and overall 
expressed concerns over the value it provided.Nearly 60% of organizations globally do not have a 
security information and event manager (SIEM) within 
their environments.The average staffing of a security operations center 
(SOC) is 11\-30 people and 60% of organizations who 
have a SOC are planning to grow this staffing level over 
the next 18 months. Germany has over 250% more 
organizations that do not have a SOC than the global 
average.Views on AttacksOrganizations believe the most likely attribution for the 
attacks they experienced over the past 12 months are 
hacker groups, individual hackers and criminal 
organizations. Globally, nation states were considered 
the least likely source of cyber attacks. Only in South 
Korea were they considered one of the top three most 
likely sources.REPORT \| CYBER TRENDSCAPE 20205Methodology and ParticipantsThis research study was commissioned by FireEye and delivered 
by KANTAR, an independent market research organization. The 
results were derived from an online survey fielded in July and 
August of 2019 for a total of over 800 responses spanning across 
North America (US and Canada), Europe (France, Germany and 
the UK) and Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).Setup questions were used to ensure that only cyber security 
executives were in the sample. The findings represent the views 
from three senior organizational roles with 45% of participants at 
C\-level an above, 17% at the vice president level and 38% at the 
senior director level. The participants were 68% men and 32% 
women. Canada had the largest percentage of women 
participants (42%). Higher education was universally valued with 46% of all 
participants possessing university degrees and a further 34% 
indicating they had also completed graduate studies.Senior Director

and size of the participating 
organizations in Japan and 
Germany were consistent with 
global data, and thus not 
creating a bias in the survey in 
these countries towards the 
concerns, issues or operations of 
a particular type of organization, 
14% of participants from Japan 
and 12% from Germany reported 
that their organizations lacked 
any of the formal roles identified 
in the study, contrasting sharply 
with an average of less than 3% 
for similar responses from each 
of the other regions.REPORT \| CYBER TRENDSCAPE 20207Assessing and Addressing Cyber RisksOrganizations were asked to provide their assessment of the 2020 
cyber security threat landscape and their plans for addressing cyber 
risks. This included insights into:Their cyber security budgets and the focus of their riskmitigation strategies.Their assessment of the performance and value of cybersecurity solutions and of government and regulatory agencies.The most likely and most vulnerable targets of cyber attacks.The most likely source of cyber attacks they experienced overthe past 12 months.The overall perception of the outlook for cyber risks in 2020 by global 
participants was grim with 56% believing that it would worsen over 
the next 12 months and 33% were of the opinion it would stay the 
same. The most pessimistic participant views were from U.S. (74%) 
and Japan (72%) where risks from cyber threats were expected to 
worsen over the next 12 months.80604020012345EasierMore DifficultFigure 6\. Understanding and defending 
against cyber threats.Participants also believed that cyber threats were becoming more 
difficult to understand and defend against. Responses 4 and 5 (more difficult) accounted on average a total of 70% of 
responses globally. However, in Canada and Korea, 84% of respondents chose responses 4 and 5, signaling increased 
concerns in these countries over the evolving complexity of the cyber threat landscape.Balancing Cyber Security and OperationsOrganizations universally reported that it was more difficult to find 
a balance between cyber security and operational requirements 
with 14% reporting it to be very difficult and 49% difficult. Only 14% 
of organizations found it easy and 3% found it easier to find a 
balance. Globally, 18% of organizations were neutral on the issue.Participants from Japan reported that 54% of their organizations 
found it difficult and 18% very difficult to find a balance between 
cyber security and operational requirements as did organizations in 
Germany with 53% reporting difficult and 13% more difficult.In France, 26% of organizations reported that it was neither easier 
nor more difficult than before to find a balance between cyber 
security and operations requirements.There were no significant regional differences for organizations that 
indicated it was easy or easier to find a balance between security 
and operations; they corresponded closely to global results.s

budgets that were over 6% of the overall IT budget. The largest concentration of responses accounted for 37% of the 
total and identified security budgets in the 6\-7% range.Above 10%8\-10%6\-7%4\-5%1\-3%0510152025303540GlobalJapanFigure 8\. Current size of security budget as a percentage of the overall IT budget.Analyst ObservationIn the US, 25% of participants indicated 
they had security budgets representing 
a greater than a 10% share of the overall 
IT budget. The largest security budgets 
outside of the US were identified in 
China (19%) and France (16%).Japan was the most frugal in terms of 
security budgets with 22% of 
organizations reporting a spend of only 
between 1\-3% of the overall IT budget. 
This is notable, considering that 72% of 
organizations in Japan perceived the 
risks from cyber threats worsening over 
the next 12 months.Globally, 76% of organizations reported planning net security budget increases in 2020\. In the U.S 39% of participants 
were planning security budget increases of 10% or more compared with the UK (30%), Korea (22%), China (17%), France

compared with a global average of 13%.The only countries where organizations were planning to decrease their security budget by more than 10% were France 
(3%), Japan (3%), Korea (2%) and China (1%).Globally, organizations allocated their cyber security budgets into four main categories: prevention (42%), detection 
(28%), containment (16%) and remediation (14%).Japan was the only country that changed the order slightly with an emphasis on detection being expressed by 40% of 
organizations followed by prevention (35%), containment (13%) and remediation (12%).REPORT \| CYBER TRENDSCAPE 20209Value of Cyber Security Solutions, Government and 
Regulatory AgenciesOrganizations broadly (57%) believed that the cost of cyber security was reasonable for the value it provides. A further 
25% believed it was inexpensive. Countries perceiving cyber security as inexpensive for the value it provides were Canada 
(42%) and the UK (38%).Participants in Japan (29%) and the U.S. (28%) believed cyber security was expensive for the benefits it provides.Expensive

were protecting their environment.Only 8% believed that technology providers and cyber security vendors were doing a 
very good job of protecting their environments which is similarly low to the 6% 
assessment for a very bad rating. Nearly matching results were also obtained for 
good with 34% and bad with 30%. Lastly 22% of organizations did not favor a net 
positive or negative assessment.Organizations were slightly more positive in their assessment of governments and 
regulatory agencies and how well they were doing at protecting their environments.A majority of participants believed governments and regulatory agencies were doing 
a good job (42%) or a very good job (11%). A neutral rating was provided by 19% of 
global respondents. Of the remaining organizations 23% believed governments and 
regulatory agencies were doing a bad job and 4% a very bad job.Analyst ObservationThe U.S. expressed the highest 
rate of the most negative views 
of governments and regulatory 
agencies with very bad

Cyber ThreatsMany factors impact the maturity of an organizations cyber security program and its ability to be resilient against 
cyber threats.Participants were asked to provide their insights into the formative elements of their own cyber security program, 
how the program was developed and how effective their organization was at responding to and addressing cyber 
security issues.Participants were also asked to describe their internal challenges to maturing their cyber security program and their 
biggest fears in the event of a breach.Security Program MaturityWhen assessing their cyber security programs, 27% of participants characterized them as semi\-formal approaches where 
efforts were mostly compliance\-driven and focused on addressing mandatory regulations, while 24% saw their programs 
as informal where the primary focus was addressing critical issues as they occurred.Globally, 23% of organizations reported formal security programs with a broad, risk\-based focus supporting continuous 
optimization of processes and approaches, compared to the U.S. (41%) and China (38%).Only 19% of organizations identified their security program as strategic with intelligence data driving investment 
decisions, operational priorities and other critical cyber security factors.Overall, 7% of organizations indicated they did not have a cyber security program at all. In Canada, this response 
jumped to 18%.FormalIntelligence DrivenSemi\-FormalInformalNo Cyber Security Program051015202530Percent of RespondentsFigure 18\. Security program maturity.REPORT \| CYBER TRENDSCAPE 202015Cyber Attack and Breach Response PlansCyber attack and breach event response plans are critical for ensuring organizational focus and resilience during a cyber 
security event.These plans consist of pre\-established and agreed upon actions, procedures, communications and leadership structure 
invoked in the event of a cyber incident. To minimize delays and distractions, plans also include legal agreements and 
pre\-negotiated contracts with all third\-parties that might augment operations or render assistance during an event.Among all organizations excluding those from the U.S 29% indicated the existence of mature cyber attack and breach 
event response and communications plans that are regularly reviewed and updated. The highest results were from the 
U.S. (62%) and China (39%).However, 29% of organizations reported that while they had cyber plans, they had not been tested or updated in 12 or 
more months.Over 30% of organizations indicated that cyber attack and breach event response plans were owned and maintained by 
individual businesses or applications and that they were not coordinated within an overall organization\-wide plan.While only 8% of organizations did not have any cyber attack and breach event response plans, the results were higher in 
Canada (19%) and Japan (15%).No plans

leading representative involved in the development or review of the cyber attack 
or breach response plan, followed by the chief compliance officer (CCO), IT 
security and finally IT operations staff (Fig. 20\).Analyst ObservationOverall, internal and external legal 
counsel were identified as among the 
roles least involved in the 
development of plans (Fig. 20\). This 
is in sharp contrast to recommended 
industry best practices, given that 
the main focus of legal counsel is to 
protect the organization from and 
minimize its exposure to risks. Legal 
counsel provides guidance on the 
acceptable levels of risks and 
obligations for their organization and 
ensures that legal frameworks are 
adhered to before, during and after a 
cyber attack or breach event to 
mitigate further impact.Line of business and business 
operations were consistently and 
universally identified as the least 
involved in the development and 
review of plans. This is notable 
because these groups are considered 
critical stakeholders in plans 
presumably designed to maintain 
business operations during an event.REPORT \| CYBER TRENDSCAPE 202016Line of Business Business OpsIT Security StaffIT Operations StaffExternal Cyber Security ConsultantsInternal Legal CounselExternal Legal CounselCSOCISOCROCPO \- Privacy OfficerCOOCMOCIOCFOCCO \- Compliance OfficerCEOBoard of DirectorsFigure 20\.

were nearly equally split. Forty\-nine percent 
considered their organization to be fully 
ready with the ability to respond well and 
47% indicated that some portions of their 
organization would be ready, but overall 
they would struggle to respond well. In the 
U.S 72% of respondents were confident in 
their organizations readiness to respond 
well to a cyber attack or breach incident, 
sharply contrasting with Japan (24%).Fourteen percent of organizations in Japan 
believed they were not ready and would 
not respond well to a cyber attack or 
breach event, which is significantly higher 
than the global average (just over 2%,

they believed provided the best protection and where they would focus future investments if they had unlimited 
budgets.Globally, participants were quite consistent when they identified the components that currently contributed the most 
positive impact to their organizations ability to prevent a cyber attack or breach. Specifically, vulnerability management 
had an edge over security software (both slightly above 16%). These were followed by employee training (14%) and then 
response plans and security hardware (both slightly above 12%).Security HardwareOutsourcingConsultingEmployee TrainingPeopleResponse PlansSecurity SoftwareVulnerability Management024681012141618Figure 23\.

their organizations ability to prevent a cyber attack or breach if they had the opportunity to 
dramatically increase its the budget or presence.The results were globally consistent: 15% of organizations believed that increasing the 
investment and presence of vulnerability management solutions within their environment 
would generate the most impactful results, followed by threat intelligence (13\.7%), threat 
hunting (12\.6%) and employee training (12%).Analyst ObservationOrganizations in France 
believed employee

sensitive data, followed by customers and business operation disruption.In the U.S. the greatest concern was business operations disruption. U.S. organizations were least concerned by the 
possibility of physical damage to real\-world infrastructure.Regulatory FinesOrganization's Liability and Exposure to LawsuitsOrganizational and Brand ReputationPhysical Damage to Real\-World InfrastructurePersonal RepercussionsPartner RelationshipsLoss of Sensitive DataImpact to Our CustomersBusiness Operation DisruptionFigure 26\.

plans to do so in the next 18 months. Only 7% reported 
they currently did not and had no plans to do so in the

insights into their overall readiness to adopt cloud technologies, their intended outcomes from cloud deployments, their 
perceptions of cloud security and how far along they had progressed toward the cloud.Drivers for Cloud InitiativesParticipants consistently identified that the top three motivations to pursue cloud were to reduce overall IT costs (27%), 
broaden enterprise agility (25%) and reduce datacenter footprint (20%).Reduce IT costsReduce datacenter footprintEnd\-of\-life softwareEnd\-of\-life hardwareBroaden enterprise agility051015202530Figure 28\.

average were Canada (20%) and Germany (15%).Overall, 31% of organizations had initiated projects to understand cloud, but security was 
not currently a main concern.Organizations with a basic understanding of cloud and cloud security issues represented 
21% of all responses. Another 21% indicated they had a moderate understanding of cloud 
and had initiated pilot deployments.Globally, 17% of organizations reported a strong understanding of cloud and cloud security

reduce business risks.This intelligence is built from collection of reports that contain a wide range of information, such as vulnerability data, 
detailed descriptions of tools and techniques used by attackers and comprehensive attribution of a threat actor with a 
full history of their activity and the intent. These reports can be used on their own to assess risks within an environment 
and can also be used in conjunction with SIEM and other cyber security solutions.Participants were asked to provide insights into their adoption of threat intelligence subscriptions or feeds as well as their 
perceived utility, value and effectiveness of the intelligence.Adoption of Cyber Threat Intelligence FeedsParticipants reported that 32% of organizations integrated free and paid intelligence feeds with their SIEM.In Japan, 18% of organizations neither had nor planned to integrate intelligence feeds with their SIEMmore than three
