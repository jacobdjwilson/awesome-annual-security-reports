## How We Defined and Researched the 2026 SIA Security Megatrends

Each year at Securing New Ground (SNG), senior-level industry leaders and financial partners gather, trends are discussed, connections are formed and ideas are shared openly. In advance of SNG, as part of our annual membership survey, SIA asked hundreds of executives from SIA member companies what factors were shaping their business decisions and what trends they were watching. We then spoke with numerous SIA members, along with current and recent speakers and attendees of SNG, about which previous trends were still relevant, which trends were no longer as impactful to the industry and which trends could be identified to be added to our report.

Securing New Ground, our annual executive conference, serves as the rallying point for the Security Megatrends project.

In advance of the event, numerous discussions are held with core advisors about the trends, which remain relevant, what has changed and what new trends are affecting the industry’s direction. This group of SIA Security Megatrends advisors provides hours of focused feedback on the megatrends via in-depth conversations and collaborative editing. The value of insights from these leaders and luminaries cannot be overstated (thank you, Steve Van Till, Tara Dunning, Eric Yunag and Devin Love). I also want to thank so many individual SIA members who I engaged with on conversations about trends in their sector that aligned directly with Security Megatrends under consideration. In that area, I want to thank Ken Francis, CEO of Actuate, and the entire SIA Executive Advisory Board (EAB) that he chairs. This group’s reports on integrator trends and industry expansion are valuable additional reading. I’d also like to thank EAB member Scott Elkins of Zeus Fire & Security for his perspective.

In addition to the member survey research and the focused conversations, the selection of these trends relies on the speakers, panel and audience members of SNG, because the conference is the ultimate proving ground for deep-dive discussions on what we can do as an industry to pave a successful future. A special session during the 2026 SNG conference from Steve, Tara, Devin and Eric provided additional feedback related to the Security Megatrends and helped generate key trends in this report. Lastly, as we authored this report, we tried to reflect not only the vendor/integrator/service provider side of the industry, but also reflections on how each trend may impact the security practitioner or CSO.

## Building a Better Future—Together!

Thank you for engaging with this year’s Security Megatrends report. We are proud to produce this report as a benefit for all Security Industry Association members and as a resource to help guide the security industry at large. These insights are designed to inspire, and inform, prepare us for the opportunities and challenges ahead.

Among the trends shaping our future, the shift from the traditional channel model to the value chain (Megatrend 3 in this year’s list) is the most transformative. The channel was built for transactions; the value chain is built for collaboration and outcomes. When our industry aligns around the needs and outcomes of the end-user security practitioner, every stakeholder thrives—manufacturers, integrators, service providers, and practitioners alike. This evolution ensures security is not just delivered—it is co-created, driving resilience, innovation, and shared success.

Together, we will build a future where security delivers measurable business value and empowers every professional to excel. The future is bright—and built together.

Sincerely,
Scott Dunn
Chair, SIA Board of Directors

## Executive Takeaways from SNG

“Right now in security, data is a whole new business emerging on top of the ‘old’ business of security. The right pieces come together to deliver it as a business model. Data doesn’t do anything in and of itself without getting insights out of it. Data drives opportunity, and it’s a great new business model.”
—Tim Palmquist, vice president, Americas, Milestone Systems, on how data is the new oil

“Ideally those level 1, 2, 3 alarms and incidents are being managed by the systems so we can do a better job managing bigger incidents and paying attention to critical things.”
—Sobie Velasquez, vice president, physical security technology, Morgan Stanley, on what AI promises corporate security leaders

“The security data by itself can be valuable, but what becomes more so is when you bring it into other data from the organization or external data and be able to make decisions and do risk assessments.”
—Hans Kahler, chief operating officer, Eagle Eye Networks, on opportunity to build new business models that leverage the value of data

“Technology for technology’s sake isn’t the point. We’re moving to be more business enablers and advisors—taking these shiny new objects and applying them to our current products, looking at future products and being able to pace them as innovation evolves.”
—Ewa Pigna, chief technology officer, Honeywell, on how CTOs stay focused on business

## Executive Takeaways from SNG

“We’re stewards of the industry and keep the customer first. It’s a customer-first perspective, which seems to now be true across the industry, not just at Convergint.”
—Ann Fandozzi, CEO, Convergint, on how firms navigate challenging situations like tariffs so as to not pass disruption on to customers or burden them with surprise costs

"What’s a problem we’re trying to solve for our customer? Anchor it in a real-life use case and get the customer actively participating in the development cycle. We have technology in our titles, but focusing on just the tech is focusing on the wrong thing. Focus on the real problems customers have and how you can use technology to achieve your goals and solve those problems."
–Christian Morin, vice president, product engineering, Genetec

“We do the opposite of what everyone else might do. That separates us. We do the counterintuitive thing—be different in a good way.”
—Brian Sloan, CEO, Wachter, on remaining innovative in business

“We’re looking for enhancements within our existing products. We’re looking for utilization of AI within our existing databases. We’re looking for automation within our existing tools we already have. We don’t want new tools and don’t necessarily need new tools. We have enough tools. We want to hear there’s a light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to the tools we have. And we need more conversation about what we’re actually doing within the products we already have.”
—Bobby Louissaint, head of technical partnership engagement, GSST, Meta, on why outcomes are more meaningful for practitioners than simply embracing new technology

“Know your customer. What’s the sector? What’s their size and scale? What past performance is going to be relevant and resonate? Bring the innovation and be able to think around the corner.”
—Cheryl Steele, former chief security officer for Starbucks, on how global security solution providers can best serve security practitioners

## SOFTWARE EATS THE WORLD.
WILL AI EAT SOFTWARE?

The security industry has witnessed a dramatic shift over the past decade: hardware, once the dominant force, has ceded ground to software. Historically, system identity was tied to physical components—cameras, network video recorders (NVRs), access panels and readers. Today, the conversation has flipped. End users increasingly identify their systems by software brands, not hardware manufacturers. This evolution reflects a broader truth: the user experience is shaped by software interfaces, not the devices behind them.

As software gained dominance, cloud-based delivery accelerated the trend. SaaS solutions have steadily eaten into the market for on-premises platforms, driven by the need for remote access, outsourced technical support and vendor-managed updates. While adoption varies—only 7% of organizations report that 75% of their application stack is SaaS—the trajectory is clear. Newer companies lean heavily toward cloud-first strategies, and even legacy platforms are being redeveloped for hybrid or cloud-native delivery. Advances in bandwidth, compression and scalable storage have reduced friction, even for data-heavy applications like video surveillance.

Now, artificial intelligence introduces a new layer of disruption. Industry leaders call AI a “mass extinction event for software,” as agentic AI begins replicating functionality once hard-coded into applications. Headlines such as “Anthropic Says Its AI Can Clone Enterprise Apps Like Slack” underscore the potential for AI-native solutions to replace traditional software models. While tight hardware-software integration currently provides a moat for security vendors, AI will reshape workflows, automate reporting and enhance analytics. The question is no longer hypothetical: AI may not “eat” security software, but it will dramatically influence software—how soon and how deeply remains the critical debate.

“If you’re not
in the game
of making
software,
you’re not
going to be in
the game.”

## THE SECURITY HARDWARE LAYER
IS REINVENTED

As software and cloud solutions have dominated the security landscape, hardware providers are reinventing their role to avoid becoming commoditized peripherals. Hardware remains the lifeblood of the industry—producing the critical data that software and AI depend on to deliver value—which means hardware must evolve beyond simple sensing to become intelligent, integrated and indispensable.

Manufacturers are embedding software and AI-lite analytics directly into devices, transforming them from passive endpoints into active contributors within a system of systems. Cameras, for example, are no longer just video sensors—they now combine audio, motion detection and environmental monitoring. This multi-sensor approach satisfies AI’s hunger for rich, contextual data. Standards-based architectures, open APIs and unified data models are critical to unlocking this potential, enabling interoperability and seamless integration.

The future favors hardware that delivers actionable insights, supports digital twins and interacts dynamically with buildings. Point solutions will lose relevance, while powered sensors and edge devices become essential for AI-driven security ecosystems. Ultimately, hardware’s value will be measured by its ability to feed clean, normalized data into platforms that enable automation, analytics and intelligent decision making.

“Data
normalization
between
products
needs to be a
standard.”

## SECURITY SOLUTIONS
LOSE THEIR BOUNDARIES

Security is no longer confined to physical protection—it is expanding into a holistic ecosystem that integrates building systems, IT infrastructure and operational technologies. This megatrend, highlighted at SNG 2025 as “Expanding the Boundaries of Security Solutions,” reflects a shift from traditional video surveillance toward visual intelligence and enterprise-wide value creation.

Buyers now seek multi-use technologies that deliver operational insights alongside security benefits. This convergence spans software, cameras, sensors, access control, fire safety, HVAC, lighting and utilities—creating unified platforms that enable intelligent control across cyber and physical domains. The benefits are transformative: predictive maintenance, situational awareness, mass communication, operational efficiency and sustainability. Real-world examples include integrated responses in data centers, where cameras validate alerts from environmental sensors, and campus environments where AV systems, lighting and access control collaborate for emergency response. These integrations redefine security’s role, positioning it as a driver of resilience and efficiency. Organizational structures are evolving too. Some firms consolidate building and security technologies under one group, while others create tech-focused teams within security departments to unlock added value. The boundaries of security are dissolving—and with them, the perception of security as a siloed function.

“Our industry’s boundaries are rapidly vanishing. Convergence across all technology stacks allows us to provide unified insights and control across the business ecosystem, which leads to safer, more efficient, more sustainable and more resilient enterprises.”

—TARA DUNNING, VICE PRESIDENT, CONVERGING TECHNOLOGY, WESCO

## THE VALUE CHAIN REPLACES
THE CHANNEL MODEL

The traditional channel model in the security industry was built on a linear path: manufacturers produced products, distributors handled logistics, integrators installed and maintained systems and practitioners used them. This structure prioritized efficiency in moving products to market but often created friction when roles overlapped—such as manufacturers selling directly to end users.

Today, that model is being replaced by the Value Chain, a framework that centers on customer outcomes rather than product delivery. Instead of pushing products through a pipeline, the value chain aligns hardware, software, AI/data, services and operations around solving end-user challenges.

This shift transforms the industry from transactional to collaborative, where success is measured by resilience, integration and business impact rather than unit sales.

In the value chain, “sell-through becomes build-with”—manufacturers, integrators and service providers work together to co-create solutions tailored to enterprise needs. Efficiency gives way to adaptability, and competition evolves into partnership. For security leaders, this means vendors must deliver holistic solutions that integrate physical security with IT, operations and business objectives. The result is a more dynamic ecosystem where innovation thrives and customer value drives every decision.

“Being able to solve customer problems with all partners is incredibly exciting. It’s also the challenge. There’s a Venn diagram of complexity—who owns the customer relationship? How can we pass value down through the channel, through the integrator, and can we still solve the problem for the end user? We have a responsibility to solve customer problems, and we have to do it together.”

—BRET HOLBROOK, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, DORMAKABA USA

## POSTHUMAN AUTOMATION OF
SECURITY

Yes, this Megatrend is intentionally provocative. And no, we don’t really expect all humans will be removed from security. What we do believe is that the security industry is entering a new era where automation and agentic AI redefine how systems operate and decisions are made.

Historically, security technology focused on detection and response, but advancements in AI now enable a shift toward prevention—an aspiration long held by practitioners. Agentic AI introduces capabilities that go beyond simple automation, allowing systems to interpret data, make decisions and execute actions without human intervention.

This transformation is already visible. AI-driven platforms are replacing labor-intensive tasks such as monitoring video feeds, ranking alarms and managing visitor access. Predictions suggest that AI will eventually handle universal scene analysis and automate processes traditionally managed by humans, including badge issuance and access permissions. While concerns about job displacement persist—highlighted by reports of AI-related layoffs—the reality is more nuanced. Rather than a mass extinction of roles, AI is expected to augment human capabilities, enabling professionals to focus on high-priority issues and strategic risk management. The opportunity lies in leveraging AI for incremental gains: automating security reports, reviewing footage and interrogating data for trends and incident response. Practitioners seek tools that reduce friction and unlock hidden value, aligning with the principle of “aggregation of marginal gains.”

Embracing this change proactively will ensure AI empowers rather than replaces the security workforce.

“The idea of post human security automation—which calls out the core of the transformation we’re all contemplating with AI—begs the question of trust and reliability, to be sure, but more importantly underscores the reality of current labor trends leading to the decimation of the lowest rungs on the ladder, including the majority of roles in a traditional monitoring center or SOC.”

–STEVE VAN TILL, PRESIDENT AND CEO, BRIVO

“This industry is ripe for being able to use the force multiplying benefits of agentic AI. It can handle lower-priority requests and automate them, and allow humans to focus on high-priority issues coming in.”
– STEVE LINDSEY, CO-FOUNDER, LVT

“The old benchmark used to be that ‘One day we’ll pass the Turing test,’ but we’ve already passed it 2 years ago and are moving on. AI can now do video things way better than a human can.”
 – SHIKHAR SHRESTHA, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, AMBIENT AI

### Adapt or Extinct?

To ensure that AI isn’t a mass extinction event for your role, leverage AI to the best of your ability and embrace change head on, rather than wait.

### Potential opportunities to develop agents for security:
*   Automating security reports
*   Automating user access permission reviews
*   Automating review of security footage
*   Automating learning for security professionals that matches their knowledge levels and gaps

### What Practitioners Need From AI

*   **Interrogation of Data**: Assessments, trends and incident response
*   **Reshaping Personnel**: Security Awareness Content Creation Training
*   **Appropriate Use of AI Within Security**: Services that don't create security risk exposure
*   **Ability to Solve Small Problems**: A path to achieving greater insight and operational efficiency

![Image description: A graphic illustrating the potential applications and practitioner needs for AI in security.](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300)

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
*   Agentic AI shifts security from detection to prevention.
*   Automation reduces human involvement in routine tasks like monitoring and access control.
*   AI disruption is real but will augment, not eliminate, professional roles.
*   Opportunities include automated reporting, video review and data-driven insights.
*   Success depends on embracing AI strategically to enhance efficiency and resilience.

## END-TO-END SOLUTIONS AND ONE-
LOGO APPROACHES

The security industry is witnessing a significant shift as vendors move beyond their traditional single-product categories to deliver comprehensive, end-to-end solutions. Historically, manufacturers specialized in narrow segments—video surveillance, access control or networking—but today, boundaries are dissolving. Companies like Axis Communications, Hanwha, Motorola Solutions and i-PRO have expanded from video into offerings for access control and even communications, while Verkada rapidly evolved from cameras to access, alarms and air quality monitoring. Even IT-focused firms like Ubiquiti have entered the security space, adding video and access solutions to their networking portfolios. And there are countless more examples of solution manufacturers transforming their product lines.

This evolution is driven by customer demand for simplicity and integration. Small and midmarket buyers increasingly prefer unified platforms that reduce complexity and eliminate the need to manage multiple vendors. For some, the appeal of a “one-logo” approach mirrors IT strategies where organizations standardize on a single provider, such as Microsoft, to streamline operations and support.

For security integrators, this trend has profound implications. To remain competitive, an integrator must offer at least one end-to-end solution in their portfolio. Buyers expect vendors and partners to deliver holistic systems that combine situational awareness, security and operational efficiency—without the heavy lifting of multiplatform integration. The future belongs to those who can provide seamless, scalable solutions under one brand.

“How are you going to make my life easier as a CSO? That is what I’m looking for from a vendor. I’m looking for a tool that will help the entire enterprise, not just physical security.”

—DAVID FORTINO, HEAD OF CORPORATE SECURITY, NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER ENTERPRISES

### From One to Many

In Megatrend 3, we pronounced that security solutions are losing their boundaries —becoming more relevant as systems that capture and process data, be that for security or operational management. In this megatrend, we pronounce that traditional single-line product vendors are losing their boundaries, too, and are moving toward end-to-end solution models through R&D or acquisition.

### Traditional Single-Line Vendor Examples

*   Video software vendor
*   Video hardware vendor
*   Access hardware vendor
*   Access software vendor
*   Communications vendor
*   Security operations center platform vendor
*   Intrusion hardware vendor
*   Intrusion monitoring software vendor

### versus

### End-to-End Solutions

1.  No integration required
2.  Compatibility across different product sectors
3.  Locked to a single vendor
4.  May offer limited customization and features

![Image description: A comparison chart showing the shift from traditional single-line vendors to end-to-end solutions.](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300)

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
*   Single-product vendors are expanding into adjacent categories through research and development and acquisitions.
*   End-to-end solutions appeal to buyers seeking simplicity and integrated functionality.
*   One-logo strategies reduce complexity and mirror IT standardization trends.
*   Security integrators must include at least one comprehensive solution in their offerings.
*   Unified platforms deliver security and operational efficiency without multivendor challenges.

## THE UNIFICATION OF THE SECURITY
EXPERIENCE LAYER

The security industry is moving toward a unified experience layer—a transformation that goes beyond integrating systems to fundamentally change how security is managed and experienced. Historically, platforms for access control, video surveillance and intrusion operated in silos, creating fragmented workflows and leaving valuable data underutilized. Today, the push for unified platforms and data aggregation is reshaping this landscape.

Unification begins with the data layer. Security systems generate massive amounts of information—video feeds, access logs, sensor alerts—but much of it remains untapped. By consolidating these data streams into a single architecture or overlay platform, organizations can surface actionable insights, automate responses and improve decision making. This evolution accelerates progress toward AI-driven outcomes, enabling predictive analytics and intelligent automation.

For smaller organizations, unified experience layers democratize advanced capabilities once reserved for enterprises with deep resources. Whether through end-to-end solutions or software overlays, the goal is not a “single pane of glass” but a smarter, more intuitive interface that enhances both operational efficiency and user experience. Ultimately, unification transforms security from a reactive function into a proactive, integrated component of business resilience.

## SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTERS
(SOCS) AND MONITORING WILL BE
TRANSFORMED AND AUTOMATED

### Part 1. Transformation of the Security Operations Center

The era of the “showcase” SOC—characterized by massive video walls and rows of operators passively staring at screens—is rapidly drawing to a close. A fundamental disruption is underway, driven not by a desire for grander facilities, but by a relentless push for efficiency through automation and virtualization. This shift is democratizing advanced security capabilities, making global security operations center (GSOC)-level protection accessible to smaller enterprises that could never previously afford a dedicated command center.

The traditional SOC model is being dismantled by the twin forces of virtualization and AI. Organizations no longer feel the need to build physical “war rooms” where teams are co-located. Instead, decentralized, virtual teams are managing global command functions remotely, often supported by outsourced providers. Simultaneously, AI is rendering the “video wall” obsolete. Intelligent analytics now handle the monitoring, freeing human staff from the tedium of watching screens. This allows security personnel to pivot from reactive notification watchers to proactive risk analysts, focusing their energy on anticipating threats rather than responding to routine pings.

The security industry is experiencing a seismic shift, driven by automation, AI and virtualization. Two areas at the center of this transformation are the traditional
