## STATE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY 2026

### Foreword

Rapid technological innovation is reshaping
the future of physical security.

Organizations are now discovering how new technologies
enhance the safety and responsiveness of their security
systems. As capabilities expand, so do the possibilities.
The real impact of these technologies, however, will
depend on how they are applied.

This report explores how the industry is adapting and
how strategic innovation¹ is redefining what’s possible
in physical security.

Technology must be managed and deployed with
intention, not for its own sake. AI-driven analytics, for
example, add value only when paired with responsible
data practices and clear operational goals. Similarly,
cloud adoption succeeds when it strengthens resilience
and enables collaboration, not when it adds complexity.
Success depends on aligning technology with purpose,
ensuring it serves people, processes, and outcomes rather
than existing as an end in itself.

As the industry continues to transform, collaboration
is critical among physical security teams, information
technology (IT) teams, and solution providers, including
channel partners and manufacturers. Together, they
can bridge gaps, align systems, and build smarter,
more resilient approaches to protection. This partnership
is key to unlocking the full potential of modern physical
security operations.

We’re pleased to share the findings of this sixth edition and
hope you find the insights both engaging and valuable.

The Genetec Team

¹ Strategic innovation, in this report, refers to the intentional application of new ideas and technologies to address today’s challenges and shape the future
of physical security. It aligns innovation with long-term objectives, driving meaningful progress while enhancing operational effectiveness.

### Compliance as a measure of maturity

As industries mature, regulations
follow close behind. These often
concern standardization, risk
management, trust, and compliance.
Survey results found this was true
for physical security, especially now
that security teams are partnering
more with IT. These frameworks
ensure that the right systems
are installed, maintained, and
operated to protect both physical
and digital assets.

Only 16% of end users said their

### Achieving versatility with cloud and hybrid-cloud

Organizations are looking to maximize
flexibility and performance. Survey
findings suggest that respondents
understand they don’t need to be
confined to a cloud-only deployment.
Instead, they have the freedom to
choose the approach that fits their
operational needs.

According to the results, users are
settling into defined cloud strategies,
favoring hybrid models that balance

scalability with the flexibility to keep
specific workloads on-premises
when needed. This includes
partitioning systems into distinct
security zones² to ensure that critical
functions remain operational even
during cloud disruptions. Doing this
enhances resilience, continuity, and
control across both cloud-connected
and local systems.

### A sunny outlook for cloud adoption

Cloud growth is signaling confidence
in modern, connected technology.
Manufacturers, channel partners, and
consultants anticipate that end users
will have continued interest in moving
parts of their security infrastructure
to the cloud.

While some end user hesitancy
remains due to concerns over data loss,
pricing, ownership costs, and vendor
lock-in, physical security practitioners
are trending toward incremental cloud
adoption aligned with business needs.

61%

of consultants expect their customers to
shift some workloads to the cloud within the
next 12 months (up from 58% previously).

72%

of consultants say they plan to specify hybrid
deployments over the next five years,
signaling a pragmatic, hybrid-first transition.

Insight
71% of channel partner respondents expect new cloud
system deployments in 2026, while only 3% anticipate
any decline in adoption.

“Cloud or on-prem, or a
mix of both? The right
deployment depends on
your organization’s size,
security environment,
and priorities.

That’s why deployment
choice matters.”

According to survey data, adoption strategies also vary by system scale:

### Cloud deployment strategy

Organizations by camera count

BY END USER ORGANIZATION CAMERA COUNT.

Large organizations are less likely
to depend on on-camera storage
(SD cards) and are unlikely to adopt
full cloud hosting within the next
five years. Redundancy and scalability
continue to be the strongest

drivers for large organizations to
choose hybrid models, where cloud
appliances help bridge on-premises
infrastructure with cloud services,
supporting reliable performance
across complex environments.

### Growing momentum for access control in the cloud

Access control as a service (ACaaS)
is beginning to gain ground

#### Planned access control
capabilities for 2026

This is due to its deployment ease and
lighter data requirements, minimal
cloud setup, and straightforward
hardware needs. Among respondents,
11% of end users indicated full
deployment of their access control
system in the cloud, while 27%
operated hybrid systems.

Survey responses suggest that
organizations are prioritizing
scalability and modernization as they
expand access control functionality.
The demand for AI-driven alarms,
multi-factor authentication, and
mobile credentials is helping fuel
the rise of ACaaS deployments:

#### What capabilities do you plan to add to your
access control system in 2026?

### Physical security data: A shared asset

Physical security departments
serve as custodians of extensive
data across a wide array of systems
and sensors. This data underpins
operational intelligence for both
security operations and organizations
as a whole. As security systems
mature, data is facilitating smarter,
more connected operations.

While IT teams have always
understood and managed the value
of this strategic resource, physical
security is starting to recognize the
importance of sharing and receiving
data. Survey findings reveal that
25% of end users share data with and
receive data from other departments.

#### What departments receive physical security data
in your organization?

| Department             | Percentage |
| :--------------------- | :--------- |
| Security operations    | 46%        |
| Information technology | 54%        |
| HR                     | 26%        |
| Facilities             | 25%        |
| Accounting             | 9%         |
| Physical security      | 46%        |
| Operations             | 18%        |
| Other                  | 15%        |
| Health and safety      | 5%         |
