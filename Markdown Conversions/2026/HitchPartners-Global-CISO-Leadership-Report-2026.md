Introduction & Methodology

Introduction

Presented by Hitch Partners, the 2026 Global Organization Report analyzes the evolving

landscape of security leadership. Now in its ninth annual edition, the report provides critical

insight into compensation trends, reporting structures, and the expanding responsibilities of

security executives in 2025.

625+

SURVEY RESPONDENTS

This year's analysis examines both Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and NextGen

security leaders. While CISOs continue to shape security strategy and communicate risk at

9th

the executive level, NextGen security leaders who operate just below the CISO are playing an

ANNUAL EDITION

increasingly pivotal role in executing strategy, owning key security programs, and driving

operational excellence.

93%

NORTH AMERICAN COVERAGE

As threats to infrastructure and applications intensify, demand for seasoned security

leadership remains high. Both CISOs and NextGen security leaders are commanding

competitive compensation as organizations prioritize security at the highest levels.

Hitch Partners specializes in executive search and sector advocacy, equipping security

leaders with data-driven insights to navigate this dynamic field. We welcome your feedback

and invite you to share topics you'd like us to explore in future reports.

Methodology

This report is based on survey responses from more than 625+ Information Security

executives across North America (U.S. and Canada) and select international markets.

Responses were collected between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 and represent a broad cross-

section of industries, company sizes, and organizational models providing a comprehensive

view of how security leadership is evolving as we enter 2026.

Scope & Definitions

"CISO" Definition: Throughout this report, CISO refers to the most senior security leader

accountable for an organization's information security strategy, program execution, and risk

management. This encompasses multiple titles, including:

• Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

• Chief Security Officer (CSO)

• Head of Security / Head of Information Security

• Vice President of Security / VP of Information Security

• Senior Director of Security (when serving as top security role)

"NextGen" Definition: "NextGen" refers to the security leadership layer directly reporting to

the CISO—typically the top 3-5 security leaders responsible for executing the security

program across specialized domains. These roles represent the next generation of CISO

talent and include titles such as:

• Deputy CISO
• Head of Security / Security Engineering

• Vice President of Product Security / Application Security
• Senior Director / Director of Security (domain-specific: Cloud, Identity, GRC, etc.)

NextGen leaders translate CISO strategy into operational execution, combining strategic

alignment with hands-on program leadership. They typically manage teams of 5 to 50+

security professionals within their areas of specialization.

Geographic Segments

This report highlights the North American security leadership market, a space Hitch Partners

has supported through security leadership searches for more than a decade. With

respondents based in the U.S. and Canada, the dataset offers a robust regional view of

compensation benchmarks, organizational structures, and evolving security priorities.

Expanding Global Coverage: Beginning in 2025, we expanded our data collection beyond

North America to include European and broader international markets to establish baseline

benchmarks and better understand regional differences in security leadership practices. While

international respondents currently account for a significantly lower percentage of total

responses, we are committed to increasing global representation in future editions.

Current International Representation:

• European Union: Concentrated in Germany, France, and the Netherlands
• United Kingdom: London, other major business centers

• Scandinavia: Norway, Sweden, Denmark

• Middle East: UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel
• Australia: Sydney and Melbourne metro areas

As the international dataset matures over the next 12–24 months, we will introduce deeper

regional analysis, including market-specific compensation benchmarks, regulatory drivers

(such as GDPR, NIS2, and DORA), and structural differences in security organizations. In this

year's edition, international findings are presented alongside North American data where

sample sizes support statistically meaningful comparisons. All international compensation

figures have been converted to USD using exchange rates as of January 11, 2026, to ensure

direct comparability.

Acknowledgment & Thanks

We extend our sincere thanks to the security leaders who contributed their time and insight to

this report, and to the broader community who helped rally participation across North America

and international markets. This benchmark exists because of your engagement and trust.

We are grateful to the many CISOs and security leaders we connected with throughout the

year at CISO Sanctuary gatherings, speaking engagements, our annual Brewery Party, Black

Hat, and other industry events around the world. These conversations continue to shape our

perspective and strengthen this community.

We also want to recognize and thank the Hitch team for the care, rigor, and coordination

behind this effort - from research and analysis to community outreach and execution.

We look forward to even deeper engagement in 2026 and remain committed to supporting

and advocating for a security leadership community we truly admire and care about.

CIO reporting remains significant at 22% (private) and 34% (public), with steady but slower

growth of +2% and +4% respectively. The CIO line reflects traditional IT-centric security

models, while the accelerating CTO trend suggests organizations increasingly view security as

integral to product development and engineering velocity.

Key Insight: Security teams peak at 5K-10K employees (243 personnel) representing maximum
centralization. Beyond 10K employees, teams contract 47% as organizations federate security
responsibilities across platform teams and business units.

The “federation effect” becomes visible for organizations larger than 10,000 employees, where

average team size contracts 47% to 129. Large enterprises distribute security responsibilities

into other organizations including platform teams, IT functions, and enterprise risk (GRC). The

CISO role transitions from large, self contained organization to governance, influence, and

strategic oversight across federated security capabilities.
