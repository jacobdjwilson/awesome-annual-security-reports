©2026 VulnCheck, Inc. All Rights Reserved.In 2025,

VulnCheck identified 884 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities

(KEVs) for which evidence of exploitation was observed for

the first time. By using the CVE publication date as a proxy

for when defenders often gain awareness of a vulnerability,

we can better understand how quickly exploitation follows

disclosure and awareness. Our analysis shows that 28.96% of

KEVs in 2025 were exploited on or before the day their CVE

was published, an increase from the 23.6% observed in our

2024 trends in exploitation report, highlighting the continued

prevalence of both zero-day[1] and n-day exploitation. This

reinforces the urgency for organizations to act quickly on

newly disclosed vulnerabilities while continuing to reduce

long-standing vulnerability backlogs.

Throughout 2025, exploitation evidence was first reported by

over 100 unique organizations, including security researchers,

cybersecurity vendors, and software suppliers. Attackers

continued to focus on internet-facing and widely deployed

technologies, while also opportunistically exploiting a long tail

of enterprise software, hardware, and emerging technology

such as AI.

These trends demonstrate that exploitation speed remains

consistently high year over year, and that defenders must

prioritize visibility into exploited vulnerabilities with timely

remediation in order to keep pace with attackers.

Exploitation of Real
Vulnerable Hosts
Not on CISA KEV

In October 2025, we added exploitation indicators to VulnCheck KEV

sourced from VulnCheck's Canary Intelligence service. When exploitation

of a vulnerability is detected against a real vulnerable host that we have

deployed, an indicator is added to VulnCheck KEV. This provides valuable

insight into technologies where exploitation has been observed on

real-world systems, but the vulnerabilities are not listed in CISA KEV.

Year

The spike observed in 2021 and 2022 is likely a direct result

of the initial release of CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities

(KEV) catalog, which included early additions and associated

ransomware attribution. We are now likely seeing stabilization

in the number of vulnerabilities used in ransomware

campaigns. However, because ransomware attribution is often

delayed relative to initial exploitation disclosures, we expect

attribution for vulnerabilities known to be exploited in 2025 to

continue increasing as additional research is published.

Summary

2025 reinforces the reality that exploitation speed remains a defining

challenge for defenders. With nearly 900 KEVs first observed as

exploited during the year, sustained prevalence of zero-day and n-day

exploitation activity, and continued targeting of internet-facing and

widely deployed enterprise technologies, organizations face little

margin for delayed response. While time-to-exploitation patterns

remained consistent with 2024, the scale and breadth of affected

vendors, products, and technologies continue to expand. Maintaining

strong vulnerability management practices, prioritizing trusted

exploitation intelligence, and monitoring beyond the CISA KEV catalog

remain critical to reducing exposure and staying ahead of adversaries.

Considerations For This Report

•

 Not all KEVs being exploited on the same day of CVE issuance

are Zero Days.

•

 The CVE for 81 of the KEVs that were identified as being

exploited in the wild during 2025 were published by VulnCheck

through the VulnCheck research team, partnership with

ShadowServer, and from our report a vulnerability service.

Patrick Garrity is a security researcher at

VulnCheck where he focuses on vulnerabilities,

vulnerability exploitation and threat actors.
