STATE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY 2026

Foreword

Rapid technological innovation is reshaping
the future of physical security.

Organizations are now discovering how new technologies
enhance the safety and responsiveness of their security
systems. As capabilities expand, so do the possibilities.
The real impact of these technologies, however, will
depend on how they are applied.

This report explores how the industry is adapting and
how strategic innovation^1 is redefining what’s possible
in physical security.

Technology must be managed and deployed with
intention, not for its own sake. AI-driven analytics, for
example, add value only when paired with responsible
data practices and clear operational goals. Similarly,
cloud adoption succeeds when it strengthens resilience
and enables collaboration, not when it adds complexity.
Success depends on aligning technology with purpose,
ensuring it serves people, processes, and outcomes rather
than existing in itself.

As the industry continues to transform, collaboration
is critical among physical security teams, information
technology (IT) teams, and solution providers, including
channel partners and manufacturers. Together, they
can bridge gaps, align systems, and build smarter,
more resilient approaches to protection. This partnership
is key to unlocking the full potential of modern physical
security operations.

We’re pleased to share the findings of this sixth edition and
hope you find the insights both engaging and valuable.

The value in doing more

“Customers are increasingly expecting security
systems not only to protect but also to deliver operational
insights and business value.”

– Channel partner respondent

Physical security technology
is no longer about individual tools.
Survey findings point to a shift in
how physical security systems are

business decision making

END USER RESPONSES ONLY.

It’s no surprise that large enterprises, with their robust
systems and staff, are most likely to use physical security
data. However, data use is common across organizations
of all sizes. This highlights how data is repositioning
security from a budget line item to a driver of efficiency,
insight, and resilience.

AI and analytics: From sensing to sense-making

Artificial intelligence (AI) expectations
are all over the map. AI can make
physical security more effective at
detecting anomalies, anticipating
incidents, and enabling faster, more
confident decision-making when

the technology is implemented
properly. But realizing this potential
requires connected systems and the
elimination of barriers to data-sharing.

“AI/LLM applications are driving
demand for smarter analytics,
predictive monitoring, and automation.
Customers are requesting both
AI-enabled products and training.”

Some organizations are already advancing their adoption of AI and
data visualization tools. Survey results show that large organizations
are experimenting more and leading this shift, supported by
bigger budgets and larger IT and physical security teams. For these
companies, it’s more feasible to embrace and adopt these innovations.

All eyes on AI in the year ahead

AI is a preoccupation for physical security. For the first time, AI ranked
alongside access control and video surveillance as a key priority for 2026.

What type of project will be the focus
of your department for next year?

As adoption and interest grow, the
pressure is on channel partners and
manufacturers to deliver AI solutions
that meet user needs. End users are
focused on where they can find value,
but many need support to find a way
to benefit from AI-based technology.

Survey findings reveal that end users
see value in systems that leverage
AI to improve security operations by
helping operators navigate alarms
and investigations, reducing noise,
and prioritizing the events that matter.

However, no single solution stands out.
End users still need guidance, not only
in choosing the right products but in
understanding how AI can translate
into real-world impact.

System integrators and manufacturers
will need to collaborate closely with
end users, innovate responsibly,
and manage expectations to deliver
meaningful, measurable outcomes
with this technology.
