### Paolo Dal Cin
Global Cybersecurity
Lead, Accenture

In an era defined by accelerating technological
change, persistent geopolitical volatility and
widening capability gaps, the cyber landscape has
become both a catalyst for progress and a vector
of profound risk.

Cybersecurity risk in 2026 is accelerating,
fuelled by advances in AI, deepening geopolitical
fragmentation and the complexity of supply
chains. These shifts are compounded by the
enduring sovereignty dilemma and widespread
cyber inequity, two factors that expose systemic
vulnerabilities. The result is a threat environment
where the speed and scale of attacks are testing
the limits of traditional defences.

Now in its fifth year, the Global Cybersecurity Outlook
has become an authoritative reference, empowering
leaders with the insights they need to navigate cyber
challenges, as well as an important instrument with
which to redefine business strategy, enterprise
investments and government initiatives and seize the
opportunities of today’s cybersecurity landscape.

By examining leaders’ perspectives and highlighting
the priorities that drive success, this report
delivers a clear message: cybersecurity is not
predetermined. Its future depends on the choices
we make today. By investing in foresight, capability
and innovation, and by strengthening collaboration
across industries, sectors and national boundaries,
we can transform volatility into momentum and
build a safer, more resilient digital future together.

## Executive summary

Cybersecurity is a frontier where collaboration
remains not only possible, but powerful.

Cybersecurity in 2026 is accelerating amid
growing threats, geopolitical fragmentation and a
widening technological divide. Artificial intelligence
(AI) is transforming cyber on both sides of the
fight – strengthening defence while enabling more
sophisticated attacks. Organizations are striving to
balance innovation with security – embracing AI and
automation at scale, even as governance frameworks
and human expertise struggle to keep pace. The
result is a fast-paced, metamorphic landscape where
disruptions move swiftly across borders, even as
technology offers new potential for resilience.

This year’s report examines the intersection of AI
adoption and cyber readiness, and the emerging
disparities that innovation creates. On the
geopolitical front, fragmentation and sovereignty

concerns are reshaping cooperation and trust
among nations. Hybrid threats and escalating
cyberattacks reflect the increasing volatility of the
global environment. From an economic perspective,
unequal access to resources and expertise
continues to widen cyber inequity.

Ultimately, strengthening collective cyber
resilience has become both an economic and
a societal imperative. Cybersecurity is a frontier
where collaboration remains not only possible,
but powerful – a reminder that, even amid
fragmentation, economic strain and uncertainty,
collective action can drive progress for all.

These are three key trends that executives will
need to navigate in cybersecurity in 2026:

1.  **AI is supercharging the cyber arms race**
    AI is anticipated to be the most significant driver
    of change in cybersecurity in the year ahead,
    according to 94% of survey respondents
    (see Appendix: Methodology for more information
    about the survey).

    This growing recognition is translating into concrete
    action across organizations. The percentage of
    respondents assessing the security of AI tools has
    nearly doubled from the previous year, from 37%
    in 2025 to 64% in 2026.

    ![Image description: A bar chart showing the percentage of organizations with processes in place to assess AI security, comparing 2025 and 2026. The 2026 bar shows 64% 'Yes' and 36% 'No', while the 2025 bar shows 37% 'Yes' and 63% 'No'.]

    At the same time, AI vulnerabilities are accelerating at an unprecedented pace:
    87% of respondents identified AI-related vulnerabilities as the fastest-growing
    cyber risk over the course of 2025.

    ![Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the perception of increase, decrease, or neutrality in various cyber risks over the past year. AI vulnerabilities show the highest 'Increase' percentage at 87%.]

2.  **Geopolitics is a defining feature of cybersecurity**
    In 2026, geopolitics remains the top factor influencing overall cyber risk mitigation
    strategies. Some 64% of organizations are accounting for geopolitically motivated
    cyberattacks – such as disruption of critical infrastructure or espionage.

    ![Image description: A bar chart showing the top considerations for cyber risk mitigation strategies, with 'Geopolitically motivated cyberattacks' being the highest at 64%.]

    Notably, 91% of the largest organizations¹ have changed their cybersecurity
    strategies due to geopolitical volatility.

    ![Image description: A comparison bar chart showing how organizations have adapted cybersecurity strategies amid geopolitical volatility, segmented by employee count. Organizations with >100,000 employees show 91% 'Yes' to strategy evolution, while <1,000 employees show 41%.]

    In the context of geopolitical volatility, confidence
    in national cyber preparedness continues to erode,
    with 31% of survey respondents reporting low
    confidence in their nation’s ability to respond to
    major cyber incidents, up from 26% last year.
    Confidence levels vary greatly across regions.

    Respondents from the Middle East and North
    Africa express a high degree of confidence
    in their country’s ability to protect critical
    infrastructure (84%), while confidence is lower
    among respondents in Latin America and the
    Caribbean (13%).

    ![Image description: A regional overview bar chart showing confidence in national cyber response to critical infrastructure attacks. Middle East and North Africa shows 84% 'Confident', while Latin America and the Caribbean shows 13%.]

    Recent incidents affecting key infrastructure, such as airports and hydroelectric
    facilities, continue to call attention to these concerns. Despite its central role
    in safeguarding critical infrastructure, the public sector reports markedly lower
    confidence in national preparedness.

    Some 23% of public-sector organizations reported having insufficient cyber-
    resilience capabilities.

    ![Image description: A bar chart showing the perception of insufficient cyber resilience by sector, with the public sector reporting 23% and the private sector reporting 11%.]

3.  **Cyber-enabled fraud is threatening CEOs and households alike**
    In the survey, 73% of respondents reported that they or someone in their network
    had been personally affected by cyber-enabled fraud over the course of 2025.

    ![Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the prevalence of cyber-enabled fraud, with 'Yes, phishing, vishing or smishing attacks' being the highest at 73%.]

    Chief executive officers (CEOs) rate cyber-enabled
    fraud as their top concern, shifting focus from
    ransomware to emerging risks such as cyber-
    enabled fraud and AI vulnerabilities. Chief information

    security officers (CISOs), by contrast, remain
    concerned about ransomware and supply chain
    resilience. This reflects how cybersecurity priorities
    diverge between the boardroom and the front line.

    ![Image description: A table ranking CEOs’ and CISOs’ cyber risk concerns for their organizations, comparing 2025 and 2026. It highlights shifts in CEO priorities and consistent CISO concerns.]

## 1 Five years of the Global Cybersecurity Outlook

In 2026, cybersecurity will continue to evolve
across technological, geopolitical, economic
and strategic dimensions.

Over the past year, cyberspace has become deeply
intertwined with geopolitics, the global economy
and the daily lives of individuals and institutions
alike. A new generation of cyber incidents has
exposed the fragility of these connections:
disruptions in retail and manufacturing chains,
aviation slowdowns, intrusions into public-sector
systems and hyperscale cloud outages. Each
event underscored how tightly interlinked the digital
ecosystem has become – where a single local fault
or targeted attack can rapidly cascade into global-
scale consequences.

In 2026, cybersecurity will continue to evolve across
technological, geopolitical, economic and strategic
dimensions. In this landscape, cybersecurity is no
longer a backroom technical function; it is a core
strategic concern for governments, businesses and
societies. The coming year will test not only global
technological preparedness but also the capacity to
align policy, ethics and collaboration in defending
an increasingly digital world.

Over the past five years, the Global Cybersecurity
Outlook has traced the developments in risks
related to the digital landscape – from the
urgency of the pandemic-driven digitalization to
today’s environment of accelerating complexity,
fragmentation and technological transformation.

The 2022 edition captured a world adapting to
unprecedented connectivity. As organizations raced
to digitize operations during the COVID-19 pandemic,
the report warned of widening capability gaps that
left smaller institutions and nations struggling to
defend their increasingly digital infrastructure.

By 2023, cyber risk had become inseparable
from geopolitics. The report documented how
escalating geopolitical instability and supply chain
interdependencies reshaped corporate priorities.

The 2024 edition described a world of polarization
and uneven progress. The cybersecurity economy
grew faster than the global economy, but this growth
masked deepening cyber inequity between resilient,
well-resourced organizations and those falling behind.

In 2025, the fourth edition found that a series
of compounding factors – geopolitical tension,
intricate supply chains, regulatory proliferation and
rapid technological adoption – were creating an era
of escalating complexity and unpredictability.

Across these four years and leading into the fifth,
one theme stands out: collaboration has become
indispensable in a fragmented world facing rising
threats, a widening tech divide and growing inequity
that risk deepening the cyber resilience gap.

## 2 The view from the top: CEOs’ priorities in a shifting cyber landscape

The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026 survey
gathered insights from more than 100 CEOs
across industries and regions. Their responses
offer a unique lens into how leaders perceive
the evolving cyber landscape.

### Threat landscape

Cyber-enabled fraud is CEOs’ top concern,
while ransomware remains the primary
concern for CISOs

In 2025, CEOs were most concerned about
ransomware attacks, followed by cyber-
enabled fraud. In 2026, their priorities shifted,

with cyber-enabled fraud and phishing taking
the top spot and AI vulnerabilities emerging
second. For CISOs, the top risks showed strong
continuity, with ransomware attacks remaining
the leading concern and supply chain disruption
consistently holding second place across both
years. This suggests CEOs are prioritizing
financial loss prevention and preparing for
new threats, while CISOs remain focused
on operational resilience.

![Image description: A table ranking CEOs’ and CISOs’ cyber risk concerns for their organizations, comparing 2025 and 2026.]

CEOs of highly resilient companies are
concerned about AI vulnerabilities

Cyber-enabled fraud and phishing remain the top
cybersecurity concerns for CEOs of insufficiently
resilient organizations. However, as resilience

strengthens, risk perception shifts towards
emerging threats: among CEOs of highly resilient
organizations, AI-related vulnerabilities rise to the
top. This suggests that resilient organizations
are more attuned to the evolving risks posed
by advanced technologies.

![Image description: A table showing CEO survey responses, segmented by organizational resilience level, ranking their top cyber risk concerns.]

### AI risks

Data leaks and advancement of adversarial capabilities dominate CEOs’
concerns about generative AI

CEOs identify data leaks (30%) and the advancement of adversarial capabilities
(28%) as the most significant security concerns related to generative AI (genAI).
These two risks stand out clearly above others, indicating that exposure of
proprietary data through genAI and the growing sophistication of cyber attackers
are the primary issues on CEOs’ radars for 2026.

![Image description: A bar chart showing CEOs’ perception of key AI security risks, with 'Data leaks' at 30% and 'Advancement of adversarial capabilities' at 28%.]

### Geopolitics

Private-sector CEOs question national readiness for major cyberattacks
on critical infrastructure

Less than 45% of all CEOs from the private sector are confident in their country’s
ability to respond to major cyber incidents targeting critical infrastructure.

![Image description: A bar chart showing CEOs’ confidence in national responses to cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, with 43% 'Confident', 26% 'Neutral', and 31% 'Not confident'.]

"Cybersecurity is the foundation for our digital world. It is at the heart of trust
and will allow society to fully benefit from the transformations enabled by new
technologies like AI and quantum. But it’s not something one can do on their own.
We have to come together, share intelligence globally and develop the skills equal
to emerging risks. Society knows what’s at stake if we get this wrong. It’s critical
that we get it right. If we do, we’ll be able to deliver on the many possibilities for
so many people around the world."

Michael Miebach, Chief Executive Officer, Mastercard

CEOs of highly resilient organizations prioritize
threat intelligence and information sharing to
address geopolitical volatility

Some 52% of CEOs of highly resilient
organizations are prioritizing threat intelligence
on nation-state actors, compared to 13% of
CEOs of insufficiently resilient organizations.

Similarly, 48% of CEOs of highly resilient
organizations are increasing collaboration
with government agencies and information-
sharing groups, whereas only 6% of CEOs of
insufficiently resilient organizations report doing
so. This indicates that resilience is no longer
built in isolation. It is achieved through shared
intelligence and partnerships.

![Image description: A stacked bar chart comparing CEOs of highly resilient and insufficiently resilient organizations on their cybersecurity strategy evolution amid geopolitical volatility, highlighting increased focus on threat intelligence and government engagement for highly resilient organizations.]

### Resilience

CEOs of highly resilient organizations cite
external ecosystem risks as the top challenge
to cyber resilience, while less resilient peers
point to funding and skills shortages

As organizational resilience improves, CEOs increasingly
shift their attention from internal resource constraints,

such as funding or skills shortages, to broader
ecosystem risks. In the survey, 78% of CEOs of highly
resilient organizations identify supply chain and third-
party dependencies as the most significant challenge
to further strengthening resilience. On the other hand,
cybersecurity skills shortage (56%) and lack of funds
(63%) were the top challenges identified by CEOs of
insufficiently resilient organizations to improve their
cyber resilience.

![Image description: A grouped bar chart showing CEOs’ greatest challenge to becoming cyber resilient, segmented by organizational resilience level. Highly resilient organizations focus on third-party and supply chain vulnerabilities, while insufficiently resilient organizations focus on lack of funds and cybersecurity skills shortage.]

### Supply chain

CEOs of highly resilient organizations integrate security into
their procurement process to address supply chain risk

CEOs of highly resilient organizations integrate security into
their procurement process (70%) and prioritize supplier-maturity
assessments (59%) to address supply chain risk.

![Image description: A stacked bar chart comparing CEO approaches to supply chain risk management by organizational resilience level, showing higher engagement in security integration and supplier assessment for highly resilient organizations.]

### Inequity

CEOs from sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean face
the greatest cyber skills shortages

Outside of Europe and North America, more than half of CEOs admit lacking
the skills to achieve current cybersecurity goals, with sub-Saharan Africa
(70%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (69%) facing the greatest gaps.

![Image description: A regional overview bar chart showing CEOs’ views on whether their organization’s workforce has the skills for current cybersecurity objectives. Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean show the highest percentages of 'No, we are missing critical people and skills'.]

## 3 The trends reshaping cybersecurity

As organizations confront AI threats, geopolitical
volatility and supply chain vulnerabilities,
the need for resilience has never been clearer.

### 3.1 AI is reshaping risk, accelerating
both offence and defence

Developments in AI are reshaping multiple domains, including cybersecurity.
Implemented well, these technologies can assist and support human operators
in detecting, defending and responding to cyberthreats. However, they can also
pose serious risks such as data leaks, cyberattacks and online harms if they
malfunction, or are misused. Governments must take a forward-looking, practical
and collaborative approach to developing and using emerging technologies safely,
as their capabilities and risks continue to evolve. The risks transcend borders,
and the challenge is to maximize AI’s benefits, including to strengthen our cyber
resilience, while minimizing its risks.

Josephine Teo, Minister for Digital Development and Information and Minister-in-Charge
of Cybersecurity and Smart Nation Group, Singapore

AI is anticipated to be the most significant driver
of change in cybersecurity in the year ahead,
according to 94% of survey respondents. AI is
reshaping the cybersecurity landscape across three
interconnected dimensions. First, the widespread
integration of AI systems introduces an expanded
attack surface, creating novel vulnerabilities that
traditional controls were not designed to address.
Second, defenders are harnessing AI to strengthen
their cyber capabilities – augmenting detection,
accelerating incident response and automating
high-volume analytical tasks. Third, threat actors

are leveraging AI to enhance the scale, speed,
sophistication and precision of their attacks, driving
a new generation of automated exploitation and
targeted social engineering (see Section 3.3).

Together, these dynamics illustrate the dual-
use nature of AI, both as a force multiplier for
defence and as a catalyst for attackers. As this
technological competition intensifies, organizations
are shifting from reactive to proactive security, while
reassessing governance, validation and oversight at
every stage of AI adoption.

![Image description: A diagram illustrating the impacts of AI on cybersecurity, showing 'Wider attack surface and cyber harms to enterprise', 'More potent cyberattacks', and 'Enhanced cyber defence tools'.]

AI’s benefits are contingent on disciplined
execution. Poorly implemented solutions can
introduce new risks – misconfiguration, biased
decision-making, over-reliance on automation
and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation –
unless organizations embed robust guardrails,
security-by-design practices and continuous
monitoring. The implication is clear: AI can improve
cybersecurity, but only when deployed within
sound governance frameworks that keep human

judgement at the centre. At the same time, too
many controls can create friction, so it is essential
to strike a careful balance.

### Security of AI: from awareness to action

According to the Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026
survey, 87% of respondents identified AI-related
vulnerabilities as the fastest-growing cyber risk over
the course of 2025.

![Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the perception of increase, decrease, or neutrality in various cyber risks over the past year. AI vulnerabilities show the highest 'Increase' percentage at 87%.]

Data leaks associated with genAI (34%) and the
advancement of adversarial capabilities (29%)
stand out as leading concerns for 2026. This marks
a striking reversal from previous years – in 2025,
advancement of adversarial capabilities topped
the list at 47% compared to only 22% for data
leaks associated with genAI. The shift underscores

a turning point in the AI risk landscape for the
upcoming year: while the “AI arms race” between
attackers and defenders continues to intensify,
attention is pivoting from purely offensive innovation
with AI towards the unintended exposure and
misuse of sensitive data through generative and
agentic systems.

![Image description: A grouped bar chart showing top concerns related to genAI for 2026, 2025, and 2024. For 2026, 'Data leaks' is 34% and 'Advancement of adversarial capabilities' is 29%.]

Growing awareness of AI-related cybersecurity risks
is reflected in the increasing focus on the secure
use of AI. The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025
highlighted a significant gap between the widespread
recognition of AI-driven risks and the rapid adoption
of AI technologies without adequate safeguards. By

2026, however, this picture is changing: the share
of organizations assessing the security of their AI
tools has nearly doubled – from 37% in 2025 to
64% in 2026 – indicating that more organizations are
introducing structured processes and governance
models to manage AI securely and responsibly.

![Image description: A bar chart showing the percentage of organizations with processes in place to assess AI security, comparing 2025 and 2026. The 2026 bar shows 64% 'Yes' and 36% 'No', while the 2025 bar shows 37% 'Yes' and 63% 'No'.]

![Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the frequency of AI security assessments in organizations, with 'Yes, we review periodically' at 40% and 'Yes, we review once' at 24%.]

In the 2026 survey, 40% of organizations reported
conducting periodic reviews of their AI tools before
deploying them, rather than only doing a one-time
assessment (24%) – a clear sign of progress towards
continuous assurance. However, roughly one-third
still lack any process to validate AI security before
deployment, leaving systemic exposures even as the
race to adopt AI in cyber defences accelerates.

The market’s drive to adopt new AI features often
outpaces security readiness, creating exploitable
vulnerabilities.3 In response to these emerging

risks, a number of fundamental measures should
be prioritized to secure AI at the infrastructure
level. This includes protecting the data used in
the training and customization of AI models from
breaches and unauthorized access. AI systems
should be developed with security as a core
principle, incorporating regular updates and
patches to address potential vulnerabilities. It is
also critical for organizations to deploy robust
authentication and encryption protocols to
ensure the protection of customer interactions
and data.4

### BOX 1: The widespread adoption of AI agents

As AI agents become more widely adopted, they
are poised to transform how digital systems are
designed and developed. AI agents can enhance
efficiency, responsiveness and scalability by
automating complex or repetitive activities with
speed and consistency, but their integration
can challenge traditional security frameworks,
redefining roles and processes, while raising
fundamental questions about decision-making
and the prioritization of alerts.

The multiplication of identities and connections
makes managing their credentials, permissions and

interactions just as critical – and likely even more
complex – as managing those of human users. As
outlined in the World Economic Forum’s report AI
Agents in Action: Foundations for Evaluation and
Governance, without strong governance, agents can
accumulate excessive privileges, be manipulated
through design flaws or prompt injections, or
inadvertently propagate errors and vulnerabilities
at scale. Their speed and persistence amplify
these risks, underscoring the need for continuous
verification, audit trails and robust accountability
structures grounded in zero-trust principles that
treat every interaction as untrusted by default.5

### AI for cybersecurity

AI is fundamentally transforming security operations
– accelerating detection, triage and response
while automating labour-intensive tasks such as
log analysis and compliance reporting. AI’s ability
to process vast datasets and identify patterns at

speed positions it as a competitive advantage for
organizations seeking to stay ahead of increasingly
sophisticated cyberthreats. The survey data
reveals that 77% of organizations have adopted
AI for cybersecurity, primarily to enhance phishing
detection (52%), intrusion and anomaly response
(46%) and user-behaviour analytics (40%).

![Image description: A stacked bar chart showing how organizations are implementing AI for cybersecurity, with 'Yes, for phishing and email threat detection' at 52% and 'Yes, to detect and respond to intrusions or anomalies' at 46%.]

Addressing the practical challenges of AI
adoption in cybersecurity, organizations
consistently identify insufficient knowledge and/
or skills (54%) to deploy AI for cybersecurity, the

need for human oversight (41%) and uncertainty
about risk (39%) as the main hurdles. These
findings indicate that trust is still a barrier to
widespread AI adoption.

"Criminals are always willing to use all possible ways to get access to value,
much of which is contained in the cyber infrastructure. Consequently, to
stay ahead, those of us who defend must use every tool at our disposal –
which now includes agentic AI."

Arvind Krishna, Chief Executive Officer, IBM

![Image description: A grouped bar chart showing barriers in AI implementation for cybersecurity, with 'Insufﬁcient knowledge and/or skills' at 54% and 'AI-generated security responses must be validated by a human before implementing' at 41%.]

As organizations navigate the integration of AI into
their security operations, the balance between
automation and human judgement becomes
increasingly critical. While AI excels at automating
repetitive, high-volume tasks, its current limitations
in contextual judgement and strategic decision-
making remain clear. Over-reliance on ungoverned
automation risks creating blind spots that
adversaries may exploit.

The priorities for organizations are clear: invest
in AI literacy and secure-use skills, and embed
governance and validation, without creating new
single points of failure. A collaborative model,
anchored in security-by-design principles, emerges
as the recommended path forward – enabling
organizations to harness AI’s advantages while
mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring innovation
strengthens, rather than compromises, cybersecurity.

This evolving dynamic is reshaping the role of
cybersecurity professionals, highlighting the
importance of adapting skill sets to meet new
demands. According to the World Economic
Forum’s The Future of Jobs Report 2025,
“networks and cybersecurity” are among the top
three fastest-growing skills projected for 2030 –
alongside AI and big data and technological
literacy – reinforcing the urgency for targeted
upskilling and continuous learning.6

Rather than replacing human expertise, AI is
enabling specialists to shift their focus towards
strategic oversight, governance and policy
while delegating routine operational tasks to
automation. This transition demands new skill
sets, blending technical proficiency with strategic
and ethical considerations, and underscores
the growing importance of AI literacy across
security teams.

### How industries are adopting AI for cybersecurity

The adoption of AI tools to augment cybersecurity
capabilities varies across industries, reflecting sector-
specific risk profiles and operational needs. The
energy sector emphasizes intrusion and anomaly
detection (according to 69% of respondents who
have implemented AI for cybersecurity); the materials
and infrastructure sector prioritizes phishing
protection (80%); and the manufacturing, supply
chain and transportation sector reports greater use
of automated security operations (59%). These
differences not only reflect sectoral risk profiles and
operating constraints but also collectively point to
a maturing portfolio of AI-enabled cyber defence
capabilities that spans detection, intelligence,
analytics and orchestrated cyber defence.

The differences in AI adoption for cybersecurity will
be analysed in Section 3.6.

![Image description: A grouped bar chart showing the use cases of AI for cyber defence across industries, illustrating variations in adoption for different AI applications.]

### 3.2 Geopolitics is a defining feature of cybersecurity

In an increasingly fragmented global environment –
marked by conflicts, geoeconomic tensions,
trade wars, sanctions and growing technological
competition – geopolitics has become a defining
force shaping cybersecurity.

The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026 survey data
reveals that, although the percentage of organizations

changing their cybersecurity strategy due to
geopolitics has declined from 93% in 2023 to 66%
in 2026, geopolitics remains the top factor influencing
overall cyber risk mitigation strategies. This suggests
that the initial wave of adaptations following the
geopolitical turmoil that dominated the headlines in
2022 and 2023 has passed, and that geopolitical
risk is now a major factor shaping cyber defence.

![Image description: A line chart showing the year-over-year evolution of cybersecurity strategy shifts due to geopolitical volatility, indicating a decline in 'Yes' responses from 2023 to 2026.]

![Image description: A bar chart showing the top considerations for cyber risk mitigation strategies, with 'Geopolitically motivated cyberattacks' being the highest at 64%.]

Organizations are increasingly shifting from isolated
defence to intelligence-driven collaboration.
In response to geopolitical volatility, survey
respondents identified a stronger focus on
threat intelligence and deeper engagement with

government agencies as the top two drivers of
change in their cybersecurity strategies. This trend
indicates a growing recognition that navigating
an uncertain geopolitical landscape demands
collaboration and shared situational awareness.

![Image description: A stacked bar chart showing aspects of shifting cybersecurity strategy due to geopolitical volatility, with 'Increased focus on threat intelligence' and 'Increased engagement with government agencies' being the highest responses.]

The shift towards intelligence-driven collaboration
is being led primarily by global organizations with
a larger number of employees, which are inherently
more exposed to geopolitical volatility due to their
global operations. These large employers are
proactively seeking greater collaboration to manage
this heightened exposure – leveraging their scale
and resources to strengthen resilience.

Data shows that 70% of the largest employers (those
with more than 100,000 employees) have increased
their focus on threat intelligence, compared to

only 30% of small employers (those with 1,000
employees or fewer).7 Similarly, 49% of these large
employers have deepened their engagement with
government agencies or information-sharing groups,
versus 26% of small employers. In contrast, those
smaller organizations, with limited staff and narrower
geographic footprints, appear to be less aware of
direct geopolitical pressures and often have less
capacity to participate in collective security efforts.
This may mean relying more frequently on risk
acceptance rather than active mitigation in response
to geopolitical volatility.

![Image description: A grouped bar chart comparing strategy shifts due to geopolitical volatility among small and very large employers, highlighting higher percentages for threat intelligence and government engagement among very large employers.]

Geopolitical
tensions
particularly expose
threats and
vulnerabilities in
the critical national
infrastructure that
supports society
and underpins
the operations
of countless
organizations.

### Local events – global impact

Geopolitical instability and armed conflicts are
reshaping the cyberthreat landscape, creating
complex and unpredictable conditions for
organizations. As global fragmentation deepens –
driven by conflicts, sanctions and technological
rivalry – cybersecurity is emerging as a critical
extension of geopolitical competition.

The large-scale power outage experienced in the
Iberian Peninsula, while not in itself the result of a
cyberattack, highlighted the impact a cyberattack
could have on such critical national infrastructure.
Ongoing instability in the wake of the war in Ukraine
has coincided with a rise in hybrid attacks, using
drones to target European airports and other critical
infrastructure, along with the spread of disinformation,
which have further destabilized the regional security
landscape.8 Beyond Europe, escalating geopolitical
rivalries and conflicts across the Indo-Pacific, Middle
East and Africa require organizations to maintain
heightened vigilance as risks intensify across regions
and industries. Of particular concern to participants
in focus groups for this report was the use of
advanced offensive cyber capabilities by nation-state
actors to hack telecommunications networks in the United States.9,10,11

The shift to a paradigm of more global confrontation –
for example, by using trade policies, including tariffs
and export restrictions – is reshaping alliances and
technology dependencies. Political tensions are
contributing to a growing fragmentation of global
technology ecosystems, as countries diversify
their partnerships and supply chains. Political and
economic tensions are also driving countries and
corporations to reconfigure supply chains, reshore
manufacturing and cultivate “trusted” regional
partners. The rush to establish alternative suppliers,
logistics channels or data-hosting arrangements
often outpaces cyber due diligence, expanding
the attack surface across less-secure networks
and third parties. As tariffs and policy shifts ripple
through industries, cybersecurity risk management
must evolve in tandem – treating trade disruptions
as triggers for renewed threat modelling and
vendor-risk reassessment.12

In this volatile environment, cyber operations
have become tools of diplomacy and influence –
used to shape political outcomes and disrupt
trade – further reinforcing the link between
geopolitical uncertainty and organizational cyber
risk exposure. Although geopolitical volatility
continues to weigh on strategic decision-
making, a concerning trend has emerged:
reductions in cybersecurity budgets that may
constrain organizational capacity to manage
growing threats. Survey data shows that 12% of
organizations based in North America and 13%
of organizations based in Latin America and the
Caribbean have reported cutting cybersecurity
budgets due to geopolitical volatility.

As state-sponsored attacks and espionage
campaigns intensify, organizations face mounting
challenges in forecasting cyber risks and
aligning strategies with shifting global conditions.
Participants in focus group interviews for this report
warn that these pressures will persist, reinforcing
the need for adaptive, resilient cyber strategies
despite constrained budgets.

### Geopolitical tensions driving critical
infrastructure vulnerabilities

Geopolitical tensions particularly expose
threats and vulnerabilities in the critical national
infrastructure that supports society and underpins
the operations of countless organizations. Sectors
such as energy, water and transportation are
increasingly targeted in cyber warfare campaigns,
where the interconnected nature of systems
amplifies the impact of disruptions. A striking
illustration came in April 2025 when a Norwegian
hydropower dam was hacked, opening a floodgate
and releasing 500 litres of water per second for four
hours, in what officials described as a deliberate act
of sabotage.13

Alarmingly, 31% of the Global Cybersecurity Outlook
survey participants express lack of confidence in
their nation’s ability to respond effectively to major
cyber incidents, which is up from 26% last year.
This indicates a growing sense of uncertainty and
heightened exposure.

Respondents’ perceptions of their country’s
ability to protect critical national infrastructure
vary significantly across regions. While a high
degree of confidence is expressed by respondents

from the Middle East and North Africa (84% of
respondents), far less confidence is expressed
by respondents based in Latin America and
the Caribbean (13%).

### BOX 2: Strengthening cyber readiness through coordinated national action

Saudi Arabia’s cybersecurity resilience is built on
