## Introduction
This Flexera 2022 Software Vulnerability & Threat Intelligence Report is based upon data from the 
Flexera Secunia Research Team who produces valuable advisories leveraged by users of Flexera’s 
Software Vulnerability Research and Software Vulnerability Manager solutions. 
The report analyzes the evolution of software security from a vulnerability, threat intelligence and 
patch perspective. 
The report presents global data on the prevalence of vulnerabilities, exploits, the availability of 
patches and maps the security threats to IT infrastructures. 
What does the report cover? 
The annual Vulnerability Review is based on data from Flexera's Secunia Research. Secunia Research 
monitors more than 66,000 applications, appliances and operating systems, and tests and verifies 
the vulnerabilities reported in them. 
The systems and applications monitored by Secunia Research are in use in the environments of the 
customers of Flexera Software Vulnerability Management solutions. 
The vulnerability database covers vulnerabilities that can be exploited in all types of products, 
including software, hardware and firmware. 
The vulnerabilities verified by Secunia Research are described in Secunia Advisories and listed in  
the Flexera Vulnerability Database, detailing what IT security teams need to know to mitigate the 
vulnerability risk posed in their environments. The Secunia Advisory descriptions include criticality, 
attack vector, exploitability and solution status. 
How do we count vulnerabilities? 
Research houses in the vulnerability management space adopt different approaches to counting 
vulnerabilities. 
Secunia Research counts vulnerabilities per product in which the vulnerability appears. We apply this 
method to reflect the level of information our customers need to keep their environments secure. 
We provide verified intelligence listing all products affected by a given vulnerability.

Secunia Research Software Vulnerability tracking process 
A vulnerability is an error in software which can be exploited with a security impact and gain. 
Secunia Research validates, verifies and tests vulnerability information to author security advisories 
which provide valuable details by following consistent and standard processes that have been 
refined over the years. 
Whenever a new vulnerability is reported, it’s verified and a Secunia Advisory is published. A Secunia 
Advisory provides details, including description of the vulnerability, risk rating, impact, attack vector, 
recommended mitigation, credits, references and more, including additional details discovered 
during verification and testing, thus providing the information required to make appropriate 
decisions about how to protect systems.

## 2022 summary
Total advisories: 7,097 ↑ (2021 : 6,153) 
2022 was a busy year for cybersecurity, a record-breaking number of advisories were reported, and 
many significant vulnerabilities were the cause of data breaches, ransomware attacks and other 
types of threats. 
Top 3 most critical vulnerabilities: 
1. Log4Shell/Log4j (CVE-2021-44228), even with its disclosure in December 2021, many 
organizations are still struggling to identify and patch the vulnerability.  
2. Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965), still many systems remain unpatched despite the risk. 
3. ProxyNotShell (CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082) in Exchange 
Interesting facts and trends: 
- 2022 is the year with the most recorded Secunia Advisories since 2002 
- Average threat score of 2022: 13.66 (click here to learn how we calculate this) 
- Average CVSS3 score of 2022: 7.35  
- Fewer extreme critical advisories have been reported in 2022: 44 (2021: 60) 
- 85 advisories reported a zero-day vulnerability (2021: 81)  
- More than 50 percent of all advisories are for vulnerabilities in Unix/Linux operating systems  
- More than 50 percent of all rejected advisories are also for Unix/Linux operating systems 
- Almost 79 percent of all networking-related advisories are for Cisco, NetApp and Juniper 
- About Microsoft: 
    - Four percent of all advisories were for Microsoft, which put them in eighth place  
    in vendor ranking 
    - More than 56 percent of all zero-days were related to Microsoft products (first place). 
- None of the top four vendors with the most advisories (SUSE, IBM, Red Hat, Ubuntu) had any 
zero-day reported in 2022

- Log4j: 
    - 131 advisories were related to Log4j  
    - Last advisory was released in November (eleven months later) for IBM Security QRadar 
SIEM 7.x 
    - 62 Log4j related advisories were linked to IBM products 
    - 33 of them were rejected advisories for various reasons, including “the respective product 
does not have the vulnerable log4j component...” 
- Less than 11 percent of all advisories had a high to critical threat score which means that there 
was evidence of exploitation 
- Using threat intelligence will help you prioritize what needs immediate patching 
Software Vulnerability and Patch Management are becoming increasingly important. Due to the 
ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, attacks on critical infrastructures in many countries are increasing. 
Back in 2019 (just before COVID-19), patching was recommended within 30 days (or 14 days for CVSS 
score of seven or higher). Right now, hackers can deploy exploits within one week and even within 
24 hours. This means organizations need even better prioritization to quickly patch vulnerabilities 
(especially those with associated threats).

## Advisories breakdown
### Compared to previous years
2022 total advisory count: 7,097 ↑ (2021 : 6,153) 
As expected, 2022 had the highest number of advisories since Secunia started writing these.

*1,108 advisories have received the “rejected” status which means in general that the vulnerability requires one or more 
violations of security best practices (e.g., product not securely configured or not used securely) or that it was “too weak  
of a gain” (e.g., administrative, local users already being too privileged so that additional gain becomes neglectable).

### Advisory criticality and attack vector
 
![Advisory criticality and attack vector chart]
More information about the variables used in the above charts: 
Attack vector (from where) 
Criticality (severity) 
Though not in the chart, Secunia Research also provides information about the impact or 
consequence when a vulnerability has been exploited. There are twelve values that can  
be used (most advisories have one or more). Read more here.

### Advisories and rejected advisories
 
![Advisories and rejected advisories chart]
### Rejected advisories
There are a lot of vulnerabilities posted to the National Vulnerability Database, by a lot of people 
and companies. They’re not always valid, they’re not always assigned proper criticality, and in some 
cases, a vulnerability may be legitimate but not provide the attacker any benefit.  
 
The Flexera Secunia Research team evaluates vulnerabilities from hundreds of sources, rescores 
them when necessary and even rejects vulnerabilities not worth your attention. Rejection advisories 
help you reduce the volume of vulnerabilities to be mitigated by helping you focus only on those 
that present reasonable risk to your environment.

An advisory may be rejected for many reasons; the most common are: 
- No reachability 
The vulnerability cannot be exploited because the affected systems cannot be reached  
by an attacker. 
- No gain 
The vulnerability may be reached, but without any gain for the attacker. 
- No exploitability 
The vulnerability cannot be exploited because, for example, policy forbids installation  
of the affected software. 
- Dependent on other 
The vulnerability cannot be exploited by itself but depends on another vulnerability  
being present.

## Addressing awareness with vulnerability insights
 
### Prevelance:
- How many systems would benefit from any given security update? 
- Does it pose a risk? Is it on all systems? Patch 
### Asset sensitivity:
- What systems would result in the most risk if compromised? 
- Is it a high-risk device? Patch 
### Criticality:
- The most popular method of thoughtful prioritization. 
- If exploited, how bad could it affect your security?  
Is it designated to be of a high criticality? Patch 
### Threat intelligence:
- The newest and most impactful method focuses  
on the likelihood of exploitation. 
- Is it likely to be exploited? Patch

### How do we know that more insights/data is needed?
Focusing on advisories with CVSS 7 or higher would address about 50 percent of exploits. Most exploits are 
CVSS scored between four and seven. Focusing on vulnerabilities for the top 20 vendors would address only 
about 20 percent. 
 
### Take away 1:
High and extreme critical advisories are not necessarily those presenting the most risk. Leverage 
threat intelligence to better prioritize what demands your most urgent attention. Create a scoring 
mechanism that considers multiple variables.

### Take away 2:
Most vulnerabilities have a patch available (typically within 24 hours after disclosure).

## Patching
Most of 2022’s vulnerabilities were vendor patched. In fact, most vulnerabilities are patched within 
24 hours after disclosure.  
 
The challenge remains that organizations don’t have full visibility or awareness when a vulnerability 
is disclosed (time to awareness). Another big challenge is time to remediation (the time from having 
this information, correlating that with your environment and initiating the process to get the 
software updated to a secure version).
