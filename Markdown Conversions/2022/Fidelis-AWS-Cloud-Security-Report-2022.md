# 2022 AWS CLOUD SECURITY REPORT

## INTRODUCTION

Cloud environments are increasingly complex, while threats continually evolve. This trend makes simplified cybersecurity imperative to meet both operations and compliance requirements. To close security gaps, organizations are looking for unified cybersecurity platforms to better manage complexity and maintain both visibility and control.

The 2022 AWS Cloud Security Report is based on a comprehensive survey of 578 cybersecurity professionals to reveal how AWS user organizations are responding to evolving cloud security threats, and what tools and best practices cybersecurity leaders prioritize as their cloud infrastructures mature.

Key survey findings include:

- Virtually all organizations in our survey have some public cloud footprint. While AWS is still the predominant cloud provider, a majority of organizations (87%) use two or more cloud providers.
- More than two of three organizations (67%) use between three to six different dashboards to configure cloud security policies, significantly increasing the cost and complexity of managing security across multi-cloud environments.
- Ninety-five percent of organizations agree that it would be helpful to have a single cloud security platform with a single dashboard to configure all policies needed to consistently and comprehensively protect data across their cloud footprint.
- Eighty-one percent of organizations have an intermediate to leading cloud maturity level.
- However, despite this growing maturity level with the cloud, consistent with previous years, 95% of security professionals are moderate to extremely concerned about the security of public clouds, signaling a need for adoption of better security tools and practices.
- Fifty-eight percent of organizations state that they will deploy a new cloud security solution in the coming year.

We would like to thank Fidelis Cybersecurity for supporting this important research.

We hope you find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts in securing your journey into the cloud.

Thank you,

## CLOUD DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES

Virtually all organizations now have some public cloud footprint. While AWS is still the predominant cloud provider, an overwhelming majority of organizations (87%) use two or more cloud providers.

However, the more cloud providers an organization uses, the more inherently complex the infrastructure becomes. The addition of multiple cloud-native security tools compounds challenges for security teams. These solutions add their proprietary methods and dashboards for policy/rule configuration, along with varying techniques and cadences for monitoring, reporting, and remediating security issues.

How many cloud providers does your organization currently use?

- One: 12%
- None: 1%
- Two: 40%
- Three: 24%
- More than three: 23%

## CLOUD SECURITY CONCERNS

Eighty-one percent of organizations have an intermediate to leading cloud maturity level. However, despite this growing maturity level with the cloud, consistent with previous years, 95% of security professionals are moderately to extremely concerned about the security of public clouds. This continued trend signals a critical need for cloud security solutions that keep pace with increasingly complex environments and evolving threat landscapes.

95% organizations are concerned about cloud security, which is consistent with the findings over the past three years.

How concerned are you about the security of public clouds?

- Slightly concerned: 5%
- Moderately concerned: 24%
- Very concerned: 41%
- Extremely concerned: 30%

## SECURITY DASHBOARDS

More than two of three organizations (67%) use between three to six different dashboards to configure cloud security policies, significantly increasing the cost and complexity of managing security across multi-cloud environments. Utilizing multiple configuration solutions also negatively impacts security posture, highlighting the need for comprehensive security solutions for multi and hybrid cloud deployments.

How many separate security solutions do your users have to access to configure the policies that secure your enterprise’s entire cloud footprint?

| Number of separate security solutions | 2021 | 2022 |
| :------------------------------------ | :--- | :--- |
| 1-2                                   | 18%  | 42%  |
| 3-4                                   | 25%  | 38%  |
| 5-6                                   | 7%   | 28%  |
| 7-8                                   | 6%   | 6%   |
| 9-10                                  | 2%   | 4%   |
| +10                                   | 17%  | 7%   |
