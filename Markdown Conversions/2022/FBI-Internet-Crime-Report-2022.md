# INTRODUCTION

Dear Reader,

Today’s cyber landscape has provided ample opportunities for criminals and adversaries to target U.S. networks, attack our critical infrastructure, hold our money and data for ransom, facilitate large-scale fraud schemes, and threaten our national security. At the FBI, we know “cyber risk is business risk” and “cyber security is national security.” There is no shortage of recent examples showing the wide-ranging economic and national security effects of cyber crimes. We have seen cyber threats emanate from around the world and witnessed the scope and sophistication of these scams and attacks deepen. As these threats increase, we continue to encourage victims to report cyber incidents and cyber-enabled frauds to the FBI so that we may impose risks and consequences on malicious cyber actors.

Because cyberattacks and cyber-enabled frauds continue to affect our everyday lives, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is critical to combatting the cyber threat. The IC3 serves as a public resource to submit reports of cyberattacks and incidents, which allows us to collect data, identify trends, and pursue the threat at hand. In 2022, the IC3 received 800,944 complaints, which is a 5 percent decrease from 2021. However, the potential total loss has grown from $6.9 billion in 2021 to more than $10.2 billion in 2022.

While the number of reported ransomware incidents has decreased, we know not everyone who has experienced a ransomware incident has reported to the IC3. As such, we assess ransomware remains a serious threat to the public and to our economy, and the FBI and our partners will remain focused on disrupting ransomware actors and increasing the risks of engaging in this activity. In concert, the public can play a crucial role by taking proactive measures to prevent and prepare for a potential cyber attack and, if there is an incident, by reporting it to the FBI through the IC3. Though cybercriminals are continuously seeking to make their attacks more resilient, more disruptive, and harder to counter, public reporting to the IC3 helps us gain a better understanding of the threats we face daily.

The FBI’s commitment to assisting victims of cyber crimes and cyber-enabled frauds, as well as our dedication to working with partners to combat these crimes, allows for continued success through programs such as the IC3’s Recovery Asset Team (RAT). Established in 2018, RAT streamlines communications with financial institutions and FBI field offices to assist freezing of funds for victims. In 2022, RAT initiated the Financial Fraud Kill Chain (FFKC) on 2,838 Business Email Compromise (BEC) complaints involving domestic-to-domestic transactions with potential losses of over $590 million. A monetary hold was placed on approximately $433 million, which represents a 73 percent success rate. In 2022, RAT saw a 64 percent increase in FFKCs initiated compared to 2021.

While the cyber threat is ever-growing, the FBI remains appreciative of those individuals and entities who report cyber incidents to the IC3, as that valuable information helps fill in gaps that are crucial to advancing our investigations. Your efforts are critical to our ability to pursue the perpetrators and share intelligence to protect your fellow citizens. Cyber is the ultimate team sport, and we are in this fight together. The FBI is relentlessly focused on promoting safety, security, and confidence into our digitally connected world, and we are eager to continue working with the American public to bring cybercriminals to justice around the globe.

# THE IC3

Today’s FBI is an intelligence-driven and threat focused national security organization with both intelligence and law enforcement responsibilities. We are focused on protecting the American people from terrorism, espionage, cyber-attacks, and major criminal threats which are increasingly emanating from our digitally connected world. To do that, the FBI leverages the IC3 as a mechanism to gather intelligence and internet crime so that we can support the public and our many partners with information, services, support, training, and leadership to stay ahead of the threat.

The IC3 was established in May 2000 to receive complaints crossing the spectrum of cyber matters, to include online fraud in its many forms including Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) matters, Computer Intrusions (Hacking), Economic Espionage (Theft of Trade Secrets), Online Extortion, International Money Laundering, Identity Theft, and a growing list of Internet facilitated crimes. As of December 31, 2022, the IC3 has received over seven million complaints. The IC3 mission to provide the public and our partners with a reliable and convenient reporting mechanism to submit information concerning suspected cyber-enabled criminal activity and to develop effective alliances with law enforcement and industry partners to help those who report. Information is analyzed and disseminated for investigative and intelligence purposes for law enforcement and public awareness.

The information submitted to the IC3 can be impactful in the individual complaints, but it is most impactful and in the aggregate. That is, when these individual complaints are combined with other data, it allows the FBI to connect complaints, investigate reported crimes, track trends and threats, and, in some cases, even freeze stolen funds. Just as importantly, the IC3 shares reports of crime throughout its vast network of FBI field offices and law enforcement partners, strengthening our nation’s collective response both locally and nationally.

To promote public awareness and as part of its prevention mission, the IC3 aggregates the submitted data and produces an annual report on the trends impacting the public as well as routinely providing intelligence reports about trends. The success of these efforts is directly related to the quality of the data submitted by the public through the public, www.ic3.gov interface. Their efforts help the IC3, and the FBI better protect their fellow citizens.

# THE IC3 RECOVERY ASSET TEAM (RAT)

The Internet Crime Complaint Center’s Recovery Asset Team (RAT) was established in February 2018 to streamline communication with financial institutions and assist FBI field offices with the freezing of funds for victims who made transfers to domestic accounts under fraudulent pretenses.

## RAT Process5

*   If criteria are met, transaction details are forwarded to the identified point of contact at the recipient bank to notify of fraudulent activity and request freezing of the account. Once response is received from the recipient bank, RAT contacts the appropriate FBI field office(s).

The RAT functions as a liaison between law enforcement and financial institutions supporting statistical and investigative analysis.

## Goals of RAT-Financial Institution Partnership

*   Assist in the identification of potentially fraudulent accounts across the sector.
*   Remain at the forefront of emerging trends among financial fraud schemes.
*   Foster a symbiotic relationship in which information is appropriately shared.

## Guidance for BEC Victims

*   Contact the originating financial institution as soon as fraud is recognized to request a recall or reversal and a Hold Harmless Letter or Letter of Indemnity.
*   File a detailed complaint with www.ic3.gov. It is vital the complaint contain all required data in provided fields, including banking information.
*   Visit www.ic3.gov for updated PSAs regarding BEC trends as well as other fraud schemes targeting specific populations, like trends targeting real estate, pre-paid cards, and W-2s, for example.
*   Never make any payment changes without verifying the change with the intended recipient; verify email addresses are accurate when checking email on a cell phone or other mobile device.

![Image description: Chart shows Success to Date to include 73% Success Rate; 2,838 Incidents; $590.62 Million in Losses; and $433.30 Million Frozen.]

The IC3 RAT has proven to be a valuable resource for field offices and victims. The following are two examples of the RAT’s successful contributions to investigative and recovery efforts:

### Seattle
In September 2022, the IC3 received a complaint filed by a victim located in the Seattle, Washington area of a BEC who intended a wire of $650,000.00 be sent to an investor, not realizing their email account was intercepted by a hacker providing fraudulent bank account instructions. The IC3 RAT immediately initiated the Financial Fraud Kill Chain (FFKC) process to freeze the fraudulent financial bank account. Further collaboration with the domestic financial institution enabled a full return to the business of approximately $645,000.00. The RAT team walked the victim through the recovery process which enabled the return of funds.

### Charlotte
In July 2022, the IC3 received notice from the Charlotte field office of an IC3 complaint filed by an attorney seeking assistance with a FFKC on behalf of his clients. The clients were in the process of purchasing a home and received a spoofed email from their supposed realtor instructing them to wire $400,000.00 to a financial institution for an escrow payment. Once the wire was initiated, it was realized the instructions came from a spoofed email. Upon notification, the IC3 requested a FFKC to the recipient bank. Further collaboration between the attorney and the Charlotte field office confirmed the full amount of $400,000.00 was returned to the victim, making a full recovery possible due to the FFKC process taken by RAT and the legitimate purchase of the home was able to be made.

# THREAT OVERVIEWS FOR 2022

## BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE (BEC)

In 2022, the IC3 received 21,832 BEC complaints with adjusted losses over $2.7 billion.
BEC is a sophisticated scam targeting both businesses and individuals performing transfers
of funds. The scam is frequently carried out when a subject compromises legitimate
business email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to
conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.

As fraudsters have become more sophisticated and preventative measures have been put in place, the BEC
scheme has continually evolved in kind. The scheme has evolved from simple hacking or spoofing of
business and personal email accounts and a request to send wire payments to fraudulent bank accounts.
These schemes historically involved compromised vendor emails, requests for W-2 information, targeting
of the real estate sector, and fraudulent requests for large amounts of gift cards. More recently, fraudsters
are more frequently utilizing custodial accounts held at financial institutions for cryptocurrency exchanges,
or having victims send funds directly to cryptocurrency platforms where funds are quickly dispersed.

In 2022, the IC3 also saw a slight increase of targeting victims’ investment accounts instead of the
traditional banking accounts. There was also an increasingly prevalent tactic by BEC bad actors of spoofing
legitimate business phone numbers to confirm fraudulent banking details with victims. For one example,
the victims report they have called a title company, realtor, etc., using a known phone number, and then
find later the phone number has been spoofed. With this increased tactic of “spoofed” phone numbers it
emphasizes the importance of leveraging two-factor or multi-factor authentication as an additional security
layer. Procedures should be put in place to verify payments and purchase requests outside of e-mail
communication and can include direct phone calls but to a known verified number and not relying on
information or phone numbers included in the e-mail communication. Other best practices include
carefully examining the email address, URL, and spelling used in any correspondence and not clicking on
anything in an unsolicited email or text message asking you to update or verify account information.

# INVESTMENT7

In 2022, investment scams were the costliest scheme reported to the IC3. Investment
fraud complaints increased from $1.45 billion in 2021 to $3.31 billion in 2022, which
is a 127%. Within those complaints, cryptocurrency investment fraud rose from $907
million in 2021 to $2.57 billion in 2022, an increase of 183%.

Crypto-investment scams saw unprecedented increases in the number of victims and the dollar
losses to these investors. Many victims have assumed massive debt to cover losses in
fraudulent investments and the most targeted age group reporting this type of scam are
victims ages 30 to 49. Some variations of crypto-investment scams reported in 2022 are:

*   **Liquidity Mining**: victims are enticed to link their cryptocurrency wallet to a fraudulent liquidity mining
    application. Scammers then wipe out the victims' funds without notification or permission from the
    victim. (PSA I-072122-PSA8).
*   **Hacked Social Media**: scammers used hacked social media accounts to perpetrate a fraudulent
    investment opportunity using cryptocurrency, targeting existing friends of the hacked user.
*   **Celebrity Impersonation**: impersonating a well-known celebrity or social figure, the scammers feign a
    friendship with the targeted victim who is eventually enticed to learn how to invest in cryptocurrency
    or is given the opportunity to invest by the scammer.
*   **Real Estate Professionals**: the scammer contacts a real estate agent, usually offering to buy a very
    expensive property for cash or cryptocurrency. Once engaged, the fraudster will expose their control
    of fictitious accounts with purported value of millions of dollars to entice them to engage in their
    investment scheme.
*   **Employment**: victims apply for fake positions online at an investment firm or company supposedly
    affiliated with investing. Instead of a job, the victims are instead offered advice investment advice.
    The investment is fraudulent and designed to retrieve as much money from the target as possible.

# RANSOMWARE9

In 2022, the IC3 received 2,385 complaints identified as ransomware with adjusted losses
of more than $34.3 million. Ransomware is a type of malicious software, or malware, that
encrypts data on a computer, making it unusable. In addition to encrypting the network,
the cyber-criminal will often steal data off the system and hold that data hostage until the
ransom is paid. If the ransom is not paid, the victim’s data remains unavailable.

Although cyber criminals use a variety of techniques to infect victims with ransomware, phishing emails,
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exploitation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities remained the top
initial infection vectors for ransomware incidents reported to the IC3. Once a ransomware threat actor has
gained code execution on a device or network access, they can deploy ransomware. In 2022, the IC3 has
seen an increase in an additional extortion tactic used to facilitate ransomware. The threat actors pressure
victims to pay by threatening to publish the stolen data if they do not pay the ransom.

## Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to
Protect Against Ransomware:

*   Update your operating system and software.
*   Implement user training and phishing exercises to raise awareness
    about the risks of suspicious links and attachments.
*   If you use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), secure and monitor it.
*   Make an offline backup of your data.
*   Use multifactor authentication (MFA).

## Incident reporting

Ransomware infections impact individual users and businesses regardless of size or industry by causing
service disruptions, financial loss, and in some cases, permanent loss of valuable data. While ransomware
infection statistics are often highlighted in the media and by computer security companies, it has been
challenging for the FBI to ascertain the true number of ransomware victims as many infections go
unreported to law enforcement. By reporting the incident, the FBI may be able to provide information on
decryption, recover stolen data, possible seizure/recovery of ransom payments, and gain insight on
adversary tactics. Ultimately, the information you provide will lead us to bring the perpetrators to justice.

## Ransomware and Critical Infrastructure Sectors

The IC3 received 870 complaints that indicated organizations belonging to a critical infrastructure sector
were victims of a ransomware attack. Of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, IC3 reporting indicated 14
sectors had at least 1 member that fell victim to a ransomware attack in 2022.10

lock bit, ALPHV/BlackCat, and Hive.

The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries
to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of
ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files
will be recovered. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI
urges you to report ransomware incidents to the IC3. Doing so provides investigators with the critical
information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. law, and prevent
future attacks.

# CALL CENTER FRAUD12

## TECH AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT/GOVERNMENT IMPERSONATION
Illegal call centers defraud thousands of victims each year. Two categories of fraud
reported to the IC3, Tech/Customer Support and Government Impersonation, are
responsible for over $1 billion in losses to victims.

| Category | Victims | Losses | Trend |
|---|---|---|---|
| Government Impersonation | 11,554 | $240,553,091 | 68% |
| Tech and Customer Support | 32,538 | $806,551,993 | 132% |
| **TOTAL** | **44,092** | **$1,047,105,083** |  |

Call centers overwhelmingly target
the elderly, with devastating
effects. Almost half the victims
report to be over 60 (46%), and
experience 69% of the losses (over
$724 million). To learn more about
these types of scams, please see
these Public 2022-published
Service Announcements on the IC3
website13 and recently published
podcast14 on FBI.gov15

The scams primarily emanate from call centers in South Asia, mainly India. In response to the increasing
victimization, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI are collaborating with law enforcement in India,
such as the Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi and local Indian states, to combat cyber-enabled
financial crimes and transnational call center fraud. The cooperation has secured the testimony of U.S.
victims of call center fraud for use in enforcement proceedings against the alleged perpetrators.

In 2022, with the assistance of U.S. law enforcement, Indian law enforcement accomplished multiple call
center raids, disruptions, seizures, and arrests of the individuals alleged to be involved in perpetrating these
cyber-enabled financial crimes and global telemarketing frauds.
