# Introduction
## A Note From Bill
As the world continued to 
grapple with the challenges 
of 2020, such as the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 
brought its own set of new 
challenges. Supply-chain 
woes in 2021 affected 
everything from healthcare, 
the automotive industry and 
cybersecurity to travel, retail 
and the food supply. 
The growing pains of the new work reality were evident as 
companies opting for a permanent shift to fully remote 
work often found their networks, employees and processes 
unprepared for the change. Many businesses that stayed 
with the traditional work model continued to make 
arrangements for employees to return to the office, only to 
find time and again that the pandemic had other plans.
Cybersecurity faced its own set of increased challenges 
in 2021. The year was bookended by two major incidents: 
the SolarWinds attack in December 2020 and the Log4j 
vulnerabilities in 2021. In between, ransomware rose 
dramatically, far surpassing the levels we found alarming 
in 2020. Most other attack types showed increases as well, 
including overall malware, which had been on a downward 
slide for years.
But while some may see these challenges and default to 
pessimism, doing so requires an impossibly narrow view of 
the preceding year — one which doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.
When I look back on 2021, I’m amazed at what was 
accomplished. SonicWall made key engineering and 
manufacturing changes, ensuring our partners and end users 
were largely unimpacted by supply-chain disruptions. We also 
completed the Gen 7 refresh of our next-generation firewalls, 
making our platform stronger, easier to use and more reliable, 
and unifying our portfolio across hardware, software and cloud. 
Businesses outside of cybersecurity also doubled 
their efforts to fight cybercrime. From mid-2020 to 
2021, the number of CEOs who said cybersecurity risks 
were the biggest threat to short-term growth nearly 
doubled, and corporate boards are increasingly forming 
cybersecurity committees. 
This has translated to increased funding: Global 
cybersecurity spending was projected to grow 12.4% by the 
end of 2021, twice as fast as in 2020.
At the government level, at least 45 U.S. states considered 
cybersecurity bills in 2021, up 18% from 2020. And the U.S., 
Japan, Australia, Germany and countless others passed 
measures strengthening national cybersecurity.
But perhaps most remarkable is the level of cooperation 2021 
brought. Governments are increasingly coordinating with 
business and education leaders on “whole-of-nation” efforts. 
In June, the Group of Seven (G7) called for greater 
accountability in countries harboring ransomware groups. 
And in October, leaders from 30 countries met to formulate 
an international response to cybercrime. Few enemies, in our 
time or any other, have prompted such a unified effort. 
There will be years that test us — and 2021 certainly did 
that — but it didn’t find us wanting. Instead, it found us, as 
a company, as an industry, as a civilization — innovating, 
fortifying, unifying. And while cybercriminals may have 
notched some battles this past year, in the end they 
spurred us on. If they want to win, they’ll have to take on all 
of us, together. 
In this spirit of cooperation, we’re pleased to share with you 
the 2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report — full of research 
on cybercriminal behavior, industry trends and insight on 
what 2022 might have in store.

## 2021: A Turning Point in the War on Ransomware
Five years ago, a debate erupted surrounding the infamous 
NotPetya cyberattack: Did it constitute an act of war?
This issue continued to be debated in the courts throughout 
2021, but on the battlefields of business networks around the 
world, cybercriminals were launching a full-bore offensive.
Ransomware climbed an unprecedented 105% in 2021, 
and the explosive growth of strategies such as double and 
even triple extortion ensured that these attacks were more 
successful than ever. But as cybercriminals have grown 
more sophisticated and successful, they’ve also grown 
more ruthless — many of the high-profile ransomware 
attacks in 2021 looked more like acts of war than ever before, 
endangering our food supply, our water supply, our fuel 
supply, our hospitals and our municipalities.
That the courts ultimately decided cyberattacks such 
as NotPetya do not, in fact, constitute acts of war is 
irrelevant: Fed up with cybercriminals growing rich off their 
constituents, leaders around the world — from the local level 
to the international stage — have brought the war to them.
The UN Cybersecurity Open-Ended Working Group in 
March 2021 endorsed a report containing cybersecurity 
recommendations, the first time that a process 
open to all countries has resulted in consensus on 
international cybersecurity.
In May 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a sweeping 
executive order on cybersecurity, which unifies 
cybersecurity standards across government agencies, 
emphasizes zero-trust principles and provides specific 
timelines for action. 
In July, INTERPOL held its forum on ransomware. Advising 
that effectively preventing and disrupting ransomware 
would require “adopting the same international collaboration 
used to fight terrorism, human trafficking or mafia groups,” 
the group called for police agencies worldwide to form a 
global coalition with industry partners to stop ransomware’s 
exponential growth.
But perhaps the biggest testament to the threat ransomware 
poses to national security is the involvement of the U.S. 
military. In an interview with The New York Times, U.S. 
Cyber Command head Gen. Paul M. Nakasone explained 
that, while he once saw ransomware as the responsibility 
of law enforcement, attacks such as Colonial Pipeline and 
JBS represented a big enough threat to the nation’s critical 
infrastructure to warrant a more aggressive approach. 
But this approach likely won’t include boots on the ground — 
an option that proves challenging given that a vast majority 
of these ransomware operators are in other countries, 
most of which are not U.S. allies and tend to only go after 
cybercriminals when it serves their agenda. 
While high-profile arrests of cybercriminals continue, such 
as the REvil takedown in early 2022, they have been largely 
ineffective in stemming the tide of ransomware itself. The 
amount of time and resources required for each bust means 
that the criminal justice system is unable to keep up with 
the huge number of ransomware operators. And due to the 
lucrative nature of ransomware, as soon as one group is 
taken down, new ones rise to fill the void.
Instead, this approach will look a lot like their most ruthless 
attacks on civilians: a direct assault on their infrastructure. 
Pressure on the U.S. government to deploy intelligence and 
military solutions to attack the servers, networks and more 
used for cybercrime, dissemination of stolen data on the 
dark web and storing cryptocurrency payments is growing.
While he refrained from giving details, Nakasone confirmed 
that the military has taken an offensive stance against 
ransomware groups. One known example is when Cyber 
Command assisted in the recovery of millions in ransom that 
Colonial Pipeline paid to attackers.
Though recoveries such as this have historically been rare, 
this may be the first in an emerging trend. A major factor 
credited in this recovery is the work of a recently formed 
Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force. In an interview 
with Reuters, a senior U.S. DOJ official said the formation 
of this task force “elevates investigations of ransomware 
attacks to a similar priority as terrorism.”
As the amount of media attention and government 
involvement in the wake of high-profile attacks increases, 
these groups have grown wary, with many laying low or 
disappearing altogether. This could lead to groups lowering 
ransom demands in hopes of flying under the radar and 
continuing to hack another day — which could contribute 
to fewer attacks if success no longer means netting a 
life-changing fortune for the entire syndicate.
In other words, in the end, the most lethal shots to 
ransomware may well be the ones that hit where it hurts 
most: the wallet.
### Cybersecurity is Infrastructure
On Nov. 15, U.S. Pres. Joe Biden signed into law the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. While the bulk of 
the $1.2 trillion investment targets the country’s crumbling 
bridges, tunnels, roads and railways, it also provides $2 
billion for cybersecurity, reaffirming the role of cybersecurity 
as part of the country’s 21st century infrastructure.
About half of that amount is set aside for the State, Local, 
Tribal and Territorial (SLTT) Cyber Grant Program and will 
be distributed over four years. The Act’s language offers 
much-needed guidance on the types of investments that 
governments are expected to make — specifically, firewalls 
(on-prem and virtual), secure mobile access (on-prem and 
virtual) and advanced software that provides endpoint threat 
detection and response. 
The legislation also earmarks $42.45 billion for the 
“Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment” initiative, which 
will expand grants available to underserved communities. 
This funding is expected to touch on local cybersecurity 
considerations as expansion will likely involve wireless 
communication and participation from local utilities (e.g., 
mobile, broadband).

### Beyond Ransomware: The Threat of BEC, Phishing and More
While ransomware attracted most of the headlines in 2021, 
the year’s data pointed to plenty of other areas of concern. 
Based on data collected by SonicWall Capture Labs threat 
researchers, while ransomware did make up the largest 
number of malware signatures detected, it amounted to only 
about a quarter of the total volume.
According to a recent report from Gartner, the percentage 
of respondents rating vulnerabilities as “very important” 
is higher than the percentage who assigned this rating 
to ransomware. Fortunately, increased awareness may 
translate to fewer successful attacks, as Ponemon Institute 
recently reported that unpatched vulnerabilities were a 
factor in more than half of all data breaches, and over 60% of 
those surveyed said they were unaware of vulnerabilities in 
their organization before they were breached.
A recent SonicWall-sponsored survey by Osterman 
Research painted a slightly different picture. This group of 
respondents ranked phishing attacks as their top concern 
(though, again, ransomware was a close second.) 
Nearly 2/3 of respondents also rated Business Email 
Compromise (BEC) attacks as an area of concern. While 
these attacks may not get the headlines that ransomware 
attacks do, according to the Internet Crime Complaint 
Center (IC3), BEC attacks are the costliest, with 19,369 
reports and a total loss of $1.8 billion in 2020 alone.
Due to the dangers posed by infrastructure attacks and 
leaks of sensitive data, ransomware may continue to be the 
focus of governments and law enforcement in the short 
term. But these trends are a good sign that as other attack 
types continue to grow and rise in severity, organizations are 
keeping an eye on the bigger picture.

# Supply Chain
## Supply-Chain Attacks Continue In 2021
In December 2020, American company SolarWinds 
confirmed that a version of its Orion product had been 
targeted via the company’s supply chain, kicking off a new 
era in supply-chain attacks.
These attacks, referred to as “supply-chain attacks” because 
they infiltrate the products or services of a trusted business 
partner instead of targeting a company directly, are by no 
means new: They date back to at least 2013, when American 
retailer Target was attacked via its HVAC supplier. But it 
wasn’t until NotPetya’s spread in 2017 that people really 
started to understand the widespread devastation that 
supply-chain attacks could wreak.
Five years later, a new crop of supply-chain attacks made 
their mark across 2021 — many not just threatening profits 
and business continuity, but striking directly at our daily lives. 
Here are some of the year’s worst:
### Accellion – Dec. 2020-Jan. 2021
A total of four major vulnerabilities were identified in 
American technology company Accellion’s FTA server, a 
file-transfer program. The first two, exploited in December 
2020, were quickly patched — but unbeknownst to Accellion 
at the time, two additional CVEs were being exploited 
through January. The attack spread to as many as 100 
of Accellion’s customers via the impacted FTA server. 
The hackers stole large quantities of sensitive personal 
information, which the Cl0p ransomware gang used to extort 
payment from the victims.
Perhaps as remarkable as the breach itself is the fact that 
it didn’t happen sooner: The FTA server in question was a 
20-year-old legacy product that advertised itself as a way to 
securely transfer sensitive files, and the fact that it has long 
been utilized by major players in governments, the insurance 
industry and the financial sector means it’s likely been an 
attractive target for a long time.
### Codecov – April 15, 2021
In April, software company Codecov became aware that 
attackers had compromised an uploader designed to 
deliver coverage data and product updates. This attack 
went undetected for more than two months, allowing the 
attackers to steal credentials and exfiltrate sensitive data 
from an unknown number of the company’s 29,000 clients — 
a list which included Proctor & Gamble, Atlassian, GoDaddy, 
The Washington Post and IBM.
### Kaseya – July 2, 2021
Just before the U.S. July 4 holiday, a massive ransomware 
campaign then called the “single biggest ransomware attack 
yet” came to light. By gaining access to American software 
company Kaseya’s VSA remote management and monitoring 
software, ransomware group REvil was able to impact 
Managed Service Providers (MSPs), and in turn, gain access 
to their clients. An estimated 1,500 organizations in at least 
17 countries were affected. 
### Python Package Index (PyPI) – July 29, 2021
In July, 11 Python packages hosted on open-source 
repository PyPI, the official third-party software repository 
for Python, were found to contain malicious code. Due to 
the fact that the malware packages were remarkably well 
hidden, the packages remained undetected for long enough 
to be downloaded over 41,000 times by developers from 
other organizations. These malicious files then stole Discord 
authentication tokens, scraped sensitive autocomplete data, 
and mined system information including IP address, user 
name, license key information and more.

# CVEs
## Published CVEs Break 20,000 for the First Time
According to NIST, 20,136 Common Vulnerabilities and 
Exposures (CVEs) were published in 2021. This marks the 
fifth year in a row that a record number of vulnerabilities has 
been discovered, and the first time in history that the number 
of CVEs has passed the 20,000 mark.
This isn’t necessarily a milestone to celebrate, however. 
While the number of vulnerabilities reflects the hard work 
those in the cybersecurity industry are doing to identify 
vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently, it also reflects 
pernicious trends that make quicker and more efficient work 
necessary in the first place.
One is the growing attack surface resulting from 
organizations deploying more software and tools as 
they continue their digital transformation. The more 
products a company utilizes, the more likely one of them 
will be vulnerable.
The most serious of these vulnerabilities, those scored 
above nine on the 10-point scale, become entry points for 
cybercriminals, and attackers are increasingly utilizing this 
means of entry to deploy ransomware and steal data.

## History Repeating: 80% of Top 10 Exploited Vulnerabilities Are From Previous Years
In July 2021, CISA released its list of top vulnerabilities 
exploited by cybercriminals in 2020. Each of the top ten most 
exploited vulnerabilities has a patch or an updated version 
available for devices — yet out of the top 10 vulnerabilities 
exploited in 2020, only two were actually discovered in 2020. 
The number of entirely preventable exploits once again 
highlights the need for more timely and widespread patching.
In addition, SonicWall identified a number of even older 
vulnerabilities being actively exploited, including CVE-2013-
3541, CVE-2016-1605, CVE-2014-6036 and many more.


