44462EXECUTIVE SUMMARYSecurity, IT, and other teams tasked with vulnerability management and risk 
reduction operate in high\-urgency, high\-stakes environments where informed 
decision\-making hinges on the ability to quickly find signal in a sea of perpetual 
noise. When a new potential threat emerges, information security professionals 
often find themselves needing to translate vague descriptions and untested 
research artifacts into actionable intelligence for their own particular risk models.Rapid7 researchers analyze thousands of 
vulnerabilities each year to understand root 
causes, dispel misconceptions, and share 
information on why certain flaws are more 
likely to be exploited than others.Rapid7s Vulnerability Intelligence Report examines notable vulnerabilities 
and high\-impact attacks from 2022 in order to highlight exploitation trends, 
explore attacker use cases, and offer a framework for understanding new 
security threats as they arise. Our aim is to contextualize the vulnerabilities 
that introduce serious risk to a wide range of organizations.The report examines 50 vulnerabilities that pose considerable risk to organizations 
of all sizes. In total, this report includes 45 vulnerabilities that were exploited in 
the wild in 2022, of which 44% arose from zero\-day exploits. See our appendix 
for additional context on vulnerability selection.32022 findings include:Widespread exploitation of new vulnerabilities decreased somewhat 
in 2022, but broad, opportunistic attacks still drove considerable risk. 
Rapid7s vulnerability research team tracked 28 net\-new widespread 
threats in 2022, a 15% decrease in widespread threats from 2021\.Zero\-day exploitation was still a significant threat in 2022, though 
we saw a modest decline in mass zero\-day attacks. 43% of the 
widespread threats Rapid7 researchers analyzed in 2022 began 
with a zero\-day exploit, down from 52% in 2021\.Attackers are still developing and deploying exploits faster than 
ever. 56% of the vulnerabilities in this report were exploited within 
seven days of public disclosure a 12% rise over 2021 and an 
87% rise over 2020\.Only 14 of the vulnerabilities in this report are known to have been 
exploited to carry out ransomware attacks a significant (33%) 
decrease from 2021 despite consistent ransomware activity. This 
may indicate that ransomware operations have become less reliant 
on new vulnerabilities, but it may also stem from other factors, like 
lower reporting of ransomware incidents.Other vulnerability and exploit trends examined in this report 
include ransomware ecosystem complexity, privilege escalation 
from the network perimeter, and the long tail of exploitation across 
older vulnerabilities.The full 2022 dataset is available in the appendix.4Big PictureThe past three years have witnessed a convergence of major attack trends 
that shaped the security landscape with blunt force. Zero\-day exploitation hit 
an all\-time high in 2021, ransomware business models matured and expanded 
with devastating effect, and organizations were plagued by widespread attacks 
on business\-critical technologies. For many, 2021 was a sledgehammer not 
always terribly sophisticated, but undeniably effective at distributing damage 
across a broad area.The security landscape in 2022 has been marked by more nuance. Zero\-day 
exploitation seems to have plateaued at high elevation, but zero\-day exploits 
morphed into mass exploitation events less frequently than they did in 2021\. 
The volume of ransomware incidents continued to rise, but there are fewer CVEs 
mapped directly to ransomware in our 2022 report data than there were in 2021\.55Finally, as always, we saw celebrity vulnerabilities and hotly anticipated security 
releases whose practical impact ended up being rather low but impracticality 
failed to deter attackers from indiscriminately lobbing exploits at internet\-
accessible targets, searching in vain for vulnerable code paths that often failed 
to materialize. In other words, definitively classifying and communicating risk 
was more complex in 2022, even for research teams whose bread and butter 
is vulnerability and exploit intelligence.Many organizations spent the first weeks (or 
months) of 2022 working their way down a 
lengthy list of Log4Shell remediations, taxing IT 
and security team resources that had already 
been depleted by shrinking budgets and 
pandemic exhaustion.Despite the vulnerabilitys undeniable impact, it turned out to be somewhat 
overrated as a universal attack vector; instead, application\-specific exploits 
had to be crafted for valuable target technologies, a number of which fell prey 
to Log4Shell exploitation in January 2022 and beyond. A months\-long tail of 
vendor impact assessments and downstream patches many of which required 
constant monitoring of advisories and community forums also compounded 
vulnerability management challenges for overburdened IT security teams.The security landscape in 2022 was not shaped by Log4Shell alone, of course, 
just as 2021s threat landscape featured dozens of widely exploited flaws and 
high\-profile attacks before December 9 rolled around. But the vulnerability that 
the U.S. Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) called endemic did set the stage 
for community\-wide vulnerability response in 2022 in several key ways.First, Log4Shell trauma put businesses in a heightened state of ready alert, 
driving stronger\-than\-usual reactions to subsequent vulnerabilities in popular 
libraries and frameworks. Neither Spring4Shell nor the not\-so\-aptly named 
Text4Shell merited its moniker, for instance. Moreover, the opportunity cost 
of an all\-consuming response to a vulnerability like Spring4Shell turned out to 
be high: Between March 25 and April 6, 2022, seven different vulnerabilities that 
eventually saw significant exploitation came to light, including three zero\-day 
flaws and a critical VMware attack chain that was exploited for full system 
takeover within 48 hours of disclosure. In hindsight, any number of these other 
flaws was arguably more urgent than Spring4Shell, but Log4Shell response6syndrome meant that organizations including security companies sunk 
resources disproportionately into vulnerabilities that looked similar to CVE\-2021\-
44228 on the surface, delaying or deprioritizing mitigations for other issues.Log4Shells dragging tail of downstream advisories also served to emphasize the 
importance of transparent, timely, standardized vulnerability disclosure practices 
in a healthy security ecosystem. There were plenty of software producers 
whose teams worked overtime to assess and communicate Log4Shell impact 
clearly in the days and weeks following the incident, but there were also plenty 
of cases where security teams were left wondering about uncommunicated 
risk. While there are a few technology vendors that embrace plain\-spoken 
frankness about vulnerabilities, the industry has plenty more ground to cover 
to ensure there are clear\-cut, openly accessible security advisories that include 
technical vulnerability details, attack scenarios, and timelines of exploitation. 
In a persistently elevated threat climate, with overt dependencies on common 
frameworks and shared components, transparency and useful intelligence 
sharing should be the ground floor, not the ceiling.Admittedly, doing all this well requires an abundance of security expertise. In 
an uneasy socioeconomic climate, concurrent crises are a stark reminder that 
markets depend on people to drive innovation and uphold critical infrastructure, 
as our strained healthcare systems have demonstrated so plainly these past 
few years. When droves of security practitioners are at risk of succumbing to 
burnout, we face an intersectional dilemma with broad business implications.In an industry captivated by the promises and 
potential of advanced technology, it can be 
easy to forget that the fundamental practice of 
security is not merely mechanical, but creative. 
It requires the ability to make connections,
to think ahead, and above all, to make 
informed decisions when risk is a value 
constantly in flux.As ever, this report strives to provide a framework for risk\-based decision 
making, backed by both original analysis from Rapid7 research teams and 
robust, well\-documented third\-party sources.72022 Exploited and 
Significant VulnerabilitiesRapid7 vulnerability researchers prioritize CVEs that are likely to impact many 
organizations, instead of those likely to affect only a few. We intentionally 
differentiate mass attacks from smaller\-scale or targeted exploitation; when 
a vulnerability is exploited by many attackers across many different industries 
and organizations, we deem that vulnerability a widespread threat. As a rule, 
organizations should expect to conduct incident response investigations that 
look for IOCs and post\-exploitation activity during widespread threat events 
in addition to activating emergency patching protocols.Vulnerabilities categorized as threats have been confirmed to be exploited in the 
wild by reputable sources (including Rapid7s own Labs and services teams), 
but in a more limited or targeted fashion than CVEs classified as widespread 
threats. Impending threats, on the other hand, have not yet seen exploitation 
by adversaries, but in our view are likely and valuable attack targets.What is a threat?A threat exists when there is an adversary with the intent, capability, and opportunity 
to act. When only two of these elements are present (e.g intent and opportunity), we 
call it an impending threat. When just one element is present (e.g an opportunity in 
the form of a vulnerability), it is a potential threat.8Impending Threat (10%)Threat (34%)Widespread Threat (56%)2022 Vulnerabilities by Threat StatusWidespread ThreatsOnce again, widespread threats comprised the majority of our 2022 vulnerability 
dataset (56%), down from 66% in 2021\. Common payloads dropped during mass 
exploitation included cryptocurrency miners, web shells, and a variety of botnet 
malware in addition to an ever more diverse set of ransomware payloads. At 
time of writing, all of the CVEs listed below except one (CVE\-2022\-33891\) were 
on the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agencys (CISA) Known 
Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list.Table 1: 2022 widely exploited vulnerabilitiesCVEThreat StatusTime to Known

executionInjection\* Exploitation in the wild privately reported to Rapid7For the most part, the first six weeks of 2022 were dominated by widespread 
exploitation of various business\-critical technologies vulnerable to Log4Shell. In 
particular, VMware vCenter and Horizon servers saw sustained mass attacks, 
prompting warnings from CISA and the UKs National Health Service (NHS) in 
addition to security company communications about observed exploitation. 
Rapid7 managed services teams observed exploitation across dozens of 
customers in January. Attackers also targeted Ubiquiti UniFi controllers and 
Zyxel devices, both of which offered initial access vectors.Unrelated to Log4Shell, CVE\-2021\-20038, a Rapid7\-discovered buffer overflow 
in SonicWall SMA 100 devices, began seeing rather clumsy exploitation 
attempts the last week of January 2022\. In defiance of barriers to scalable 
exploitation, CVE\-2021\-20038 made CISAs April 2022 list of Routinely Exploited 
Vulnerabilities, landing it squarely in widespread threat territory, unpredictable 
as that outcome may have been. In the last few weeks of 2022, Rapid7 was also11informed privately that at least one organization saw in\-the\-wild exploitation 
of CVE\-2021\-20038 as early as December 16, 2021, a mere nine days after 
SonicWall sent customers their disclosure and three\-plus weeks before 
Rapid7s research team published our own.Success, or lack thereof, of exploit attempts was a recurring topic of conversation 
throughout 2022\. Astute readers may have noticed that Spring4Shell (CVE\-
2022\-22965\) is conspicuously missing from our catalog of widespread 
threats, in spite of well\-documented mass exploitation attempts. While the 
occasional web shell did make it onto a host via Spring4Shell, its not clear that 
the vast majority of these exploit attempts were hitting vulnerable code paths. 
Similarly, the ironically named Text4Shell (CVE\-2022\-42889\) a remote code 
execution bug in Apache Commons Text that we refused on principle to include 
in our dataset at all saw a high volume of exploit attempts within a week of 
disclosure, but were still awaiting definitive confirmation that any vulnerable 
real\-world applications were actually affected.March, April, and May made for a blustery spring for security teams, with a 
widely exploited vulnerability appearing roughly once a week for the whole of 
the three\-month period, though notably, exploitation wasnt always immediate. 
Remote code execution bugs in Spring Cloud Gateway (CVE\-2022\-22947\) and 
Spring Cloud Function (CVE\-2022\-22963\) rounded out a bad March for Spring12products: CVE\-2022\-22947 was eventually incorporated into the cryptojacking 
Sysrv\-K botnet, per Microsoft. Matthew Remacle, a researcher at security 
firm GreyNoise Intelligence, privately shared data on several spikes of activity 
targeting Spring Cloud Function, with the highest payload count manifesting 
in Q2 2022; most of the payloads GreyNoise saw were indicative of low\-skilled 
attacks (i.e a heavy concentration of repurposed Nuclei templates).At the end of the first week of April, VMware published an advisory warning 
of serious remote code execution (CVE\-2022\-22954\) and privilege escalation 
(CVE\-2022\-22960\) flaws in their Workspace ONE Access solution. On May 18, 
CISA issued an alert about threat actor activity that had evidently started only 
two days out from the original advisory. The chain would turn out to be one of 
the most widely used attacks of 2022: to date, the vulnerabilities have been 
exploited to deploy ransomware, drop coin miners, install botnet malware, 
and more.May brought remote code execution vulnerabilities in F5 BIG\-IP (CVE\-2022\-
1\. and Zyxel firewalls (CVE\-2022\-30525\), both of which were exploited to 
drop cryptocurrency miners and web shells within a few days. Naturally, just 
before Memorial Day in the U.S the security research community discovered 
a novel malicious document file that had been used in the wild and was 
evading Windows Defender detection. The maldoc attack vector turned out 
to be a zero\-day flaw in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT). The 
community nicknamed the vulnerability Follina before Microsoft assigned 
CVE\-2022\-30190 several days later.Community interest in the Follina mystery may have contributed to the vulns 
weirdly enduring notoriety: Despite the fact that Follina is one of many malicious 
attachment\-type attacks used in the wild, ransomware actors seem to have 
picked it up, and security firm WatchGuard named it a top security incident in 
a mid\-year threat report. Rapid7s own threat intel detection engineering team 
also noted a steady stream of Follina detections in the weeks following the 
vulnerabilitys discovery, with one big caveat namely, that the overwhelming 
majority of detections were security personnel testing proofs of concept, or 
the occasional pen tester executing a social engineering operation.The Follina buzz hadnt yet faded when one of 2022s defining security incidents 
hit, looking to steal the mass exploitation crown from earlier VMware Workspace 
ONE Access and F5 BIG\-IP CVEs. On June 2, Australian technology company 
Atlassian published a security advisory for CVE\-2022\-26134, an actively exploited 
zero\-day remote code execution vulnerability in on\-premise instances of its 
hugely popular Confluence software. At the time of the advisorys publication, 
CVE\-2022\-26134 was unpatched; Atlassian released a fix on June 3, after13making the (correct) decision to release vulnerability information the day prior. 
The Confluence vulnerability offered a classic example of many attackers, 
many targets, as ransomware groups, cryptocurrency mining campaigns, and 
state\-sponsored threat actors leveraged CVE\-2022\-26134 for nefarious ends.Other 2022 widespread threats included CVE\-2022\-40684, a critical authentication 
bypass in widely deployed Fortinet firewalls and web proxies; CVE\-2022\-29499, 
a zero\-day vulnerability in Mitel MiVoice Connect appliances that provided an 
initial access vector for Lorenz ransomware; CVE\-2022\-26138, a hard\-coded 
password vulnerability in Atlassians Questions for Confluence application; 
yet another QNAP zero\-day flaw (CVE\-2022\-27593\) used in prolific DeadBolt 
ransomware attacks; and a mind\-boggling array of Zimbra Collaboration Suite 
vulnerabilities, including two zero\-days (CVE\-2022\-37042, CVE\-2022\-41352\) 
and an upstream bug in unRAR (CVE\-2022\-30333\) that were all used to deploy 
web shells in the wild.We Need to Talk About Exchange (Again)Well, here we are again. If anyone bet a pony on 2022 offering a reprieve from 
widely exploited vulnerabilities in on\-premises instances of Microsoft Exchange 
Server, they lost that bet definitively. At the end of September 2022, Vietnamese 
security firm GTSC published information and IOCs on what they claimed was 
a pair of unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities being used in 
attacks on their customers environments dating back to early August. Microsoft 
confirmed both zero\-day vulnerabilities later the same day and said they were 
aware of "limited, targeted attacks using the two vulnerabilities, which were 
assigned CVE\-2022\-41040 and CVE\-2022\-41082\.The vulns required authenticated network access for successful exploitation 
and appeared to be a variant of 2021s infamous ProxyShell attack chain (CVE\-
2021\-34523, CVE\-2021\-34473, CVE\-2021\-31207\), though notably, ProxyShell 
didnt require authentication. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont christened 
the new zero\-day chain ProxyNotShell, as security teams waited hopefully 
for a quick fix.It didnt come. October 2022s Patch Tuesday came and went without a patch 
for the ProxyNotShell vulns, and systems administrators had to make do with 
a temporary mitigationmore specifically, a regular expression\-based block 
rule that attackers quickly bypassed. Microsoft updated the rule, attackers 
bypassed it again, and on and on the cycle went, leaving security teams 
confused and frustrated.14A true fix arrived on November 8, 2022, but historically, Exchange patch 
uptake has been much slower than the pace of attacks. Six weeks after the 
patch was released, mere days before Christmas, security firm CrowdStrike 
published a blog disclosing a fresh exploit technique that bypassed Microsofts 
suggested mitigation technique by using the Outlook Web Application (OWA) 
endpoint as the initial attack vector rather than the Autodiscover endpoint 
Microsofts block rule had considered. CrowdStrike had discovered the 
new exploit while investigating several Play ransomware incidents. Rapid7 
managed services teams similarly saw an uptick in incidents stemming 
from exploitation of unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server installations, 
including to deploy ransomware.The spruced\-up attack chain was nicknamed OWASSRF. But only servers 
that hadnt applied the November 8 patch were vulnerable to the new 
technique; CrowdStrike assessed that the OWA vector probably mapped 
to CVE\-2022\-41080, which was fixed at the same time as CVE\-2022\-41040 
(whose exploitation was the first step in the original ProxyNotShell attack 
chain) and CVE\-2022\-41082 (the secondary remote code execution step).Even with a fresh barrage of attacks aimed at Exchange servers, tens of 
thousands of vulnerable systems persist on the open internet. We hear 2023 
might finally be the year of the Linux desktop maybe itll also be a year 
without fresh 0day in on\-prem Exchange.15Other Known Exploited 
VulnerabilitiesRapid7 teams tracked a number of known\-exploited vulnerabilities in 2022 
that were not categorized as widespread threats, 17 of which we deemed 
interesting or notable. This category usually carries a little bit of intrigue, as 
known\-exploited flaws with no evidence of widespread exploitation are, in our 
experience, likelier to have arisen from zero\-day exploits (mystery!), and also 
likelier to lack in\-depth details (rude!). At time of writing, two of the vulnerabilities 
listed below (CVE\-2022\-31199, CVE\-2022\-28810\) were not on CISAs KEV list.Table 2: 2022 exploited in the wild CVEsCVEThreat StatusTime to Known

ControlOf particular note are five different zero\-day vulnerabilities in security gateway 
and firewall products, all of which seem to have been exploited before disclosure, 
in addition to a mysterious vuln in WatchGuard Firebox (CVE\-2022\-26318\) that 
we couldnt confirm was exploited as a zero\-day, and that may be linked to 
Cyclops Blink threat activity detailed in a February 2022 CISA alert. Theres also 
little detail on exploits or threat actors targeting Fortinet (CVE\-2022\-42475\) 
and Trend Micro Apex One (CVE\-2022\-40139\), though this was one of at least 
two Apex One zero\-day vulnerabilities that debuted in 2022\.More is known about CVE\-2022\-27518 thanks to a December 2022 U.S. National 
Security Agency (NSA) bulletin on APT5 activity targeting Citrix ADC installations. 
CVE\-2022\-27518 isnt mentioned explicitly, but the document contains a link 
to Citrixs advisory, which was published the same day as the NSA warning. 
Rapid7 has also kept an eye on Citrix ADC as a perennially popular target for 
both skilled and commodity attackers.17Rounding out the security gateway entries are CVE\-2022\-3236 and CVE\-2022\-
1040, two remote code execution vulnerabilities in Sophos Firewalls that were 
exploited in targeted attacks against South Asian customers, as indicated in 
disclosures released six months apart. Initially we didnt pay much attention to 
these, as Sophos Firewalls auto\-update by default (yay!), which should mean 
less opportunity for many attackers to exploit the vulns. But the number of 
advanced threat actors using CVE\-2022\-1040 is, frankly, compelling: The flaw 
has been linked to APT operations targeting Ukraine, Tibetans, and South 
Asian victims in Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. 
CVE\-2022\-3236 doesnt yet have a similarly long list of exploit targets, but its 
not a stretch to imagine it was (or will be) used in similar operations as long 
as theres unpatched attack surface area.Microsoft Active Directory attack techniques had a big(ger) year in 2021 
following a SpecterOps presentation at Black Hat USA outlining a dozen\-plus 
new techniques for abusing Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS). In May 
2022, researcher Oliver Lyak at the Danish Institute for Cyber Risk (IFCR) detailed 
a new technique that leveraged a weakness in AD CS certificate templates to 
escalate privileges. Nicknamed Certifried, the issue was tracked as CVE\-2022\-
26923 and patched in Microsofts May 2022 Patch Tuesday release; however, 
as several sources pointed out, AD administrators needed to take additional 
action post\-patch since not all attack avenues were fully remediated. CISA 
added CVE\-2022\-26923 to their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list on 
August 18, 2022 without additional context.The first mention of CVE\-2022\-31199, a code execution bug in Netwrix Auditor 
IT software that was disclosed in July 2022, was a December 2022 threat brief 
describing a spike in TrueBot malware infections that went back to August 
1\. The software in question wasnt found to have a large internet\-facing 
footprint, but the original Bishop Fox advisory describing the flaw emphasizes 
that the vulnerable service is frequently executed with high privileges in an 
Active Directory environment, opening an avenue for AD compromise.Veeam CVE\-2022\-26501 (along with CVE\-2022\-26500\) was cited in a December 
2022 analysis from Kroll on novel tactics observed in AvosLocker ransomware 
incidents. Veeams backup solution was abused to exfiltrate data before the 
threat actor deleted backups; earlier in the year, Veeam was also abused for 
credential stealing in connection with various ransomware crews, though 
specific CVEs werent mentioned.Apache APISIX CVE\-2022\-24112, a remote code execution vulnerability 
disclosed in February 2022, appeared on CISAs list of CVEs routinely exploited 
by Chinese state\-sponsored actors, alongside previously mentioned vulns in 
F5 (CVE\-2022\-1388\) and Atlassian (CVE\-2022\-26134\) software.18Spotlight: ManageEngine Zero\-Day Detected in the 
Wild (CVE\-2022\-28810\)In April 2022, Rapid7 managed services teams detected unusual activity across 
multiple customer environments. The activity turned out to be a financially 
motivated campaign conducted by a skilled threat actor. In almost all cases, 
the adversary used default administrative credentials to gain access to publicly 
facing instances of Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus and Desktop Central 
before abusing the custom scripts feature in ADSelfService Plus.The Rapid7 vulnerability research team developed an exploit that replicated 
the attacker behavior and determined that there was a zero\-day vulnerability 
in ADSelfService Plus. The vulnerability arose from a feature that allowed 
the admin user to execute arbitrary operating system commands after a 
password reset or account lockout status update; it was trivial for a threat 
actor with stolen or default admin credentials to execute operating system (OS) 
commands remotely on the target system to achieve persistence and pivot 
further into the environment. Moreover, because the %password% variable 
in scripts wasnt sanitized or obfuscated, the admin user could observe all 
password changes, potentially allowing them to recover valid credentials for 
Active Directory accounts.Rapid7 reported the security issues to Zoho, who fixed the security issues by 
making several changes, including no longer accepting scripts through the web 
interface and requiring post action scripts to be placed on disk by a user with 
access to the underlying operating system. CVE\-2022\-28810 was assigned as 
an umbrella for the various issues reported and fixed. In November 2022, an 
ESET research report detailing advanced persistent threat (APT) activity noted 
that CVE\-2022\-28810 was the suspected culprit in the compromise of a U.S. 
defense contractors ADSelfService Plus instance.The full vulnerability disclosure for CVE\-2022\-28810 is here.19Impending ThreatsOnce again this year, our impending threats list has dwindled in order to make 
room for the many vulnerabilities that have seen active or mass exploitation. 
While we could easily leave impending threats out of our vulnerability dataset 
entirely, we believe this is an important category, particularly when it highlights 
products or flaws that are more likely to escape scrutiny or exploit detection.Table 3: 2022 impending threat CVEsCVEThreat StatusDisclosure

small part because of their large deployment footprints. We havent been able to 
definitively confirm exploitation of Zimbra Collaboration Suite CVE\-2022\-37393, 
which went unpatched for nearly a year, but with widespread exploitation of 
many other Zimbra flaws, its hardly a stretch to assume attackers would be 
tempted to leverage a privilege escalation that delivered root privileges. Likewise, 
a variety of Zoho ManageEngine software has been broadly exploited the past 
few years, and while ADAuditPlus seems to have a small internet\-facing target 
population, multiple public exploits are available for CVE\-2022\-28219\.20In August 2022, at Black Hat USA and DEF CON 30, Rapid7 disclosed 10 
different security issues affecting Cisco Adaptive Security Software (ASA), 
Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), and FirePOWER Services Software 
for ASA. Among these issues was CVE\-2022\-20829, which highlighted a lack 
of any type of cryptographic signature to verify the Cisco ASDM packages 
authenticity. Researcher Jake Baines discovered that it was possible to modify 
the contents of an ASDM package, update a hash in the packages header, and 
successfully install the package on a Cisco ASA meaning an attacker could 
craft an ASDM package that contains malicious installers, malicious web 
pages, andor malicious Java. An administrator using the ASDM client could 
then connect to the ASA and download or execute attacker\-provided Java, 
giving the attacker access to the administrators system.This isnt an attack thats likely to propagate among low\-skilled adversaries, but 
its exactly the type of attack that sophisticated threat actors would use and 
have used in the past. A malicious ASDM package could be installed in a supply 
chain attack, leveraged by an insider threat, installed by a third\-party vendor
administrator, or made available for free on the internet for administrators to 
discover themselves (as those without valid Cisco contracts might be tempted 
to do). As part of the vulnerability disclosure, Rapid7 published a tool that 
demonstrates extracting and rebuilding valid ASDM packages. It can also 
generate ASDM packages with an embedded reverse shell.Rounding out our impending threats category this year are CVE\-2022\-2992, an 
authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in GitLab software, and CVE\-
2021\-39144, an unauthenticated remote code execution vuln in VMware Cloud 
Foundations implementation of XStream, an open\-source XML serialization 
library. Successful exploitation of CVE\-2021\-39144 offers malicious actors 
code execution as root on NSX\-V appliances thanks to an unauthenticated 
endpoint that leverages XStream for input serialization. Public exploits are 
available for both vulnerabilities.2020 and 2021 Impending Threats:
Where Are They Now?While this report focuses on vulnerabilities that were exploited or otherwise 
significant in 2022, its essential to note that older vulnerabilities continue to 
be exploited widely and should also be prioritized for remediation. In CISAs 
list of routinely exploited vulnerabilities from 2021, more than a quarter of the 
highlighted CVEs were from 2020 or earlier meaning there were enough of 
those unpatched systems that exploiting vulnerabilities a year old (or two, or 
three, or four years old) was still a reliable option for attackers.In that same vein, weve watched impending threats from our 2020 and 2021 
Vulnerability Intelligence reports slowly make their way into threat intelligence 
briefs and news articles, even multiple years later. 44% of the CVEs Rapid7 
classified as impending threats in previous intelligence reports have been21exploited in the wild as of December 2022, up from 25% at the end of 2021\. 
At least five impending threats from past years have been exploited at scale 
by ransomware groups, cryptocurrency mining operations, or botnet malware:CVE\-2020\-0609: Windows Remote Desktop Gateway Remote
Code Execution "BlueGate"CVE\-2020\-5135: SonicWall SonicOS Portal Buffer OverflowCVE\-2020\-2021: Palo Alto Networks PAN\-OS SAML Authentication Bypass 
and Remote Code ExecutionCVE\-2020\-16846: SaltStack Salt Command InjectionCVE\-2021\-34481: Microsoft Windows Print Spooler Remote
Code ExecutionRapid7s 2021 Vulnerability Intelligence Report also emphasized the risk of 
Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks, where an adversary 
with administrative privileges installs a legitimately signed driver with known 
vulnerabilities on the victim system. BYOVD attacks have been commonly used 
in the wild, as Rapid7 researchers detailed in depth in December 2021\. But 
even though this style of attack has demonstrable uptake among adversaries, 
weve also seen that product security incident response teams (PSIRTs) tend 
to lose interest when evaluating BYOVD vulnerability disclosures, because 
administrator\-level privileges are required from the start.As it happens, BYOVD attacks surged in 2022: Multiple security firms reported 
in\-the\-wild exploitation of vulnerable drivers, threat reports were dedicated 
to analyzing driver\-based attacks, and media coverage underscored BYOVD 
adoption by ransomware groups. As we noted in the list above, CVE\-2021\-
34481, which allows non\-administrative users to add arbitrary signed drivers to 
the Windows Driver Store, has also been linked to ransomware usage, though 
sources seem to incorrectly categorize it as a PrintNightmare variant rather 
than consider it a driver\-based vector.Organizations looking to protect themselves from some driver\-based attacks 
can employ Microsofts driver block rules, which should in theory prevent 
known\-bad drivers from being loaded if Redmond actually fixed the update 
mechanism that puts those rules into action following community feedback 
that bad drivers werent being blocked as advertised.22Notable Attack TrendsTime to Known ExploitationAs a key metric, Rapid7 researchers track the time between when vulnerabilities 
become known to the public and when they are reported as exploited in the 
wild. This window, which we call Time to Known Exploitation (TTKE), gives 
organizations a sense of how quickly significant vulnerabilities are incorporated 
into attacker arsenals after theyre released in advisories or threat briefs 
(or on social media). As usual, were not trying to capture the full volume of 
zero\-day exploitation in the wild, a not\-insignificant amount of which spans 
browser\- and host\-based vulnerabilities, which we traditionally exclude except 
for extraordinary cases.We take a generally conservative approach to defining TTKE. In most cases, the 
values for time to known exploitation mean that at most, each vulnerability was 
exploited within the number of days specified. If we take CVE\-2021\-4034, for 
instance, the 153 is based on the date the vulnerability was added to CISAs 
Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list, which almost certainly was not the 
first time it was exploited in the wild.23Weve also estimated TTKE in a few cases for example, when a third\-party 
incident response report specifies that a CVE was exploited during a particular 
month but doesnt specify the day exploitation was first detected (e.g in early 
August), we take a conservative approach and use the middle or later part of 
that timeline as our TTKE value. For the most part, a margin of error of a few 
weeks is acceptable. If the margin of error could reasonably be months (e.g 
CVE\-2022\-26352\), we list TTKE as Unknown.First, the good news: Average time to known exploitation for our 2022 
vulnerabilities was 24\.5 days more than twice as long as 2021s meager 
average TTKE of 12 days.Now, the bad news: Averages are fickle creatures, and higher TTKE values for 
certain 2022 vulnerabilities obscures the litany of zeroes attached to a big 
swath of others. 56% of the vulnerabilities in this report were exploited within 
seven days of public disclosurea 12% rise over 2021 and an 87% rise over 
1\. If we look at the median value instead of taking the average, median time 
to exploitation in 2022 was one day across the vulnerabilities weve included 
in this report. (To be fair, the median time to exploitation in 2021 was zero, so 
we can hold on to a single\-day improvement as a faint silver lining.)010203040506044%56%exploited vulnerabilities

the new normal. 44% of known exploited vulnerabilities in this report arose 
from a zero\-day exploit, though the occasional data validation challenge could 
reasonably skew that by a few percentage points. Some of the challenge in 
determining TTKE hangs on the definition of public or disclosed for example, 
the change that remediated CVE\-2022\-22963 in Spring Cloud Function was 
committed in a public GitHub repository on March 24, 2022, without any mention 
of a CVE or a security issue. Akamai began observing exploitation in the wild 
on March 27, two days before the fixed version of Spring Cloud Function was 
officially released with a CVE on March 29\. We chose to use 0 as our TTKE 
value for CVE\-2022\-22963, since its unreasonable to expect the general public 
(including Spring Cloud customers) to examine individual GitHub commits for 
potential security implications.CVE\-2022\-42475, a heap\-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Fortinets 
FortiOS, makes for a similar edge case and heres where the coordinated 
part of coordinated vulnerability disclosure is important. On December 9, 
2022, a French security company published a bulletin on a critical, non\-public 
vulnerability in Fortinet SSL VPNs. As it turned out, Fortinet had privately given 
customers early warning about the vulnerability the week of December 7, but 
didnt release a public advisory until December 12\. When the advisory was 
published, it included a note that Fortinet was aware of an instance where 
this vulnerability was exploited in the wild, but failed to specify whether the 
flaw had been exploited by threat actors before they released a fixed version 
 which they evidently did silently on November 28, 2022, potentially giving 
adversaries time to reverse engineer the patch and develop exploits before 
customers knew there was even a remediation to implement.Was CVE\-2022\-42475 true zero\-day exploitation? Probably, given the vulnerability's 
root cause and the circumstances. Timelines are tricky, as anyone whos had 
to compile a good one knows. But the true harm of silent patches isnt our 
inability to definitively express a TTKE value; its that they ensure only skilled 
adversaries get a head start and they dont need it.Any way you skin it, attackers are fast, and general consensus is that theyve 
grown increasingly efficient at targeting vulnerabilities both new and known 
in the wild. In order to develop policies and practices that mitigate the risk 
of faster time to exploitation, security practitioners need not only detailed 
guidance, but also the why behind it and that means vulnerability details, 
delivered transparently, in ways accessible to security teams and researchers. 
To intentionally obfuscate these details from customers, security solution 
vendors, and academics only cedes the initiative to the attackers who already 
are demonstrably skilled at reversing under\-documented patches.25RansomwareBy all accounts, the ransomware ecosystem continued to mature and expand 
in 2022, as multiple newcomers established operations and news broke of 
high\-profile attacks on world governments, intelligence agencies, municipal 
systems, school districts, critical infrastructure, and of course private 
businesses spanning every possible vertical.The island nation of Vanuatu was knocked completely offline for more than a 
month after a ransomware attack felled its IT systems in November 2022, causing 
the Australian government to step in to assist. Costa Rica declared a state of 
emergency in April 2022 after being subjected to weeks of ongoing attacks. In 
May, the U.S. State Department called Conti ransomware the costliest strain 
of ransomware ever documented and offered millions of dollars in rewards 
for information that would help bring Conti ransomware threat actors to justice 
(which may or may not have succeeded).Table 4: 2022 ransomware CVEsCVEThreat StatusTTKE

Access ControlIt seems like a foregone conclusion that there should be clear\-cut statistics 
proving there were more ransomware incidents and related artifacts, including 
associated CVEs, in 2022 than in previous years but strangely, thats not
the case.Only 14 of the CVEs in our 2022 vulnerability dataset could be definitively confirmed 
as having been used in ransomware attacks. Ransomware\-mapped vulnerabilities 
decreased 33% year over year in 2022, in spite of the demonstrably flourishing 
ransomware ecosystem. Thats unsettling, even if it sounds like good news.We arent alone in seeing ransomware\-related numbers that were lower than 
expected. Digital Shadows noted a decline in ransomware victims in Q3 2022, 
cyber insurance company Coalition said ransomware claims from policyholders 
declined in the first half of 2022, and an annual review released by Ciscos 
Talos team in December 2022 shows that ransomware comprised 21% of the 
companys incident response (IR) engagements in 2022, compared with 38% 
of all IRs in 2021\.27Security firm Emsisoft published a blog in January 2023 indicating that the 
number of ransomware incidents they saw in 2022 were very similar to 
previous years, acknowledging the difficulty of getting accurate statistical data 
on cybersecurity incidents. Rapid7s own managed services teams also observed 
ransomware incident response numbers that didnt quite meet expectations: 
While there were more ransomware\-related incident responses overall in 2022 
than in 2021, the number of ransomware incidents was lower than expected 
when accounting for customer growth and expected threat volume.What could explain why ransomware numbers imperfect and fractured 
though they may be were lower than predicted in 2022? For one thing, we 
cant discount the possibility that some ransomware victims simply arent 
reporting incidents. Like any ecosystem, however, the ransomware market is 
complex and interconnected, and its likely that several factors come into play.One potential factor that the NSA believes is influencing ransomware numbers 
is the sanctions stemming from the war in Ukraine, as NSA cybersecurity 
director Rob Joyce remarked at a UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) 
event in May 2022:One interesting trend we see is in the last 
month or two ransomware is actually down. 
There's probably a lot of different reasons why 
that is but I think one impact is the fallout of 
Russia\-Ukraine.As we do sanctions and it's harder to move 
money and it's harder to buy infrastructure in 
the West, we're seeing them be less effective. 
That is one of the knock\-on effects.28Its also possible, as a Ukrainian security firm told The Economist in November 
2022, that some ransomware threat actors were pulled into the conflict, shifting 
the focus of their cybercrime operations away from the mass market. Even 
early on in the conflict there were signs of infighting among ransomware 
threat actors, with Lockbit going so far as to explicitly declare its neutrality. 
As a Reuters analysis pointed out, this move was practical, since declaring a 
political affiliation could undermine ransomware groups ability to get paid 
for instance, because of cyber\-insurance provider loopholes that could exempt 
insurance payouts in cases of war.Some responsibility for lower ransomware figures almost certainly lies with 
the sheer number of ransomware groups and strains that have appeared in 
the market, as diversification inevitably leads to changes in operations. A 
Q1 2022 Cisco Talos report observed that No one ransomware family was 
observed twice in incidents that closed out this quarter. Rapid7 IR consultants 
likewise observed a vast array of ransomware families in 2022 incidents, and 
while global security firms tend to stay closely on top of evolving ransomware 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), ransomware diversification also 
means more indicators and techniques to document and attribute, which takes 
time and expertise.One particular trend thats picked up steam in 2022 is the buying and selling 
of initial access on dark web marketplaces by initial access brokers (IABs).29Initial access brokers aim to do only one thing: gain initial access. Once that 
access is established either through exploitation or through means like 
phishing, credential stuffing, or brute force attacks access brokers will list 
their targets on the dark web to sell these footholds to other cybercriminals. 
In essence, this decouples the attack chain and builds in latency between 
the initial exploitation of a vulnerable service and the follow\-on actions threat 
analysts typically look for.Initial access brokers provide a valuable
service to cybercriminals like ransomware 
actors, since oftentimes, these cybercriminals 
are opportunistic about their targets.For defenders, this adds complexity to investigating an incident, as the chain of 
actions one would normally look for is often going to start after initial access 
has been established. This increases the uncertainty about when, where, and 
how access was gained.In some cases, like CVE\-2022\-26134, the sale is a target list. In most cases, 
however, the sale is access to a particular organization. The Rapid7 IntSights 
team has observed dark web activity where exploits were bought and sold 
for a number of the widely exploited vulnerabilities in this report; participants 
on the relevant threads are known access brokers. Even when a specific CVE 
isnt mentioned, we can occasionally make conjectures about the exploit. 
For example, when our threat intelligence team saw an access broker post 
access is via Citrix on December 9, 2022, its a reasonable guess that the 
broker leveraged either CVE\-2022\-27518 or CVE\-2022\-27510\.Attacker Utilities and Vulnerability 
ClassesWhen getting to know a new vulnerability, the first thing our research teams look for 
is an understanding of the root cause and what an attacker might use that bug to 
achieve. Vulnerabilities arise from hundreds of conditions spanning all layers of the 
stack from application programming errors to cryptographic implementations 
to hardware bugs. Likewise, the potential impact of any given vulnerability can 
vary widely based on implementation, security controls, and the sensitivity of
the data or permissions an attacker can obtain as a result of exploitation.30We include two additional types of metadata in our vulnerability dataset in addition 
to threat status and time to known exploitation. The first piece of metadata 
our researchers define when analyzing emergent threats is vulnerability class, 
which is useful for making initial assessments about relative exploitability and 
available tooling. Deserialization flaws, for instance, come with a reputation for 
high exploitability and have readily available public tooling. Memory corruption 
vulns make frequent appearances in attacks by state\-sponsored threat actors, 
as they often require high skill on part of exploit developers, and are less likely 
to be automated than something like a simple command injection exploit.InjectionImproper Access ControlDeserializationUnknownMemory Corruption2022 saw a slight decline in improper access control vulnerabilities (e.g 
authentication bypasses) and deserialization flaws, including those exploited en 
masse. While memory corruptions (e.g heap\- or stack\-based buffer overflows, 
use\-after\-frees) are still less represented than other categories, the number 
of widespread threats arising from a memory corruption flaw doubled over 
1\. Finally, the injection star continued to rise: Injection attacks use specially 
crafted input and techniques (e.g command injection, OGNL injection, server\-
side request forgery) to compromise data integrity or run arbitrary code as a 
high\-privileged user. These attacks tend to be stable and reliable, which can 
make them less likely to knock over systems than some other types of exploits.312022 Vulnerabilities by Class and Threat StatusWidespread ThreatUnknownDeserializationMemory CorruptionImproper Access ControlInjectionThreatDeserializationUnknownMemory CorruptionInjectionImproper Access ControlImpending ThreatThe second type of metadata we consider is attacker utility, which describes 
what an attacker can hope to gain as a result of successful exploitation this 
sometimes maps to part of an exploit chain. A network pivot, for example, is 
an attack that gives an external adversary internal network access, while more 
generalized remote code execution allows an attacker to execute a payload 
remotely on a target.Remote Code ExecutionNetwork PivotLocal Code ExecutionNetwork Infrastructure CompromiseSocial EngineeringIT Security CompromiseIT Security Mgmt CompromiseNetwork PivotRemote Code ExecutionLocal Code ExecutionCloud Infrastructure CompromiseSocial EngineeringIT Security Mgmt CompromiseRemote Code ExecutionLocal Code ExecutionCloud Infrastructure CompromiseSocial EngineeringNetwork PivotIn previous years, we used the term network infrastructure compromise as an 
umbrella term for vulnerabilities that led to remote code execution or takeover 
of things like network management, virtualization, or backup systems, which 
when compromised could give an attacker access to everything managed by 
that software or device. Our 2022 data, however, spanned so many different 
vulnerabilities in IT and security management solutions (e.g access and identity 
management, Active Directory management) that we broke them out into a 
separate category. The other newcomer is cloud infrastructure compromise, 
which encompasses cloud gateway, API management, or other devops\-related 
technology. We expect this category to continue to grow in threat prevalence 
as cloud adoption increases.322022 Vulnerabilities by Attacker Utility and Threat StatusWidespread ThreatThreatImpending ThreatWidespread exploitation of remote code execution vulnerabilities has remained 
relatively consistent across our dataset year over year, as expected given this 
reports focus on widespread exploitation of server\-side targets. Similarly, its 
a no\-brainer that network pivots (e.g Fortinet CVE\-2022\-40684, SonicWall 
CVE\-2021\-20038\) will continue to be high\-value targets for both advanced and 
commodity attackers. Follina CVE\-2022\-30190 is the sole entry in the social 
engineering category, which we dont anticipate being a regular participant in 
these attacker utility round\-ups (again, given this reports slant toward server\-
side bugs).In a bit of a departure from previous years, 2022 featured four local privilege 
escalations that were widely exploited across VMware (CVE\-2022\-22960\), 
Linux (CVE\-2021\-4034, aka Pwnkit), and Windows (CVE\-2022\-21882, CVE\-
2022\-41073\) environments. Privilege escalation is an indispensable part of 
most attack chains, but LPE tends to be underrepresented in these types of 
charts, particularly among widespread threats.Spotlight: Privilege Escalation from 
the PerimeterMany of the CVEs treated individually in this report can be (and have been) 
used in concert with one or more additional vulnerabilities to achieve something 
beyond the scope of a single CVEs impact. After gaining access with a remote 
exploit, attackers frequently need to escalate their privileges in order to achieve 
their objectives. They use local privilege escalation vulnerabilities to do this, yet 
many LPEs miss out on the spotlight (not to mention patching and detection 
prioritization) compared to their flashier counterparts.Rapid7 researchers disclosed a number of local privilege escalation vulnerabilities 
in 2022 that exemplify this use case. CVE\-2022\-30526, for instance, allows a 
low\-privileged user (e.g nobody) to escalate to root on affected Zyxel firewalls. 
The vulnerability requires existing shell access to the firewalla conundrum, 
until a bug like CVE\-2022\-30525 comes along to offer arbitrary code execution. 
In this particular case, not only does the vulnerable system sit on the network 
perimeter, the LPE was patched more than two months after the unauthenticated 
remote command injection vulnerability, giving savvy attackers an opportunity 
to find the LPE avenue on devices that had been compromised or were left 
unpatched after CVE\-2022\-30525 was disclosed.In August of 2022, Rapid7 disclosed two local privilege escalation vulnerabilities 
in VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager, and vRealize Automation 
software. CVE\-2022\-31660 and CVE\-2022\-31661 allow an under\-privileged 
horizon user to escalate permissions to root. Since the horizon user runs 
the externally accessible web application remote code execution within that 
component could be chained with either privilege escalation to execute code as 
the root user. CVE\-2022\-22954, the critical remote code execution vulnerability33disclosed in April 2022 and widely exploited within days, provided the requisite 
remote access on vulnerable VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity 
Manager instances.In November 2022, Rapid7 disclosed a number of security issues in F5 BIG\-IP 
and BIG\-IQ, only two of which were assigned CVEs. One of the CVE\-less issues 
was a local privilege escalation via bad UNIX socket permissions: F5 uses 
a proprietary database called mcp, which is used for persistent storage on 
Big\-IP and related devices. The database is owned by root and accessed via 
a UNIX domain socket with 0777 permissions (accessible by all local users) 
and no authentication. Using that socket, any user on the host can add a new 
administrative user, granting themselves root access.F5 declined to categorize this issue as a vulnerability, because by design, all 
users that log in are already root (and it's true that the overwhelming amount 
of Big\-IP's attack surface runs as root already). However, several network 
services including Apache Tomcat and Bind listen on network ports and 
link to custom modules written in CC\+\+. If a vulnerability is discovered in any 
of those non\-root services, a privilege escalation exploit path directly to root 
removes the small amount of privilege separation that exists.Network edge and access control systems arent the only example of this trend. 
In October of 2021, independent researcher Darren Martyn published an exploit 
for a zero\-day root privilege escalation vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration 
Suite. When successfully exploited, the vulnerability allowed a user with a shell 
account as the zimbra user to escalate to root. While this issue requires a 
local account on the Zimbra host, a slew of actively exploited vulnerabilities 
provide plenty of opportunity to obtain it, as we saw throughout 2022\.Defenders can get ahead of future attacks by taking care not to treat individual 
vulnerabilities as if they existed in a vacuum, but instead choosing to implement 
controls and detection mechanisms across the whole of their environment.34CONCLUSIONAt Rapid7, we believe that research\-driven context on vulnerabilities and emergent 
threats is critical to building forward\-looking security programs and advancing 
community knowledge. Security and IT teams face mounting challenges in 
a heightened threat climate, and we are committed to partnering with those 
teams to foster better understanding of defense\-in\-depth strategies that will 
strengthen organizations security posture, both now and in the future.Basicvulnerabilitymanagementiscriticaltoyoursecurityprogram.
The window for effective patching has decreased over the past three years. 
It is essential that organizations have emergency patching procedures and 
incident response playbooks in place in addition to a clearly defined, regular 
patch cycle that prioritizes actively and widely exploited CVEs. Without an 
understood, standardized mechanism for driving aligned emergency action, 
youre at higher risk from these increasingly frequent events.In addition to regular and emergency patching procedures, organizations 
should ensure they keep current with operating system\-level updates, such as 
Microsofts Cumulative Updates for Windows systems. Failing to ensure timely 
installation of Cumulative Updates may mean that you are unable to quickly 
install out\-of\-band security patches when sudden attacks occur.The same principle applies to all operating system\-level patches, no matter 
the platform; OS\-level vulnerabilities are a boon to attackers, even if they are 
not exposed to the internet.Network edge devices (network pivots) continue to be popular and frequently 
exposed attack surface area. The same goes for IT or security management 
solutions that run with elevated privileges, as well as email servers like Microsoft 
Exchange. These categories of software and firmware should adhere to a zero\-
day patch cycle wherever possible, meaning that updates andor downtime 
should be scheduled as soon as new critical advisories are released.35Limit and monitor your internet\-facing attack surface area. 
Understanding attack surface area and critical network entry points saves time 
when severe vulnerabilities surface in internet\-facing technologies. Exploitation 
of many of the CVEs in this report including some of those exploited in zero\-
day attacks can be slowed down by limiting internet exposure of critical 
applications and management interfaces. Pay particular attention to security 
gateway products such as VPNs and firewalls, as well as anything else thats 
exposed by common practice or necessity.Management and administrative interfaces should never be exposed to the 
public internet. The same goes for domain controllers and any other assets that 
organizations would not want an external attacker to be able to probe, such as 
IoT devices unwittingly exposed online. Audit internet\-exposed attack surface 
area regularly, including via external penetration tests, if possible.Ensuring that (preferably aggregated) logging is set up across networks 
and hosts will save some time during active threat events. There are several 
community\-driven signature repositories and low\-cost rulesets that can give 
defenders at least basic visibility into potential intrusions in their environments, 
along with a plethora of commercial solutions. Knowing ahead of time what 
kind of visibility you have into suspicious events will drive faster and more 
effective responses during critical situations.Future Rapid7 ResearchRapid7 researchers and community members publish analysis of high\-priority

in 2022, but it does represent a diverse sample of attacker use cases and 
exploitation case studies, with heavy emphasis on widespread attacks. Our 
intent is not to imply that any one CVE or vulnerability group is less important 
than others. Security teams, network administrators, and defenders at large 
have in\-depth understanding of which assets are critical in their environments 
and how action taken may affect their business priorities. What we offer is an 
attacker\-centric view of the vulnerability landscape that Rapid7 customers and 
the security community can use to inform the policies and practices that they 
employ as part of a larger defense\-in\-depth strategy.Full 2022 DatasetCVEThreat StatusCVE\-2022\-40684Fortinet FortiOS Authentication BypassThreat \- widespread

exploited in the wild in 2022\. The CVEs we have categorized as exploited in the 
wild in this report are not the only vulnerabilities actively exploited during the 
2022 calendar year. For example, we have excluded many browser, mobile, and 
host\-based vulnerabilities known to be exploited in the wild (e.g bugs in Internet 
Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox, or bugs in iOS and macOS). Google Project Zero 
has a spreadsheet of some other zero\-days exploited in the wild in 2022 here, 
with more of a focus on browser\- and host\-based bugs.CVSS scores have been removed from our dataset as of 2021\. CVSS score can 
be a useful metric, but we believe other forms of metadata, such as threat status 
and attacker utility, are more important for risk assessment and prioritization 
than CVSS alone.Since the trustworthiness of our data is important, we cite primary sources 
wherever possible for vulnerabilities weve listed as exploited in the wildthat 
is, we reference firsthand accounts of exploitation from the organizations or 
individuals who detected, verified, and reported them. Examples of primary 
sources referenced throughout this paper include U.S. cybersecurity and 
intelligence agency alerts on known exploitation; security firm analyses of threats 
and IOCs theyve tracked during incident response or other investigations; and 
vendor advisories that specify exploitation in the wild (this includes CVEs that 
are disclosed as zero\-days).In the interest of readability, in some cases we also cite articles in security news 
publications that aggregate disparate reports of exploitation. This is especially 
useful when certain vulnerabilities, like Atlassian Confluence CVE\-2022\-26134 
or Log4Shell CVE\-2021\-44228, are so widely exploited that it is helpful to see 
them contextualized in a single article. Our goal in citing news sources is to 
allow readers to understand the volume and impact of exploitation as quickly 
as possible.Threat CategorizationWidespread threats are vulnerabilities under attack by many bad actors. Previously, 
we categorized any CVE that was leveraged by ransomware operators as a 
widespread threat, since ransomware is by nature an at\-scale operation and 
relies on volume to succeed. However, we have changed this policy in 2022 to 
accommodate evolving statistics on targeted ransomware.Threats categorized as exploited in the wild are, quite simply, not known to 
be broadly exploited at time of writing. It is possible that evidence of broader 
exploitation exists but has not been shared publicly.41Likewise, while we do not have evidence at time of writing that CVEs in our 
impending threat category are exploited in the wild, lack of evidence does not 
mean absence of exploitation (e.g CVE\-2022\-20829, CVE\-2022\-28219\).Ransomware CitationsWe use security news articles frequently to document ransomware operators use 
of specific CVEs. Ransomware citations in this report are a binary either there 
is credible technical evidence of ransomware groups usage of a vulnerability 
or there is not. Lack of confirmation does not mean a CVE has not been used 
in ransomware operations, only that we have not seen independently verifiable 
details supporting that conclusion. Credible sources typically include some 
combination of original analysis (e.g CVE\-2021\-44228, CVE\-2022\-31199\), news 
articles that aggregate primary sources (CVE\-2022\-26134, CVE\-2022\-22954\), 
and expert commentary on open platforms (CVE\-2022\-30190\). In general, 
when a report comes from an individual or a little\-known entity rather than a 
recognized expert, we look for technical information like payloads, source IPs, 
threat actor attribution, IOCs, andor attack chain analysis to support the claim.Calculating Time to Known Exploitation (TTKE)Compiling and communicating timelines is one of the most difficult parts 
of risk assessment. When calculating Time to Known Exploitation (TTKE), 
wherever possible we will attempt to use the first credible public reference to a 
vulnerabilitys existence and the first credible public reference to exploitation in 
the wild. Often the first and most authoritative source on the existence of a new 
CVE is a vendor advisory, but in this age of widespread zero\-day exploitation 
and public discourse, community references can pre\-date vendor bulletins. 
The initial two ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities (CVE\-2022\-41040 and CVE\-2022\-
1\. are an example of this, as is CVE\-2022\-37393\. Rarely if ever do we use 
sources like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for disclosure baseline 
dates, since those dates tend to be several days or weeks behind public (and 
therefore attacker) knowledge.Important note: The first known report of exploitation is just thatthe first known 
report. Its possible, and in some cases likely, that exploitation began before a 
public analysis was released. TTKE data should not be taken as evidence that 
a vulnerability was NOT exploited before the observed date.42Glossary of TermsAttacker UtilitiesRemote code execution (RCE): 
Code execution on a remote target. Typically refers to the ability to execute 
a payload on a target system (e.g obtain a shell session). Aids in credential 
stealing, data exfiltration, and so on.Local code execution: 
The ability to run code locally on a system to which the attacker already has 
some access. Most commonly used to escalate privileges (e.g by executing 
code as the user running the vulnerable application).Cloud infrastructure compromise: 
Remote code execution or takeover of cloud gateways or API management 
products (e.g Apache APISIX, VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware vRealize 
Automation, Spring Cloud Gateway)IT security management compromise: 
Remote code execution or takeover of identity or access management products, 
including single sign\-on (SSO) and AD management solutions, or other security 
products (e.g Oracle Access Manager, ManageEngine Password Manager, 
WSO2 Identity Server, ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, Trend Micro Apex One)Network pivot: 
The ability to pivot from an external network to an internal network, most 
often by exploiting internet\-facing systems such as VPNs, firewalls, routers, 
and other gateway devices. A network pivot gives an attacker visibility into 
both internal and external traffic and aids in data exfiltration, traffic sniffing, 
and further attacks within the target network.Social engineering: 
Encompasses vulnerabilities that typically require a user to click on or preview 
a malicious attachment for successful exploitation to occurPrevious vulnerability intelligence reports have included lateral movement, 
file enumeration, and network infrastructure compromise as attacker utilities. 
The 2022 dataset does not include any file enumeration or lateral movement 
vulns, and network infrastructure compromise has been deprecated in favor of 
cloud infrastructure compromise and IT security management compromise.43Vulnerability ClassesDeserialization is the process through which an application is able to convert 
data from a portable format to data types native to its own language. Many 
modern languages support deserialization, including Java, .NET, Python, and 
Ruby. The deserialization process can pose a threat to security when the data 
that is loaded into the native language can be tampered with by a malicious 
party. Typical attacks involve configuring the data to invoke a method with the 
arguments necessary to execute an operating system command. This results 
in command execution in the context of the loading application. Common 
solutions to this security problem include cryptographically signing the data to 
ensure its authenticity and utilizing an allowlist of data types that are permitted 
to be loaded. Associated CWEs: CWE\-502\.Improper Access Control refers to a missing or insufficient access control 
to a particular interface into a system (most often a remotely accessible 
API). Improper uses of cryptography for the purpose of authentication also 
fall under this vulnerability class. Common solutions to this problem include 
proper authentication, authorization, and accounting implementations for all 
sensitive interfaces, as well as secure management of all related secrets. A 
non\-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE\-285, CWE\-200, CWE\-287, CWE\-732\.Memory Corruption is a large category of vulnerabilities that involve the misuse 
of data through a variety of means to alter memory and produce unexpected 
behavior. This vulnerability class includes improper boundary enforcement, type 
confusion, uninitialized data use, and the use of data after it has been freed, to 
name a few. These vulnerabilities often manifest themselves in languages that 
are not considered memory\-safe. Successful exploitation of memory corruption 
vulnerabilities can result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the 
running application, or in an unhandled exception that causes the application 
to crash and triggers a denial of service (DoS) condition. Common solutions 
to this problem typically involve additional validation on parameters to key 
operations, such as those used to load and store data. Successful exploitation 
of these classes of vulnerabilities has become more complex in recent years 
due to the variety of mitigation technologies that have been developed for 
operating systems, compilers, and applications (e.g kASLR, Control Flow 
Guard, win32k Type Isolation). A non\-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: 
CWE\-787, CWE\-125, CWE\-416, CWE\-190, CWE\-476\.Injection is a large category of vulnerabilities involving specially crafted input 
that is interpreted in a particular way by an associated system. Most commonly 
seen in web applications, injection attacks are often more specifically labeled 
by the type of data being interpreted (e.g SQL, LDAP, OS commands). The 
root cause of these vulnerabilities is almost always insufficient sanitization 
on data received from a malicious party. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities44tends to be reliable, rarely resulting in service degradation unless intended (such 
as through SQL or OS commands). Our 2021 report includes JNDI, OGNL, SSRF, 
and other techniques we have classified as injection flaws in addition to traditional 
OS and SQL command injection vulnerabilities.The context under which the logic is executed typically depends on how it is 
interpreted. In the case of a web application, for example, SQL injection may be 
executed on a back\-end database server, while OS commands are injected on the 
front\-end web server, and JavaScript is executed by the end users browser. This 
class of vulnerabilities is therefore unique in that it commonly involves a vulnerability 
in one system compromising the integrity of others. Common solutions to this 
problem typically involve implementing strict sanitization on parameters though 
the use of allowlists. A non\-exhaustive list of associated CWEs: CWE\-79, CWE\-20, 
CWE\-89, CWE\-94\.45ReferencesSecurity research is a community pursuit. This report benefited from the work
