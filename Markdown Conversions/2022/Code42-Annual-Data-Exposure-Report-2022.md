# Key Findings

Today, data is a company’s most valuable asset, leading many to invest in Insider Risk Management programs. Some industries, such as the Public Sector and Financial Services, are at the more mature end of the spectrum, leading the way in addressing Insider Risk. Recent trends around employee turnover and remote work have created unprecedented challenges for security teams to protect valuable data from leaving the company. There needs to be more investments around educating the Board, training employees, and increasing visibility to data movement.

Businesses are concerned that the Great Resignation is a catalyst for departing employees to unknowingly or intentionally expose, leak or exfiltrate IP

98% of business leaders, cybersecurity leaders and cybersecurity practitioners have cybersecurity concerns with levels of turnover

71% Nearly three-fourths lack visibility over what and/ or how much sensitive data departing employees take to other companies

71% The same proportion are concerned about sensitive data saved on local machines/personal hard drives and/or personal cloud storage and services

Having an Insider Risk Management program is not enough as data suggests that most companies’ programs are challenged with effectively protecting corporate data from Insider Risk

61% say they have an Insider Risk Management program, while the average cybersecurity budget allocated to mitigating Insider Risk is 21%

96% However, almost all experience challenges when it comes to protecting corporate data from Insider Risks

73% report Insider Risk is a big problem within their company

91% Lastly, 91% believe that their companies’ Board requires more understanding of Insider Risk

Training must evolve to include education for employees on the right way to handle data

Public sector and financial services industries are leading the way in Insider Risk Management

55% Over half of respondents are concerned about employees becoming lax in their cybersecurity practices with a new hybrid work environment

96% Almost all companies need to improve the data security training they provide employees, with around a third (32%) stating a complete overhaul is needed

26% & 24% Both industries are using around a quarter of their global cybersecurity budget to combat Insider Risk, on average

84% & 76% Both have the highest percentage of companies with IRM programs in place

Pre-IPO companies are making Insider Risk Management a priority, given compliance requirements and the value of IP assets in IPO transactions

77% Pre-IPO companies are most likely to have an IRM program

85% Insider Risk is a Board-level priority for 85% of pre-IPO companies, with 82% indicating Insider Risk is discussed at every Board meeting

51% Pre-IPO companies are much more likely (51%) to make Insider Risk Management a top priority, compared to those who had a major merger, acquisition or divestiture occur in the last 12 months (32%) or who have one planned in the next 12 months (26%)

# Introduction

As CISOs around the globe take stock of the cybersecurity landscape that has emerged as a result of the new hybrid-remote world, Insider Risk has emerged as a top priority - one that must be examined, understood and addressed from the top down.

Growing awareness has been driven in part by burgeoning recognition from top analyst firms that Insider Risk Management (IRM) is a significant cybersecurity challenge that must be prioritized. Gartner recently evolved the User Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) category renaming it IRM, after first recognizing the new category in December 2020. Forrester and IDC are also shining a spotlight on the importance of addressing Insider Risk.

Insider Risk is any user-driven data exposure event, either malicious, negligent or accidental in nature. Security leaders have recognized that managing Insider Risk is central to keeping their most important data - source code, product designs, customer information - from ending up in the wrong hands. The financial, reputational, privacy and compliance ramifications of sensitive data being exposed and leaked are significant. Even more significant is the risk of a company’s intellectual property (IP) ending up in the hands of a competitor.

Unfortunately, there appears to be a four-way disconnect – between cybersecurity leaders, cybersecurity practitioners, business leaders and the Board – when it comes to addressing data exposure and exfiltration as a result of Insider Risk. Research suggests this disconnect exists due to a lack of visibility into the size and scope of the data exposure and exfiltration problem, coupled with a lack of understanding across the company on its likelihood and impact. Ownership of the Insider Risk problem also remains vaguely defined.

There are many factors at play for the rise in Insider Risk concerns, but four rise to the top based on the findings in this report. First, more and more employees are leaving their jobs than ever before. Coined the Great Resignation or Big Quit, we saw a record number of employees - 4.5 million – leave their jobs in November 2021 alone. Second, there appears to be a culture of disconnect around the problem, which leads to uncertainty around ownership. Insider Risk is simply not being talked about enough from the top down or the bottom up. Third, companies need a better understanding of data movement. They don’t just need more visibility, they need better, more contextual visibility to determine what data movement poses unacceptable risk to the business. Lastly, employees are simply unaware of the risk they pose to the company. Despite massive investments in time, resources and technology and training, employee security awareness remains a challenge.

Examining data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and previous DERs from 2020 and 2021, reveals that there is a one in three (37%) chance your company loses IP when an employee quits. Comparing this to data from Verizon DBIR 2020, departing employees are the second highest cause of a successful data breach, only behind hackers (45%) and ahead of social engineering (22%), user error (22%), malware (17%) and user misuse (8%).

With a one in three chance that the company’s Intellectual Property data is walking out the door with a former employee, are you willing to take those odds?

# Objective of the Annual Data Exposure Report 2022

In past Annual Data Exposure Reports, Code42 has researched who, what, when, where, how and why employees expose and/or exfiltrate data. In the 2022 edition, we wanted to understand the impact of data exposure and exfiltration and why companies are challenged to prioritize IRM even though it has become clear over the years that Insider Risk is a persistent problem for cybersecurity teams to effectively manage.

To explore this, we surveyed 700 respondents – senior business leaders, senior cybersecurity leaders and cybersecurity practitioners – from US companies with 500 or more employees from a range of public and private sectors.

# The Great Resignation

Companies lack visibility into what types of data are leaving and how

With a record 4.5 million people quitting their jobs in November 2021, the Great Resignation rages on and it’s no wonder nearly all (98%) respondents have cybersecurity concerns about their employees leaving the company. Nearly three-fourths (71%) are concerned about lack of visibility over what and/or how much sensitive data departing employees take to other companies. The same proportion (71%) are concerned about sensitive data saved on local machines/personal hard drives and/or personal cloud storage and services. These concerns are not surprising, given real-world examples of employees taking data with them to competitors, or even worse, leveraging it to hold their former employers for ransom.

Looking specifically at the three groups surveyed, the differing concerns of business leaders, cybersecurity leaders and cybersecurity practitioners stand out. Business leaders are most concerned about lack of visibility into what types of data are leaving (49%) while cybersecurity practitioners are most likely to be concerned about data being saved on local machines or personal hard drives (52%). This highlights how business leaders are more concerned about the content of the data that is exposed, while practitioners are predictably more concerned about how data is being exposed. This is not surprising given the nature of each groups’ roles.
