## Executive Summary

The 2022 Security Culture Report (SCR) is the largest, globally recognized research into security awareness, behavior and culture available. The SCR offers unique insights which allow organizational leaders to better understand how employees view security within their organizations. This information is also leveraged by business leaders to ensure necessary investment dollars are allocated to the most critical part of the security infrastructure: the human element.

The SCR provides a number of key resources essential in understanding and measuring an organization’s security culture.

### A Standard Way to Measure and Report

This report uses the globally recognized Security Culture Index. The use of a standard index offers direct value by allowing the reader to compare the information presented in a meaningful way.

The index ranges are as follows:

*   90 up to 100 Excellent
*   80 up to 89 Good
*   70 up to 79 Moderate
*   60 up to 69 Mediocre
*   0 up to 59 Poor

...Ensure necessary investment dollars are allocated to the most critical part of the security infrastructure: the human element.

To identify where on the index an organization belongs, the Security Culture Survey (SCS) is used. Leveraged by 2,910 companies worldwide, the SCS is the most comprehensive measurement instrument available to assess an organization’s security culture.

### The Global Pandemic Improved Security Culture

The impact of the global pandemic showed that while some industry sectors have reduced their security culture significantly, others have improved. The most significant finding is that no industry is found to have Poor or Mediocre security culture scores. Although all industry sectors have a security culture that is considered Moderate, many of the industries include organizations that have been rated as Good.

### Security Culture Varies Around the World

Our results show that some regions and countries are reporting a much better security culture than others. A notable example is the United States of America, which generally trends higher on all aspects of security culture compared to other countries. Behind the USA is Europe, which has a much larger variation in security culture between countries, which results in a lower average. Africa, Asia and South America generally show a lower security culture, suggesting that more work is needed.

The impact of the global pandemic showed that while some industry sectors have reduced their security culture significantly, others have improved.

...Ensure necessary investment dollars are allocated to the most critical part of the security infrastructure: the human element.

### Industry Benchmarking With Trends

In 2022, we have introduced new graphics to the industry benchmark to make it easier to review and process. The new trend graph places the current score into context. We also provide a breakdown based on organizational size, allowing you to more accurately assess where your organization sits. Additionally, each industry benchmark is presented on a single page, making it easy to print and share only the information you need.

Security culture: The ideas, customs and social behaviors of an organization that influence their security.

### Board Level Concern

Security culture has garnered attention from board-level executives. The SCR provides all levels of executives, management and practitioners with the necessary context and data to help navigate the complexity of security within their own organization. In the ever-increasing landscape of social engineering, and the challenge that the human factors bring to any organization today, it is critical that top-level management understand the risk and the impact that security awareness, behaviors and culture has.

### Defining Security Culture

It is important to note that the phrase “security culture” is beginning to find its way into the lexicon of security leaders. CISOs and security executives now commonly cite security culture as being a critical element of their security posture. But there is a problem—security leaders have vastly different definitions of security culture, meaning that they do not really know what they are all in agreement about.

We define security culture as the ideas, customs and social behaviors that influence an organization’s security. A common definition makes it possible to discuss the same thing, in the same way. We all know that if you do not measure something, that something does not exist.

## Introduction

The SCR is produced annually by KnowBe4 Research, allowing us to analyze the security culture of thousands of organizations globally. It is the largest report ever published on this topic, with an increasing data set year-over-year. The report offers the reader insight into the state of security measures and their impact, through the human factor’s lens. As such, this unique report offers important information to the global security industry and should be used by top management within an organization to inform their security program improvements for 2022.

The first SCR was published in 2017, by the Norwegian research company CLTRe. After being acquired by KnowBe4 in 2019, the research unit became KnowBe4 Research, and is considered the leading security culture research organization in the world.

In the 2022 report, we introduce several new sections. For the first time, we can present security culture trends, exploring how industries change over time. We also presented data that helped explain the impact of the pandemic, and that should be used to understand how your industry sector performs. Additionally, we have added a regional breakdown, where we offer two different views into security culture around the world: 1) general security culture; 2) the impact that organizational size has on security culture globally.

The Security Culture Industry Benchmark offers a deep dive into each industry sector. We have made several changes to this section in this report, introducing trends and organizational size perspectives.

The 2022 SCR is divided into the following sections:

*   Introduction
*   What Is Security Culture—Definition of: security culture, 7 dimensions of security culture and the Security Culture Index
*   A Global Perspective of Security Culture—Security culture as seen around the world. This section includes information on security culture based on organizational size and across regions.
*   Security Culture Industry Trends—The evolution of security culture over time
*   Industry Benchmark—Detailed information about each industry sector
*   Method—Shares data, tables and methodology
*   About—Information about the authors and KnowBe4

This report is robust in offering a lot of industry relevant information that we are certain you will find value in.

## Changes in the Security Culture Report 2022

The following new sections have been added to the 2022 report:

*   A Global Perspective on Security Culture—Regional data breakdown of Europe, USA, Canada and Latin America with regional map visualizations. This section also includes security culture as measured by organizational size – security culture and dimension scores by size of organizations: small, medium and large.
*   Trends—How different industries have performed regarding security culture over the past two to three years.

These new sections have one thing in common—the data is represented visually via graphs and maps. We believe visualizing the data makes the information easier to digest. However, if you prefer to see the actual numbers in table format, you can find this in the Methodology section.

To make space for all this new content, the Detailed Analysis of Security Culture section was removed. Our plans are to publish this type of analysis in a different report in the future. Additionally, the Comparing Dimensions Scores Across Industries section has been discontinued with the data now available on each industry page.

Another change this year is the Industry Benchmark section. This year, the boxplots have been removed to allow space for trend data on all dimensions and an analysis of scores by organizational size. We are excited about this change, as it allows for a more detailed and long-term perspective on security culture. For those still interested in the statistics associated with the boxplot, you can find these in the Methodology section.

Lastly, there have been some changes to the industries included in this year’s report.

*   Internet and Software Services, which was previously in the Other category, is now in Technology.
*   Hospitality, also in the Other category, is now an independent benchmark.
*   SCS data where the industry is unknown has been removed and therefore has eliminated the Other category.

Our continuous content review and subsequent changes allow us to keep providing you with the most relevant and useful data available.

## Security Culture—A High‑Level Perspective

In this section, we offer a brief overview of what security culture is.

### What Is Security Culture

We define security culture as: The ideas, customs and social behaviors that influence an organization’s security.

This definition makes it clear that security culture is a combination of thought processes and knowledge, the habits that employees have adapted and the behaviors that are demonstrated when in the workplace. By workplace, we mean any such place where employees perform their work. We define security broadly.

With this definition in mind, organizations should focus their efforts on a combination of employee engagement with assessments and training, improve process and procedures and by implementing technology that makes it easy for the employee to do the right thing.

For more in-depth information on what security culture is, and how to successfully implement a security culture program at your organization, refer to The Security Culture Playbook, An Executive Guide To Reducing Risk and Developing Your Human Defense Layer by Perry Carpenter and Kai Roer (Wiley, 2022).

## Security Culture Dimensions

We systematically evaluate culture across seven distinct dimensions:

*   **Attitudes**: The feelings and beliefs that employees have toward the security protocols and issues.
*   **Behaviors**: The actions and activities of employees that have direct or indirect impact on the security of the organization.
*   **Cognition**: Employees’ understanding, knowledge and awareness of security issues and activities.
*   **Communication**: The quality of communication channels to discuss security-related topics, promote a sense of belonging and provide support for security issues and incident reporting.
*   **Compliance**: The knowledge of written security policies and the extent that employees follow them.
*   **Norms**: The knowledge of and adherence to unwritten rules of conduct in the organization.
*   **Responsibilities**: How employees perceive their role as a critical factor in sustaining or endangering the security of the organization.

### Security Culture Index

The Security Culture Index (SCI) is the global index for rating organizations based on their security culture score. The index was created by the team of researchers at KnowBe4 Research and is calculated by analyzing the security culture of thousands of organizations around the world. More details on the index itself, and the direct risk attached to each level, can be found in the research paper Security Culture and Credential Sharing, available for download at: https://get.clt.re/credential-sharing-research/

*   90 up to 100 Excellent
*   80 up to 89 Good
*   70 up to 79 Moderate
*   60 up to 69 Mediocre
*   0 up to 59 Poor

Note: None of the industry sectors have demonstrated Excellent or Good security culture this year.

## The Security Culture Maturity Model

The data-driven and evidence-based Security Culture Maturity Model, developed by KnowBe4 Research, is the industry’s first maturity model specifically geared to measure security culture. The model is fueled by KnowBe4’s massive security awareness, behavior and culture dataset.

### The Five Maturity Levels

The model’s range accounts for organizations with no formal or intentional awareness, behavior or culture plan other than to achieve basic compliance (Level 1) all the way up to the most sophisticated organizations that seek to push beyond the pack and are actively working to shape even the unwritten rules and social dynamics of how their employees value security. Learn more about these levels below.

*   **Level 1: Basic Compliance**
    *   Bare minimum of training
    *   “Check the box”
*   **Level 2: Security Awareness Foundation**
    *   At least annual and onboarding training
    *   Occasional phishing simulations
    *   Focus on variety of content
    *   Limited metrics
*   **Level 3: Programmatic Security Awareness & Behavior**
    *   Intentional awareness program with integrated tools
    *   Quarterly training with simulated phishing
    *   Focus on security-aware behaviors
*   **Level 4: Security Behavior Management**
    *   Continuous training across varied delivery methods and audiences
    *   Heavy use of integrated tools to inform training strategy

## A Global Perspective on Security Culture

Measuring security culture is a global concern. Understanding the security culture of your workplace is proving increasingly important for the security posture of the organization. As we demonstrated in the 2021 SCR, 9/10 global security leaders believe that security culture is a critical factor to their successful implementation of a security program. The gap between the acceptance of security culture being critical and the implementation of a security culture program, is demonstrated by the lack of data from many countries. Of particular interest, outside Europe and North America, we have noted a dramatic drop in organizations measuring security culture, leaving them blindsided when it comes to assessing the human factors of security.

Below, we share regional breakdowns for your reference, but the important message is that organizations must step up their game and invest in security awareness, behavior and culture in the years to come. This is not a nice to have, it is a critical asset used to reduce risk and improve security.

Security culture is found in every organization, all around the world. In this section, we are comparing security culture and commenting on the observations and measurements. When looking at security culture from a satellite perspective, the variation between regions is small, with only two points between the worst performing and the best performing.

### Global Overview

North America scored 74 (the best), with the rest of the world comparable to Europe and Asia scoring 73, and Latin America, Africa and Oceania scoring 72.

This global overview easily gives a false understanding—that all regions perform similarly and that things are not too bad. But the reality is more nuanced, and shocking,
