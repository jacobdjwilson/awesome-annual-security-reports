## Executive summary

The Cost of a Data Breach Report offers IT, risk management and security leaders a lens into factors that can increase or help mitigate the rising cost of data breaches.

Now in its 17th year, this research — conducted independently by Ponemon Institute, and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM Security® — studied 550 organizations impacted by data breaches that occurred between March 2021 and March 2022. The breaches occurred across 17 countries and regions and in 17 different industries.

We conducted more than 3,600 interviews with individuals from organizations that were impacted by the data breaches. During the interviews, we asked questions to determine the cost to organizations across different activities related directly to both the immediate and prolonged response to the data breaches.

As in previous years’ reports, this year’s data provides a view of how dozens of factors impact the costs that keep adding up after a data breach occurs. Additionally, the report examines root causes, short-term and long-term consequences of data breaches, and the mitigating factors and technologies that allowed companies to limit losses.

## What’s new in the 2022 report

With each year’s edition, we aim to build upon past research to keep up with changing technology and events. We also try to form a more relevant picture of the risks and strategies for securing data and responding to a breach, from artificial intelligence (AI) to zero trust. Covering some of the technologies most companies focused on in the past year, the 2022 edition of this report has new analysis related to the value of the following:
- Extended detection and response (XDR)
- The use of risk quantification techniques
- Impacts of individual technologies that contribute to a zero trust security framework, such as identity and access management (IAM) and multifactor authentication (MFA)

Furthermore, the report takes a broader look at some leading contributors to higher data breach costs. For the first time, the report looks at the effects of supply chain compromises and the security skills gap.

The report examines areas of security vulnerability from the cloud to critical infrastructure. And we take a deeper dive than past years into the impacts of ransomware and destructive attacks. Also studied is the phenomenon of remote work that continues to be a reality for many organizations past the peak of the COVID pandemic.

As companies experience more breaches and costs continue to climb, this report can serve as a tool to help your teams better manage risk and limit potential losses.
The report is divided into the following five major sections:
- The executive summary with key findings and what’s new in the 2022 edition
- In-depth analysis on the complete findings, including breach costs by geographic region and industry
- Security recommendations from IBM Security experts based on this report’s results
- Demographics of organizations and industry definitions
- The study’s methodology, including how costs were calculated

IBM Security and Ponemon Institute are pleased to present the results of the 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report.

Significantly, for the first time, the research shows the following insights:

- 83% of organizations studied have had more than one data breach.
- 60% of organizations’ breaches led to increases in prices passed on to customers.
- 79% of critical infrastructure organizations didn’t deploy a zero trust architecture.
- 19% of breaches occurred because of a compromise at a business partner.
- 45% of the breaches were cloud-based.

## Key findings

The key findings described here are based on IBM Security analysis of research data compiled by Ponemon Institute.¹

### USD 4.35 million
Average total cost of a data breach

Reaching an all-time high, the cost of a data breach averaged USD 4.35 million in 2022. This figure represents a 2.6% increase from last year, when the average cost of a breach was USD 4.24 million. The average cost has climbed 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report.

### 83%
Percentage of organizations that have had more than one breach

Eighty-three percent of organizations studied have experienced more than one data breach, and just 17% said this was their first data breach. Sixty percent of organizations studied stated that they increased the price of their services or products because of the data breach.

The average cost of a data breach for critical infrastructure organizations studied was USD 4.82 million — USD 1 million more than the average cost for organizations in other industries. Critical infrastructure organizations included those in the financial services, industrial, technology, energy, transportation, communication, healthcare, education and public sector industries. Twenty-eight percent experienced a destructive or ransomware attack, while 17% experienced a breach because of a business partner being compromised.

Breaches at organizations with fully deployed security AI and automation cost USD 3.05 million less than breaches at organizations with no security AI and automation deployed. This 65.2% difference in average breach cost — between USD 3.15 million for fully deployed versus USD 6.20 million for not deployed — represented the largest cost savings in the study. Companies with fully deployed security AI and automation also experienced on average a 74-day shorter time to identify and contain the breach, known as the breach lifecycle, than those without security AI and automation — 249 days versus 323 days. The use of security AI and automation jumped by nearly one-fifth in two years, from 59% in 2020 to 70% in 2022.

### USD 4.82 million
Average cost of a critical infrastructure data breach

### USD 3.05 million
Average cost savings associated with fully deployed security AI and automation

¹ Cost amounts in this report are measured in US dollars (USD).

### USD 4.54 million
Average cost of a ransomware attack, not including the cost of the ransom itself

Eleven percent of breaches in the study were ransomware attacks, an increase from 2021, when 7.8% of breaches were ransomware, for a growth rate of 41%. The average cost of a ransomware attack went down slightly, from USD 4.62 million in 2021 to USD 4.54 million in 2022. This cost was slightly higher than the overall average total cost of a data breach, USD 4.35 million.

### 19%
Frequency of breaches caused by stolen or compromised credentials

### 59%
Percentage of organizations that don’t deploy zero trust

### USD 1 million
Average difference in cost where remote work was a factor in causing the breach versus when it wasn’t a factor

### 45%
Share of breaches that occurred in the cloud

Use of stolen or compromised credentials remains the most common cause of a data breach. Stolen or compromised credentials were the primary attack vector in 19% of breaches in the 2022 study and also the top attack vector in the 2021 study, having caused 20% of breaches. Breaches caused by stolen or compromised credentials had an average cost of USD 4.50 million. These breaches had the longest lifecycle — 243 days to identify the breach, and another 84 days to contain the breach. Phishing was the second most common cause of a breach at 16% and also the costliest, averaging USD 4.91 million in breach costs.

Just 41% of organizations in the study said they deploy a zero trust security architecture. The other 59% percent of organizations that don’t deploy zero trust incur an average of USD 1 million in greater breach costs compared to those that do deploy. Among critical infrastructure organizations, an even higher percentage of 79% doesn’t deploy zero trust. These organizations experienced on average USD 5.40 million in breach costs, more than USD 1 million higher than the global average.

When remote working was a factor in causing the breach, costs were an average of nearly USD 1 million greater than in breaches where remote working wasn’t a factor — USD 4.99 million versus USD 4.02 million. Remote work-related breaches cost on average about USD 600,000 more compared to the global average.

Forty-five percent of breaches in the study occurred in the cloud. Yet breaches that happened in a hybrid cloud environment cost an average of USD 3.80 million, compared to USD 4.24 million for breaches in private clouds and USD 5.02 million for breaches in public clouds. The cost difference was 27.6% between hybrid cloud breaches and public cloud breaches. Organizations with a hybrid cloud model also had shorter breach lifecycles than organizations that solely adopted a public or private cloud model.

### USD 2.66 million
Average cost savings associated with an incident response (IR) team and regularly tested IR plan

Nearly three-quarters of organizations in the study said they had an IR plan, while 63% of those organizations said they regularly tested the plan. Having an IR team and an IR plan that was regularly tested led to significant cost savings. Businesses with an IR team that tested its IR plan saw an average of USD 2.66 million lower breach costs than organizations without an IR team and that don’t test an IR plan. The difference of USD 3.26 million versus USD 5.92 million represents a 58% cost savings.

### 29 days
Savings in response time for those with extended detection and response (XDR) technologies

### 12 years
Consecutive years the healthcare industry had the highest average cost of a breach

### USD 9.44 million
Average cost of a breach in the United States, the highest of any country

XDR technologies were implemented by 44% of organizations. Those organizations with XDR technologies saw considerable advantages in response times. Those organizations with XDR deployed shortened the breach lifecycle by about a month, on average, compared to organizations that didn’t implement XDR. Specifically, organizations took 275 days to identify and contain a breach with XDR deployed versus 304 days without XDR deployed. This figure represents a 10% difference in response times.

Healthcare breach costs hit a new record high. The average breach in healthcare increased by nearly USD 1 million to reach USD 10.10 million. Healthcare breach costs have been the most expensive industry for 12 years running, increasing by 41.6% since the 2020 report. Financial organizations had the second highest costs — averaging USD 5.97 million — followed by pharmaceuticals at USD 5.01 million, technology at USD 4.97 million and energy at USD 4.72 million.

The top five countries and regions for the highest average cost of a data breach were the United States at USD 9.44 million, the Middle East at USD 7.46 million, Canada at USD 5.64 million, the United Kingdom at USD 5.05 million and Germany at USD 4.85 million. The United States has led the list for 12 years in a row. Meanwhile, the country with the fastest growth rate over last year was Brazil, a 27.8% increase from USD 1.08 million to USD 1.38 million.

## Global highlights

The Cost of a Data Breach Report is a global report, comprising data from 17 countries and regions and 17 industries. In this section, we look at several key metrics at the level of global average, as well as comparative costs between countries and between industries.

### Figure 1: The average cost of a data breach reached a record high in 2022.
The global average total cost of a data breach increased by USD 0.11 million to USD 4.35 million in 2022, the highest it’s been in the history of this report. The increase from USD 4.24 million in the 2021 report to USD 4.35 million in the 2022 report represents a 2.6% increase. In the last two years, the average total cost has increased 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report.

### Figure 2: The per record cost of a data breach hit a seven-year high.
The global per record cost of a data breach in 2022 was USD 164, a 1.9% increase from USD 161 in 2021. The increase from USD 146 in 2020 is an increase of 12.3%. This study examines breaches sized between 2,200 and 102,000 records. It’s not consistent with this research to use the per record cost to calculate the cost of single or multiple breaches above 102,000 records. For more information, see the “Research methodology” section.

The United States had the highest average total cost of a data breach at USD 9.44 million, a 4.3% increase of USD 0.39 million, up from USD 9.05 million in 2021. Similar to last year, the Middle East region again had the second highest average total cost of a data breach, increasing from USD 6.93 million in 2021 to USD 7.46 million in 2022. This average cost was an increase of USD 0.53 million, or 7.6%. Canada was again the third highest cost country at USD 5.64 million, an increase of USD 0.24 million or 4.4%. The United Kingdom climbed to number four from eighth out of the 17 countries or regions, surpassing Germany, Japan and France in the ranking. The average total cost of a breach in the United Kingdom was USD 5.05 million, up from USD 4.67 million, an increase of USD 0.38 million, or 8.1%.

Out of the 17 countries or regions studied, six — Germany, Japan, France, South Korea, Scandinavia and Turkey — saw a decrease in the average total cost of a data breach. Brazil, 16th on the list at USD 1.38 million, saw the largest relative cost increase, up USD 0.3 million or 27.8%. Turkey, 17th on the list, saw the largest relative cost decrease, falling from USD 1.91 million to USD 1.11 million, a decrease of USD 0.8 million or 42%. Broad swings in currency valuations, such as occurred in Turkey, can play a role in cost variations from year to year.

### Figure 4: Healthcare was highest cost industry for the 12th year in a row.
The average total cost of a breach in healthcare increased from USD 9.23 million in the 2021 report to USD 10.10 million in 2022, an increase of USD 0.87 million or 9.4%. Healthcare is one of the more highly regulated industries and is considered critical infrastructure by the US government.

The top five industries by cost were unchanged in the order of ranking from the 2021 report. Following healthcare were the financial, pharmaceuticals, technology and energy industries. The financial industry saw an increase from USD 5.72 million in 2021 to USD 5.97 million in 2022, an increase of USD 0.25 million or 4.4%. The industrial industry, comprised of chemical, engineering and manufacturing organizations, saw an increase from USD 4.24 million to USD 4.47 million in 2022, an increase of USD 0.23 million or 5.4%. The average total cost decreased slightly in four industries — pharmaceuticals, transportation, media and hospitality.

Healthcare is one of the more highly regulated industries and is considered critical infrastructure by the US government.

*Average cost of a data breach by industry*
- **Healthcare**: 2022 $10.10 million, 2021 $9.23 million
- **Financial**: 2022 $5.97 million, 2021 $5.72 million

### Figure 5: Detection and escalation costs surpassed lost business costs as the largest of four cost categories comprising the cost of a data breach, for the first time in six years.
Broken down into four cost categories — lost business, detection and escalation, notification and post breach response — the largest share of data breach costs in 2022 was detection and escalation. Detection and escalation costs increased from USD 1.24 million in 2021 to USD 1.44 million in 2022, an increase of USD 0.2 million or 16.1%. Detection and escalation costs include activities that enable a company to reasonably detect a breach. These costs include forensic and investigative activities; assessment and audit services; crisis management; and communications to executives and boards.

For the first time in at least six years, lost business, at USD 1.42 million in 2022, wasn’t the largest share of data breach costs. Lost business costs decreased from USD 1.59 million in 2021, a decrease of 10.7%. Lost business costs include activities that attempt to minimize the loss of customers, business disruption and revenue losses. These costs include business disruption and revenue losses from system downtime; cost of lost customers and acquiring new customers; and reputation losses and diminished goodwill.

Notification costs and post breach response costs remained relatively unchanged from 2021 to 2022. See “How we calculate the cost of a data breach” in the “Research methodology” section for definitions of each of the four cost categories.

*Average cost of a data breach divided into four segments*
- **2017**: Notification $0.16M, Post breach response $0.93M, Detection and escalation $1.02M, Lost business $1.51M
- **2018**: Notification $0.21M, Post breach response $0.99M, Detection and escalation $1.07M, Lost business $1.59M
- **2019**: Notification $0.24M, Post breach response $0.99M, Detection and escalation $1.14M, Lost business $1.42M
- **2020**: Notification $0.27M, Post breach response $1.18M, Detection and escalation $1.23M, Lost business $1.42M
- **2021**: Notification $0.31M, Post breach response $1.11M, Detection and escalation $1.24M, Lost business $1.59M
- **2022**: Notification $0.31M, Post breach response $1.11M, Detection and escalation $1.44M, Lost business $1.42M

### Figure 6: Most organizations in the study have experienced more than one data breach.
Of the 550 organizations in the study, just 17% said this was their first data breach. Eighty-three percent said this wasn’t their first data breach. With security teams handling more incidents every year and considering the impact of remote work on security, it’s likely the recurrence of breaches is climbing.

*Was this your first data breach?*
- Yes: 17%
- No: 83%

### Figure 7: A majority of organizations in the study said they increased the price of their products and services as a result of the data breach.
In response to the question, 60% said they increased prices, and 40% said they didn’t increase prices.

*Did the data breach result in your organization increasing the price of products and services?*
- Yes: 60%
- No: 40%

## Data breach lifecycle

The time elapsed between the first detection of the breach and its containment is referred to as the data breach lifecycle. The time to identify a breach describes the time it takes to detect that an incident has occurred. The time to contain a breach refers to the time it takes for an organization to resolve a situation when it’s been detected and ultimately restore service. These metrics can be used to determine the effectiveness of an organization’s incident response and containment processes.

### Figure 8: The mean or average time to identify and contain a data breach fell from 287 days in 2021 to 277 days in 2022, a decrease of 10 days or 3.5%.
In 2022 it took an average of 207 days to identify the breach and 70 days to contain the breach. In 2021 it took an average of 212 days to identify the breach and 75 days to contain the breach. The 277-day average in 2022 means that if a breach occurred on January 1, it would take until October 4 of that year to identify and contain the breach. The 277-day average is consistent with the average over the past seven years, with a maximum difference of 11% between the lowest total, 257 days in 2017, and the highest total, 287 days in 2021.

*Average time to identify and contain a data breach*
- **2016**: Identify 201 days, Contain 70 days, Total 271 days
- **2017**: Identify 191 days, Contain 66 days, Total 257 days
- **2018**: Identify 197 days, Contain 69 days, Total 266 days
- **2019**: Identify 206 days, Contain 73 days, Total 279 days
- **2020**: Identify 207 days, Contain 73 days, Total 280 days
- **2021**: Identify 212 days, Contain 75 days, Total 287 days
- **2022**: Identify 207 days, Contain 70 days, Total 277 days

### 277 days
Average time to identify and contain a data breach

### Figure 9: A shorter data breach lifecycle continues to be associated with lower data breach costs.
A data breach lifecycle of less than 200 days was associated with an average cost of USD 3.74 million in 2022, compared to USD 4.86 million for breaches with a lifecycle of greater than 200 days. This difference represents an average cost savings of USD 1.12 million, or 26.5%, for breaches with the shorter than 200-day lifecycle.

The cost gap between a lifecycle longer than 200 days and a lifecycle shorter than 200 days was smaller in 2022 than in 2021, when it was USD 1.26 million. The cost gap in 2022 — USD 1.12 million — is the same size as the cost gap in 2020. The cost gap has grown slightly over the past seven years, while the average cost of a data breach has also grown incrementally. The 2021 cost gap of USD 1.26 million was the largest of the past seven years.

*Average cost of a data breach based on data breach lifecycle*
- **2016**: Lifecycle < 200 days $2.54M, Lifecycle > 200 days $3.61M
- **2017**: Lifecycle < 200 days $2.79M, Lifecycle > 200 days $3.21M
- **2018**: Lifecycle < 200 days $3.34M, Lifecycle > 200 days $4.15M
- **2019**: Lifecycle < 200 days $3.61M, Lifecycle > 200 days $4.33M
- **2020**: Lifecycle < 200 days $3.75M, Lifecycle > 200 days $4.15M
- **2021**: Lifecycle < 200 days $3.61M, Lifecycle > 200 days $4.87M
- **2022**: Lifecycle < 200 days $3.74M, Lifecycle > 200 days $4.86M

### Figures 10a and 10b: Data breaches in high data protection regulatory environments, such as the healthcare, financial, energy, pharmaceuticals and education industries, tended to see costs accrue in later years following the breach.
The difference between low and high regulatory environments showed up in a pronounced way two years or more after the data breach — the “longtail” costs. In highly regulated industries, an average of 24% of data breach costs were accrued more than two years after the breach occurred. This result compares to an average of 8% of costs accrued more than two years after a breach in low regulatory environments.

In low regulatory environments, data breach costs tended to accrue in the first three to six months — where an average of 24% of data breach costs accrued. In the overall average for 2022, 52% of costs were incurred in the first 12 months, 29% in the second year after the breach and 19% more than two years after the breach. For highly regulated industries, 45% of costs accrued in the first year, 31% in the second year and 24% more than two years after the breach.

In the analysis of industries in the high regulation categories, we concluded that regulatory and legal costs may have contributed to higher costs in the years following a breach.

Note: This analysis was comprised of a subset of 218 companies with historical data from previous breaches.

*Time elapsed*
- **0–3 months**: 2022 average 52%, Low regulation 24%, High regulation 45%
- **3–6 months**: 2022 average 29%, Low regulation 17%, High regulation 31%
- **6–9 months**: 2022 average 19%, Low regulation 16%, High regulation 13%
