The C-suite guide to simplifying for cyber readiness,
today and tomorrow

## Investments continue to pour into cybersecurity.

More than 25% expect double-digit growth in cyber budgets in 2022

Sixty-nine percent of organisations predict a rise in cyber spending in 2022 compared to 55% last year. More than a quarter (26%) predict cyber spending hikes of 10% or more; only 8% percent said that last year.

Organisations know that risks are increasing.

More than 50% expect a surge in reportable incidents next year above 2021 levels.

Already, 2021 is shaping up to be one of the worst on record for cybersecurity. Ever more sophisticated attackers are plumbing the dark corners of our systems and networks, seeking — and finding — vulnerabilities. Whatever the nature of an organisation’s digital Achilles’ heel — an unprotected server containing 50 million records, for example, or a flaw in the code controlling access to crypto wallets — attackers will use every means at their disposal, traditional as well as ultra-sophisticated, to exploit it.

The consequences for an attack rise as our systems’ interdependencies grow more and more complex. Critical infrastructures are especially vulnerable. And yet, many of the breaches we’re seeing are still preventable with sound cyber practices and strong controls.

![Chart showing cyber budget changes in 2022. 26% expect increasing by 6%-10%, 18% by 5% or less, 15% decreasing, 12% no change, 12% increasing by 15% or more, 14% increasing by 11%-14%, 4% unknown.](chart-1.png)

## Simplifying cyber

Cybersecurity scorecards: 4 out of 10 organisations report significant progress in the past two years on four fronts

Instilling a culture of cybersecurity
Increased engagement of CEO in cybersecurity matters
46%
As digital connections multiply, they form increasingly complex webs that grow more intricate with each new technology. Having a smart phone enables us to carry a variety of “devices” — telephone, camera, calendar, TV, health tracker, an entire library of books, and so much more — in our pocket, simplifying our lives in many ways and letting us work on the go. The Internet of Things lets us perform myriad tasks by uttering a simple command, enables factories to all but run themselves, and lets our healthcare providers monitor our health from a distance.
43%
But the processes needed to manage and maintain all these connections — including cybersecurity — are getting more complicated, too. Runaway complexity evokes the Lernaean Hydra from Greek mythology: cut off one head, and two grow in its place.
Increased employee report rate on phishing tests
43%
Is the business world now too complex to secure? Leaders are sounding the alarm.
Cyber risk management
43%
Some 75% of respondents to our 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey say that too much avoidable, unnecessary organisational complexity poses “concerning” cyber and privacy risks.
Increased number of cyber and privacy assessments before project implementation
42%
But because some complexities are necessary, your enterprise shouldn’t streamline and simplify its operations and processes thoughtlessly, but consciously and deliberately.
Improved management of security policy exceptions
42%
This 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey offers the C-suite a guide to simplifying cyber with intention. It focuses on four questions that tend to get short shrift but, if properly considered, can yield significant dividends.
Communications between management and board
41%
Increased amount of time allotted for discussion of cybersecurity at board meetings
Increased assessment of board understanding of cyber matters
Aligning cyber with overall business goals
Increased alignment of cyber strategy to business strategy
Increased percentage of overall risk remediation being completed by proposed deadlines from security team

## These questions may surprise and even challenge you because, in a survey about data trust, they aren’t technology-centered. Tech, in itself, is not the answer to simplified security.

Our focus, instead, is on working together as a unified whole, from the tech stack to the board room — starting at the top with the CEO. Security is a concern for the entire business, in every function and for every employee.

1.  How can CEOs make a difference to your organisation?
2.  Is your organisation too complex to secure?
3.  How do you know if you’re securing your organisation against the most important risks to your business?
4.  How well do you know your third-party and supply chain risks?

Based on respondents’ answers to these questions, we determined the top 10% of organisations that are most advanced in their practices. These most advanced are twice as likely to report significant progress on important cyber goals: instilling a culture of cybersecurity, managing cyber risk, enhancing communication between boards and management, and coordinating cyber strategy with business strategy.

![Diagram showing that the top 10% most advanced in four areas (engaged CEO, streamlined organisation, data trust, secure ecosystems) are twice as likely to report significant progress in four outcomes (cyber risk management, culture, alignment with business, communication between board and management) compared to the rest.](diagram-4.png)
PwC analyses of data based on 3,602 survey respondents.

The top 10% reporting significant progress toward meeting these goals — the most improved — are many times more likely to be doing the right things.

- 5x more likely to have streamlined operations enterprise wide
- 10x more likely to have a formal process fully implemented for data trust practices
- 11x more likely to have high levels of understanding of cyber and privacy risks from third parties
- 12x more likely to say their CEOs give them the support they need
- 18x more likely to state data and intel tools and approaches are integral to their operating model
- 34x more likely to say they have achieved public-private sector collaboration goals ‘very effectively’

## Multiplying the effect: simplifying moves that get you 5x or more results

Strategists and technologists have touted the potential of digital business models to boost business 10x — a Holy Grail promise of exponential returns on digital investments.

Likewise, the Survey reveals how simplifying business processes and operations can have a “multiplier” effect on security and privacy.

Here are the four Ps to realising your full cyber potential, as exemplified by most advanced and most improved organisations, who employ them all.

As common-sense as these precepts and practices might seem, they’re not commonplace. Only the top 10% have adopted them and they also report making significant progress toward their cyber objectives during the past two years.

On the other hand, many enterprises continue to struggle amid risky, runaway, befuddling complexity. Bad habits are often why: Using many tech solutions that, too often, don’t even work together. Not coordinating the work of various functions on resilience or third-party risk management. Not creating and adhering to processes for dealing with data (governance). Not speaking in the language of business when talking about cyber.

Principle. The CEO must articulate an explicit, unambiguous foundational principle establishing security and privacy as a business imperative.

Businesses develop these bad habits in the name of speed, or they accept and assimilate them out of resistance to change.

People. Hire the right leader, and let CISO and security teams connect with the business teams. Your people can be vanguards of simplification even as you build “good complexity” in the business.

The good thing, however, is that bad habits can be broken. And C-suite champions can help develop new habits of coordination and collaboration among all functions, business and tech, for an organisation that’s simply secure.

Prioritisation. Your risks continually change as your digital ambitions rise. Use data and intelligence to measure your risks continually, as well.

Perception. You can’t secure what you can’t see. Uncover blind spots in your relationships and supply chains.

Make ‘simply secure’ your business mantra

Cyber has got CEOs’ attention, but are they taking action?

Chief executives cited cyber threats as the number-two risk to business prospects in PwC’s 24th Annual CEO Survey — topped only by pandemics and other health crises. In North America and Western Europe, cyber was number one.

Our findings from the 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey suggest an “expectations gap” for cyber, with CEOs perceiving that they are more involved in, and supportive of, setting and achieving cyber goals than their teams do. A persistent gap can spell disaster if it instills a false sense of security company-wide, given the CEO’s leading role in defining an organisation’s culture.

How involved are CEOs in cyber? We asked nearly 700 CEOs and 2,900 other C-suite execs.

Many CEOs self-identify as engaged and strategic in their approaches to cyber. Our CEO respondents indicate that they participate in discussions about the cyber and privacy implications of mergers and acquisitions, future changes to their operating model, and future strategy.

Other executives don’t view things in quite the same way. Non-CEOs rated their CEOs as more reactive than proactive regarding cybersecurity. They say the chief executive is most likely to take part in cyber and privacy matters after a company breach or when contacted by regulators — not before.

Among our respondents, CEOs tend to see themselves as more involved in cybersecurity than others in the organisation do.

Question: What level of support do you/does your CEO provide your cyber leadership to accomplish the following?
Base: Non-CEO Respondents: 2,929; CEO Respondents: 673
Source: PwC, 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights, October 2021.

For instance, 37% of CEOs said they provide significant support for “ensuring adequate resources, funding and sufficient priority” to cyber, while only 30% of non-CEOs agreed that their CEOs do so.

And 34% of CEOs say they provide significant help to cyber leadership with “reducing investors’ uncertainty regarding organisational cyber risks” — while just 29% of non-CEOs agree. Thirty-six percent of CEOs say they empower their cyber leadership to connect with customers and business partners, while only 30% of non-CEOs say cyber gets that kind of support.

CEOs matter. CEOs in our “most improved” group (those with the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years) are 14x more likely to provide significant support across all categories. Similarly, the non-CEOs in the most improved group are 12x more likely to say their CEOs provide that significant boost.

The CEO’s engagement and support wield long-term importance. Executives in most regions and industries say the most important act for a more secure digital society by 2030 is educating CEOs and boards so they can better fulfill their cyber duties and responsibilities.

It’s time to close the expectations gap between the chief executives and the others in the C-suite regarding the level of CEO involvement and support of cybersecurity. Things seem headed in the right direction: Interactions with the CEO on cyber matters have increased significantly in the past two years, according to 46% of our survey respondents.

## CEOs and other executives agree on the changing cyber mission

Cybersecurity’s mission is shifting to developing trust and business growth

Asked how CEOs frame the cyber mission in their organisation, more than half (54%) of the CEOs chose bigger-picture, growth-related objectives from their security team, as opposed to narrower, shorter-term expectations.

Non-CEOs echoed this mindset. In both groups, “a way to establish trust with our customers with respect to how we use their data ethically and protect their data” was the number-one cyber mission choice. CEOs really do set the tone for the rest of the organisation.

CEOs and non-CEOs name similar top goals for cyber in the next three years. These objectives mirror the famous Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, with prevention as the baseline, or most important; resilience coming next; followed by trust (including consumer trust: “improved customer experience” and “higher customer loyalty” rank fifth and seventh, respectively).

Protection, resilience and trust comprise the three legs of the cybersecurity stool, each important for the security of the business overall.

Narrow framing of mission and expectations from security team
16%
A way to put controls throughout the organisation to prevent serious cyber disruptions
17%
A way of operating so the organisation responds faster to threats and emerges stronger from disruptions

## How can CEOs make a difference to their organisation’s cybersecurity?

The top 10% that are “most advanced” in cyber practices or “most improved” on cyber outcomes are in a good position. But the majority overall — 63% of organisations — don’t get the kind of support they need from their CEO. The fact is, both the CEO and CISO need to work together better to benefit the company.

A related CEO imperative: empowering your CISO to carry out the cybersecurity mission, voicing support and providing resources for secure-by-design, secure-by-default processes. Some may add the CISO to the C-suite. Others may help the CISO communicate more with the board or revamp the enterprise’s structure to embed security staff on business teams. Empowering CISOs may also mean giving them the platform to speak outside the organisation to customers about its security and privacy initiatives, as a trust officer would.

CEO: How much should you be involved in your organisation’s cybersecurity — without taking on undue burden?

A powerful CEO move: making an explicit statement establishing an imperative for security and privacy organisation-wide. In some cases, the organisation’s mission statement is already implicitly supportive, such as Liberty Mutual’s mission statement to “help people live safer, more secure lives.” Red Bull’s dedication to distinguished products and services gives its CISO the mandate to make security an integral part of the product and service quality delivered to customers.

12 | PwC 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights

## CISO: How well do you understand the business?

How connected are you with leaders on the business side?

This period of great complexity in the business world demands a third CEO imperative. The CEO must modify certain elements of the company’s business and/or operating models to make the company “simply secure” when the security team identifies wasteful habits. For example, in the name of speed, a “get to market first, fix security later” mindset prevails. Companies aren’t fully mitigating remote work risks. Business units often buy technologies and contract with third parties autonomously. Cybersecurity is too often an afterthought in cloud adoption or transformation.

For an organisation that’s simply secure, CISOs must move out of the technology trenches and broaden their outreach — learning from the CFO how to talk about the financial implications of risk, for example, in a language the board understands, or working with the product manager to devise developer-friendly ways to secure applications.

By taking action, the CEO reinforces a zero-tolerance mentality for complexity that gets in the way of security.

CISOs interact most frequently with the CIO and chief technology officer, our survey shows, and least frequently with the chief marketing officer and product management leader. The CFO also ranks low on the interactions list. CISO will need to spend more time with these business partners to begin to speak their language and better understand their business imperatives.

More than 21% placed the CEO among the three positions with whom they least come in contact; some 10% placed the CEO at the very bottom of the list. The CEO-CISO divide is widest in Europe: 27% of CISOs in western Europe and 28% in eastern Europe placed their chief executive among the bottom three with whom they interact, followed by Asia Pacific (21%) and North America (19%).

13 | PwC 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights

## Takeaways

For the CEO

*   Frame cybersecurity as important to business growth and customer trust — not just defense and controls — to create a security mindset organisation-wide.
*   Demonstrate your trust in and steadfast support for your CISO.
*   Come to grips with the problems and risks in your business models and change what needs to be changed. You’ll have lots of opportunities to follow Peter Drucker’s advice: “Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.”

For the CISO

*   Familiarise yourself with your organisation’s business strategy.
*   Build a stronger relationship with your CEO, and keep the dialogue going to help your CEO clear the way for simply secure practices.
*   Equip yourself with the skills you need to thrive in the evolving, expanding role for cyber in business. And reorient your teams, if you haven’t already, towards business value and customer trust.

Questions: In your view, how complex are the following operations in your organisation, on a scale of 1 to 10? How significant are the cyber and privacy risks posed by complexity in these areas in your organisation?
Base: 3,602 respondents
Source: PwC, 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights, October 2021.

In an overly complex organisation, it’s easy for the left hand not to know what the right hand is doing — and the consequences for cybersecurity and privacy can be dire. Seventy-five percent of C-suite respondents to our survey, including CISOs, say their companies are too complex, avoidably and unnecessarily so, and nearly as many say complexity poses “concerning” cyber and privacy risks to their organisations in 11 key areas.

Data seems to be a chief point of concern, especially among large companies (revenues of $1 billion or more). Data governance (77%) and the data infrastructure (77%) ranked highest among areas of “unnecessary and avoidable” complexity. Technology networks and devices are also highly complex, particularly in large companies and North American companies. Digital-native companies — those that exist entirely online — tend to use the newest technologies, which are designed to connect and operate together. Most other companies’ technology architectures, which include legacy systems, are more complicated. Mergers with other entities may multiply risks by connecting already complex networks and systems.

The most worried about all this complexity are CEOs. They assign a complexity level of 10 to seven of 11 areas in their organisations. CEOs tend to be more concerned about cyber and privacy risks arising from complexities in the cloud environment, governance of tech investments, and crossover from IT to operational technology (OT). Executives in large organisations and in North America are more likely to be concerned about risks from complexities in the cloud environment and the crossover from IT to OT.

Source: PwC, 2022 Global Digital Trust Insights, October 2021.

Complexity isn’t bad in and of itself. Often, it’s a by-product of business growth. The larger an organisation, the more complex it will naturally be, needing more people and technologies to serve a growing customer base.

The costs of creating unnecessary complexity are not obvious, and it’s hard to create urgency around combatting complexity — that is, until an attack occurs.

One company needlessly kept the sensitive data of people it no longer did business with, making that data available for hackers to steal.

In our article Simplifying cyber, we give examples of how simplification can improve security. At a global retail organisation, six vendors managed customer contacts. Two of those vendors’ systems had been breached in the past. After consulting with the CEO and board, the new operations director whittled the vendor list to two. This simplification improved security: Monitoring two vendors is easier than keeping tabs on six, making information access easier to control, and the retailer could more readily back up the smaller cache of customer data.

Asked to name the top consequences of operational complexity, our respondents named:

1.  Financial losses due to successful data breaches or cyber attacks.
2.  Inability to innovate as quickly as the market opportunities allow.
3.  Lack of operational resilience, or the ability to recover from a cyber attack or technology failure.

Complexity not only threatens today’s fortunes, in the view of executives. It also prevents organisations from creating new opportunities quickly and pursuing future ones.

## The move to simplification

Simplification in organisations: 3 in 10 have streamlined over the last two years

Businesses know the risks of complexity, yet only 35% of our respondents have performed any streamlining of their operations and a quarter say they’ve done nothing at all or are just getting started. But a shift appears to be underway.

Simplifying an organisation takes time, requiring changes in viewpoints and company culture. That’s not easy to achieve, but the payoffs are mighty. The companies that had the best cybersecurity outcomes over the past two years (most improved) are 5x more likely to have streamlined operations enterprise-wide. They’ve focused on consolidating tech vendors (62%), defining/realigning the mix of in-house and managed services (60%), reorganising functions and ways of working (59%) and creating an integrated data governance framework (58%).

More and more CISOs and CIOs are taking a hard look at their tech investments, no longer just entertaining or chasing the latest products from tech vendors. We’re seeing consolidation of tech vendors and applications to reverse the hard-to-manage and risky tangle of disparate and vulnerable software and tech stack.
