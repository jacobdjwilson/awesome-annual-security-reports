CYBERSECURITY 
CULTURE REPORT
The State of Small 
and Medium-Sized 
Critical Infrastructure 
Enterprises
This report compiles the findings of a survey administered to small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 

## Executive Summary
A
s we see an increasing number 
of cybersecurity threats to 
critical infrastructure around 
the world, staying vigilant to 
prevent attacks is a key priority 
for enterprises, both large and small. Data[^1] 
show that smaller enterprises will soon be 
just as likely to experience a cyberattack as 
larger enterprises. Thus, cybersecurity culture 
is a mission-critical component of modern 
organizational culture. It is grounded in the 
beliefs and attitudes employees at all levels 
possess toward the cybersecurity practices 
of their enterprise, and it manifests in the 
ownership they take in doing their part to 
remain vigilant in defense of their enterprise. 
Cybersecurity culture is believed to be an 
accurate predictor of an enterprise’s ability 
to prepare for and respond with confidence 
to a cyberattack. To take a closer look, 
USTelecom surveyed more than 300 small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engaged 
in critical infrastructure work to gauge their 
cybersecurity culture and which factors—from 
IT budgets to specific company practices—
have the strongest correlation to mature 
cybersecurity culture.

## Key Findings
Culture Varies Widely By Sector And Company Size 
Cybersecurity culture and practices 
vary widely by infrastructure sector. 
The IT and Communications (Comms) 
sectors stood out as having the strongest 
cybersecurity cultures, with the Comms 
sector scoring most consistently high 
across the five dimensions.
The IT, Comms, and Financial Services 
sectors were the most likely to perform 
important cybersecurity culture practices 
including performance appraisals, rewards 
for proactive behavior, training initiatives, 
and routine communications with internal 
stakeholders.
Cybersecurity culture and practices 
vary widely with company size. More 
than 9 out of 10 companies with 501-1,000 
employees agreed their companies were 
improving  cybersecurity culture, different 
departments could work together, and 
employees speak their mind to help 
improve cybersecurity. Less than 2 out of 
3 companies with 1-50 employees agreed 
with these statements with regard to their 
own ventures.
Companies with 501-1,000 employees 
were also more likely to utilize several 
cybersecurity culture practices, including 
performance appraisals, rewards for 
proactive behavior, learning and training 
initiatives, and routine communications 
with internal stakeholders. 

Revenue Doesn’t Predict Culture But Culture Predicts Preparedness
Annual revenue is not a reliable 
predictor of cybersecurity culture. An 
enterprise’s cybersecurity culture is not 
contingent on its annual revenue. In fact, 
enterprises with between $1 million and 
$5 million in annual revenue had nearly 
as many Mature cybersecurity cultures as 
enterprises with top annual revenues of 
more than $50 million. This is an important 
finding that suggests smaller revenue 
streams do not necessarily hinder small 
and medium-sized enterprises from 
achieving a strong cybersecurity culture.
Cybersecurity culture is a reliable 
predictor of confidence and 
preparedness. The data and 
supplemental analyses indicate that 
cybersecurity culture is a driving force 
in defending against cyberattacks. As 
strength and maturity of cybersecurity 
culture increases, so does preparedness. 
Of note, the frequency of cybersecurity-
related communication is significantly 
higher among respondents with a 
Mature cybersecurity culture. This insight 
reinforces the notion that increased 
communication related to cybersecurity 
will foster confidence, transparency and 
truth telling, which leads to a stronger 
and more mature cybersecurity culture. 
Higher confidence directly translates to 
employees knowing what to do when 
faced with a cyberattack and departments 
being capable of working together.

IT Budgets Do Not Predict Culture But Multi-Faceted Approaches Do
Size of cybersecurity and IT budgets do 
not significantly impact cybersecurity 
culture. The size of an enterprise’s 
cybersecurity and IT budget on its own 
does not have a significant impact 
on cybersecurity culture. Additionally, 
enterprises in the Growing cybersecurity 
culture segment often spend more on 
cybersecurity, but these increases—largely 
focused on capacity building, dissipate 
as the enterprise graduates into a Mature 
cybersecurity culture.   
More complex, multi-faceted budgets 
drive cybersecurity culture. Companies 
with Mature cybersecurity cultures 
consider a greater number of factors for 
their cybersecurity spending. Protecting 
customer data, business continuity, 
preventing fraud/theft, and protecting 
staff are the factors that most strongly 
influenced cybersecurity spending within 
organizations with a Mature cybersecurity 
culture. 

## Methodology and Analytical Framework
S
ome 374 respondents 
from small and medium-
sized enterprises assessed 
27 statements exploring five 
dimensions of their organization’s 
cybersecurity culture: employee, 
management, organization, 
company and training. See 
Appendix A for full survey. 
Researchers used the responses 
to create average scores for 
each dimension and an overall 
composite score. Segmentation 
analysis then produced a 
cybersecurity culture index divided 
into four segments: Mature, 
Growing, Emerging and Weak. See 
Appendix B for details.

C
ybersecurity culture refers to the 
attitudes and beliefs of people within 
an enterprise regarding cybersecurity 
and how these attitudes and beliefs manifest 
themselves in the behavior of employees. 
Cybersecurity culture is an important 
component of an enterprise’s organizational 
culture, as it creates a sense of accountability 
in employees at all levels to ensure their 
enterprise is secure.
As small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
continue to experience increasing numbers of 
cyber incidents and breaches, it is crucial that 
these enterprises develop and strengthen their 
cybersecurity culture. Employing adaptable 
and repeatable cybersecurity practices 
and procedures like training and education 
initiatives, frequent cybersecurity related 
communications, and rewards for proactive 
behavior, are just a few of the many practices 
that have shown success in creating a stronger 
cybersecurity culture. 
Cybersecurity culture is also believed to 
directly affect the confidence employees 
have when defending against a cyberattack 
and the overall preparedness of an enterprise. 
The 2021 Verizon Breach report[^2]  found 
that 82% of breaches involved the Human 
Element, including social attacks, errors and 
misuse. With cybersecurity culture playing a 
significant role in strengthening the human 
layer of security in an enterprise, building and 
strengthening cybersecurity culture has the 
potential to be the most critical success factor 
for small and medium-sized enterprises.

## SECTION 1: Cybersecurity Culture by Critical Infrastructure Sector
I
n the first section of our findings, we look at how the critical 
infrastructure sector an organization belongs to can affect 
cybersecurity culture and practices. Respondents were 
asked to provide the critical infrastructure that best described 
the company where they worked.  
The three largest infrastructure sectors within the sample 
are communications (Comms/Telecom) (17%), information 
technology (IT) (13%), and financial services (13%).
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN 
CYBERSECURITY CULTURE AND PRACTICES BASED 
ON INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR.
Within the survey, respondents provided their level of 
agreement (strongly agree—strongly disagree) with 
statements pertaining to the five cybersecurity culture 
dimensions: employee, management, organization, company, 
and training. Leveraging survey responses, average scores 
were created for each of the dimensions of culture within each 
critical infrastructure sector. Scores on each dimension range 
from 1 (Weak) to 5 (Strong).
The data is clear; there are significant differences in 
cybersecurity culture based on infrastructure sector at an 
overall level, composite scores across culture dimensions, 
and within each dimension of culture. Figure 1 shows the 
composite score of each sector after averaging the dimension 
scores together. There are significant differences within 
sectors across dimensions of cybersecurity culture and that 
culture wanes significantly through different infrastructure 
sectors.
The Comms and IT sectors emerged as having the 
strongest cybersecurity cultures across each dimension of 
cybersecurity culture. The Comms sector is most consistent 
across the cybersecurity culture dimensions.   
The data also provided detailed perspectives on nuances in 
cybersecurity by infrastructure sector, namely the Comms, IT, 
and Financial Services sectors.

- Different departments communicate openly about 
cybersecurity (80%), and
- Different departments are capable of working together to 
ensure cybersecurity (80%).

## SECTION 2: Cybersecurity Culture by Organizational Size
I
n this section, we look at the respondents 
according to their company size to gain 
insights on how the number of employees 
can affect cybersecurity culture and 
practices. Respondents fell into one of four 
groups, enterprises with 1-50, 51-100, 101-
500, or 501-1000 employees. Respondents 
were asked to respond to statements about 
their enterprise using a Likert scale (strongly 
agree, agree, neutral/unsure, disagree, 
strongly disagree). Significant differences 
in cybersecurity culture and practices were 
shown when comparing enterprises based 
on organizational size. The results are shown 
in Figure 2.
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT 
DIFFERENCES IN CYBERSECURITY 
CULTURE AND PRACTICES BASED ON 
ORGANIZATIONAL SIZE.
For example, more than 90% of 
respondents with 501-1000 employees 
agreed (both strongly agree and agree) 
with the following statements:
- Employees in my organization speak their 
mind to help improve our cybersecurity 
(100%),
- My company is improving our culture on 
matters of cybersecurity (93%), and
- Different departments within my 
organization are capable of working 
together to ensure cybersecurity (93%).
Respondents with less than 100 employees 
agreed to a lesser degree with the 
statements above. Nonetheless, a significant 
majority of respondents across all sizes 
agreed with the questions asked.
For example, enterprises with less than 100 
employees agreed (both strongly agree and 
agree) with the following statements. 
- Employees in my organization believe their 
actions are important contributions to the 
organization’s cybersecurity (83%),
- Employees in my organization help 
other employees comply with matters of 
cybersecurity (81%), and
- Employees in my organization know why 
cybersecurity is important to our business 
(80%).
When asked about specific cybersecurity 
practices, companies with more employees 
are more likely to formally assess 
compliance in performance appraisals, 
communicate with internal stakeholders, 
reward employees for proactive behaviors, 
and utilize training to build cybersecurity 
culture. The full breakdown by organizational 
size is shown in Figure 3. Respondents simply 
agreed or disagreed (answered yes or no) 
to whether their enterprise performs these 
practices. These practices contribute to a 
stronger cybersecurity culture, which drives a 
higher level of preparedness.

## SECTION 3: Segmentation Analysis of Cybersecurity Culture
I
n this section, we discuss the findings gathered following the 
segmentation analysis of cybersecurity culture. Based on the answers 
provided by respondents when asked a series of questions for each of 
the cybersecurity culture dimension, composite-scores were created for 
each dimension that could range from 1 (Weak) to 5 (Strong). 
From these responses, the researchers identified the four unique 
categories of Mature, Growing, Emerging, and Weak cybersecurity 
culture. Figure 4 provides the size of each segment within our sample.
In Figure 4, we can see that enterprises in the Mature, Growing, and 
Emerging cybersecurity culture segments made up about 70% of 
the data. This means that most of the enterprises we surveyed are 
taking steps to strengthen their cybersecurity culture. Strengthening 
cybersecurity culture requires identifying an enterprise’s limitations and 
barriers and then taking the necessary steps to overcome identified 
obstacles.
CULTURE IS CONFIDENCE IN CYBERSECURITY.
Confidence defending against cyberattacks increases significantly 
and proportionately with cybersecurity culture. Confidence is an 
important indicator of how an organization will fare when faced with 
a cyberattack. The more confident employees and management are, 
the more likely they will be able to adequately prepare for and respond 
to a cyberattack. 
As shown in Figure 5, there was a dramatic increase in the average 
confidence level between Weak cybersecurity cultured and Emerging 
cybersecurity cultured enterprises. As cybersecurity culture levels 
continue to increase, so do employee levels of confidence. This finding 
suggests that organizations can see a significant growth in employee 
confidence as soon as they reach an Emerging level of cybersecurity 
culture. 
Based off the questions asked in this survey, confidence translates 
directly to employees knowing what to do to ensure their enterprise’s 
cybersecurity, and departments being capable of working together to 
ensure cybersecurity.

REVENUE ALONE DOES NOT ENSURE A STRONG 
CYBERSECURITY CULTURE.
Our segmentation analysis shows that the emergence of Mature 
cybersecurity culture is not contingent on annual enterprise revenue. 
Smaller organizations may not need to significantly grow their revenues 
to reach a Mature cybersecurity culture. As seen in Figure 6, while 45% 
of organizations that fall in the Mature cybersecurity culture segment 
have annual revenues exceeding $50 million, the second largest group 
within this segment are companies with annual revenues between 
$1 to $5 million at 40%. This finding suggests that revenue size of 
an organization does not hinder its ability to establish a strong 
cybersecurity culture.
SIZE OF ANNUAL CYBERSECURITY AND IT BUDGETS DO NOT 
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT CYBERSECURITY CULTURE.
Organizations with weaker cybersecurity cultures direct less of 
their overall budget to IT and cybersecurity. Those in the Growing 
cybersecurity culture segment spend significantly more on maintaining 
cybersecurity, compared to other segments. However, as seen in 
Figure 7, this seems to be a temporary increase as budget allocations 
drop by about $400,000 as companies graduate from Growing to 
Mature cybersecurity cultures. The increase in budget between the 
Emerging and Growing cybersecurity culture segments could be 
attributed to necessary investments for capacity building.

_Bold Text – Denotes Statistical Significance_

STRONG CYBERSECURITY CULTURE MEANS MORE 
COMPLEX, MULTI-FACETED BUDGETS.
The final key finding relating to the budgets of cybersecurity 
culture in the four segments of our analysis are the number 
of factors that influence an enterprise’s cybersecurity 
spending. Respondents from organizations in the Mature 
cybersecurity culture segment are significantly more likely 
to indicate that more factors influence their cybersecurity 
spending. 
Notice in Figure 8 the degree to which the factors that 
influence cybersecurity spending decreases demonstrably 
through the lower levels of cybersecurity culture. On average, 
only 17% of respondents within the Weak cybersecurity 
culture segment strongly agreed that any of the below factors 
influenced their cybersecurity culture spending.
Given that these differences are statistically significant we 
can confidently conclude that these differences are driven by 
the groups included in the analysis. The trend of the Mature 
segment being statistically and significantly different from all 
other segments persisted across virtually all metrics within the 
survey. 

## Conclusion
T
he findings in this report demonstrate the importance 
of cybersecurity culture in small and medium-sized 
enterprises. After analyzing several variables, we were 
able to see which factors have the largest influence on the 
strength of an enterprise’s cybersecurity culture. Both the 
critical infrastructure sector an enterprise belongs to, as well as 
the organizational size of an enterprise, were shown to have a 
significant impact on the strength of a cybersecurity culture. 
A clear relationship between employee confidence and 
cybersecurity culture was also shown in our findings. Enterprises 
with a Mature cybersecurity culture benefit from a higher level of 
confidence among their employees. Higher confidence directly 
translates to employees knowing what to do when faced with a 
cyberattack and departments being capable of working together. 
The size of an enterprise’s cybersecurity and IT budget did not 
have a significant impact on cybersecurity culture, though 
enterprises with Mature cybersecurity cultures did indicate that 
they considered a greater number of spending factors than 
weaker enterprises. Top cybersecurity spending factors included 
protecting customer data, maintaining business continuity, 
preventing fraud or theft, and protecting staff. 
It was also clear that strength of cybersecurity culture did not rely 
on an organization’s annual revenue. In fact, enterprises within the 
second smallest revenue category had nearly as many enterprises 
in the Mature cybersecurity segment as enterprises with top 
annual revenues of more than $50 million. This finding challenges 
the long-held belief that enterprises need significant revenue 
streams to achieve a robust cybersecurity architecture.
From our survey and analysis, we can say with confidence that 
cybersecurity culture within small and medium-sized enterprises 
is an important factor in the growth and maintenance of a robust 
cybersecurity posture, especially in the face of growing cyber 
threats. Enterprises can best achieve a Mature cybersecurity 
culture by promoting cybersecurity practices like education and 
training initiatives and increasing the frequency of cybersecurity 
communications across all levels of their enterprise. Executive 
level engagement is a critical success factor as employees take 
their cues from the top.

## Appendix B
MATURE
The mature cybersecurity culture segment made up 28% of the sample. Mature is an 
appropriate term to describe the cybersecurity culture within this segment as the data 
indicated an established strength across each dimension of cybersecurity culture. 
Respondents fitting within this segment scored significantly higher on each dimension 
of cybersecurity culture compared to other segments. Respondents within the mature 
cybersecurity culture perceived the culture as being strong on each of these dimensions. 
GROWING
The growing cybersecurity culture segment made up 15% of the sample. Growing is a 
fitting term for this segment as the data indicates there is strength across most dimensions 
of cybersecurity culture. Specifically, there is strength in the culture at the company, 
management, and department levels as well as in preparedness. There is a slight lag in the 
scores pertaining to employees and the training pertaining to cybersecurity culture.
EMERGING
The emerging cybersecurity culture segment made up of 27% of the sample. Emerging 
appropriately describes this segment as there is strength emerging within specific 
dimensions; however, there are also limitations or barriers preventing cybersecurity culture 
from growing and maturing within this segment.
WEAK
Finally, the weak cybersecurity culture segment made up 31% of the sample, the largest of 
the four segments. The term weak is a fitting description as scores across each dimension 
are significantly lower than all other segments and there is a wider range in scores across 
the cybersecurity culture dimensions suggesting there is a great deal of work to be done for 
organizations to shift from the weak to emerging segment.
Figure 9 at right outlines the 
composite-scores of each 
dimension for each of the four 
unique culture segments in 
our analysis.
