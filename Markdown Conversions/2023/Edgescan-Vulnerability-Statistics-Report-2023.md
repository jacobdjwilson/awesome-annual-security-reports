## Introduction
Welcome to the 8th edition of the Edgescan Vulnerability Stats Report 2023. This report demonstrates the state of full stack security based on thousands of security assessments and penetration tests on millions of assets that were performed globally from the Edgescan Cybersecurity Platform in 2022. 
This is an analysis of vulnerabilities detected in the systems of hundreds of organizations across a wide range of industries – from the Fortune 500 to medium and small businesses. The report provides a statistical model of the most common weaknesses faced by organisations to enable data-driven decisions for managing risks and exposures more effectively. 
We hope this report will provide a unique by-the-numbers insight into trends, statistics, and snapshot of the overall state of cybersecurity for the past year, from the perspective of vulnerabilities discovered and remediated, as well as penetration testing success rates. 
We’re proud that this yearly report has become a reliable source for approximating the global state of vulnerability management. This is exemplified by our unique dataset being part of the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), which is the de facto standard for insights into the common drivers for incidents and breaches today. 
This year we delve into Risk Density to describe where critical severity vulnerabilities and exposures are clustered in the IT technical stack, quantification of attack surface management exposures and risks, and Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR) critical vulnerabilities. 
We split our statistical models across layers of the technology stack (Full Stack) such as Web Application, API, and Device/Host layers. Additionally, we make a distinction in the data for four tiers of business sizes based on employee count and a distinction between internet facing and internally facing assets. 
We take a look at how quickly various vulnerabilities are being fixed based on risk. Unfortunately, we still see high rates of known (patchable) exploitable vulnerabilities, with working exploits in the wild being used by nation states and cyber criminal groups against organizations who are slow to patch. 
New in this report is the way we look at prioritization and risk scores. Since Edgescan employs a number of risk prioritization scoring mechanisms, we take a deeper look at the most common risks faced by organisations and also look at correlation of the various risk scoring methodologies. Some of the results are surprising and we hope you will stay to the end to learn more! 
Given Edgescan maps validated vulnerabilities automatically to ₁CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), ₂CISA KEV (Cyber Security & Infrastructure Security Agency Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalogue), ₃EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) and our own EVSS (Edgescan Validated Security Score), we have leveraged this information to provide a qualitatively better guide to what the most common risks faced by systems deployed in modern enterprises are.

## 2022 Year in Review
When we examine cyber posture from an attack surface standpoint, exposed services are a real risk. Statistically some vulnerabilities have a very low frequency of occurrence compared to the total number of vulnerabilities discovered, but many will result in a breach with an outsized impact, which we can call an intensive rather than extensive risk. 
Similarly to the 2022 report, patching and maintenance is a challenge and we still find that it is not trivial to patch production systems. The MTTR (Mean Time to Remediation) stats also reflect on this issue. Continuous detection and assessment needs improvement and as I’ve always said, visibility is paramount. 
Internal, non-public cyber security posture is significantly lacking in terms of resilience and ease of exploit. Combining vulnerabilities across the stack, in some cases, results in the potential impact being much more severe than the sum of the individual discovered vulnerabilities. 
Oddly, CVE’s dating from 2015 are still being discovered and are being used by ransomware and malware toolkits to exploit systems when they can find them. 
Attack Surface Management (Visibility) is a key driver to cybersecurity best practices and based on our continuous asset profiling, we discuss how common sensitive and critical systems are exposed to the public Internet far more than they should be. The assumption here is that enterprises simply do not have systems, people and processes in place, to make them aware of exposures in a manner that facilitates remediation actions. 
This report provides a global snapshot across dozens of industry verticals and how to prioritize what is important, as not all vulnerabilities are created equal.

## Report Synopsys
Non-internet facing systems have a significant risk density 
- Our data indicates internal systems are less hardened than Internet facing systems (which is no surprise) and many feature prominently exploitable applications like Mozilla Firefox and Adobe with multiple CVE’s that are listed on the CISA KEV. For example, The Adobe vulnerabilities commonly found are listed on the CISA KEV and have an EPSS score of 86%. 
- This “target rich environment” allows threat actors to easily pivot within a local network post initial-access (breach) at the perimeter. 
- So called, “Shift-Left” security is not taking into account the live environment on which systems are deployed, resulting in undetected weaknesses in the overall network of systems. Systems being assessed in a “lab” environment are not reflective of the risks when deployed on the public Internet. 

Mean Time To Remediation (MTTR) for Critical Severity vulnerabilities is 65 days (across the full stack). And while this result is similar to previous years, industry reports estimate that adversaries are now able to exploit a vulnerability within 15 days (on average) of discovery[^1]. One third of all vulnerabilities across the full stack discovered in 2022 were either High or Critical Severity. 
- While credential theft and stuffing is the most common mechanism for exploitation and phishing is second, exploiting vulnerabilities is the third most common vector to breach an organisation (according to the Verizon DBIR). CISA recommends fixing critical severity vulnerabilities within 15 days and high severity vulnerabilities within 30 days. Both secure development and continuous monitoring needs improvement, given that many of the high and critical severity issues seen in live environments are trivial to remediate. 

The most common application layer vulnerabilities are still Injection related, this also applies to API’s. 
- We are still seeing vulnerabilities which are not particularly new or exotic, but are widespread and very effective in terms of successful breach. Many injection related vulnerabilities can be easily detected using automation if applied on a frequent basis and importantly, if assessment coverage can be assured. 

CISA KEV & EPSS combined are very useful in moving towards Risk Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM). 
- Our report notes instances when EPSS and CISA KEV do not align. CVSS score alone does not provide adequate metadata to help make risk based decisions. A combination of CVSS, EPSS, CISA KEV, and security validation is required to deliver risk based prioritization[^2]. 
Prioritization needs to take into account the criticality of the asset. 
- Given limited resources, proper prioritization is key to success as noted in the report. Additionally asset criticality must be a factor in the prioritization calculus. Understanding which assets are business critical and combining that information with vulnerability scoring information, is an indicated path to achieving true Risk Based Vulnerability Management. 

Convergence of Vulnerability Management and Penetration Testing output is highly effective. 
- Cybersecurity is perhaps more of a qualitative than quantitative effort. When identifying vulnerabilities in systems it is necessary to prioritize risks. However, prioritization alone is not sufficient, as we see when we layer in exploitability metrics with EPSS and EVSS, or when we also take into account asset value. Another level of validation needs to occur (like quality assurance of software releases) and that is essentially what penetration testing provides. Penetration testing is the qualitative proof, for security controls or exploitable vulnerabilities that should be remediated immediately. 
- Combining intelligence harvested from both manual penetration testing (for depth) and vulnerability scanning (for frequency) – different means to the same end – can significantly help with prioritization and identification of risks. 

Oddly, many “PCI Fails” are essentially “false flags” not listed on the CISA KEV or having a high EPSS probability score. 
- A PCI compliance failure may occur because a CVE has a CVSS score above 4.0, without having any known exploits in the wild or impact on real world security via penetration test validation. 
- This leads us to conclude that Compliance and Security are certainly not the same. And unfortunately, compliance may be creating more harm than good by distracting from the real work of RBVM.

## Risk Density
The following is a breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity, discovered across the full stack; Web Applications, API’s and Network/Host deployments.
It also depicts the risks associated with potential PCI (Payment Card Industry) Failures – Not every vulnerability results in a PCI fail.
Severity is defined via the Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS). Later in the report we draw upon CVSS, CISA KEV and EPSS Risk and Probability scores.

Across the full stack more than 33% of discovered vulnerabilities were of a critical or high severity.

![Full stack vulnerability severity distribution]

Across the Web application and API layers 12% of discovered vulnerabilities were of a critical or high severity.

35.5% of discovered vulnerabilities in the infrastructure/hosting/cloud/network layer were of a critical or high severity.

54% of PCI failures were of medium Severity.
Research indicates that such vulnerabilities will never be exploited, albeit they result in a PCI DSS compliance fail.

## Web Applications - Critical Severity Vulnerabilities
The Application Security Critical severity Top 10 depicts the most common critical risk issues discovered by Edgescan over the past year. SQL Injection is still the main contender (as was in the 2022 report), which is interesting to note as we can easily develop code (or block vectors) to mitigate such attacks. Detection of such vulnerabilities is also trivial using the correct techniques.
Something which is overlooked quite frequently is “malicious file upload” at 22.7% of all critical vulnerabilities discovered. This can give rise to ransomware, malware and internal network breach pivot points for attackers.
Log4Shell (First discovered in late 2022) contributed to 5% of all critical severity vulnerabilities discovered this year. Authorization issues cover privilege escalation or access to restricted functionality which would result in a data breach.

SQL injection vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is incorporated into database SQL queries in an unsafe manner. An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.  Various attacks can be delivered via SQL injection, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with application logic, escalating privileges within the database and executing operating system commands.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Apache Log4j < 2.15.0 due to insufficient protections on message lookup substitutions when dealing with user controlled input. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this, via a web request to execute arbitrary code with the permission level of the running Java process.

This is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via data binding.

Uploaded viruses and malware could later be downloaded by users of the application. Such malware can cause partial or complete compromise of a network that the host resides on.

Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-II XSS.

Poor password controls such as no MFA, Default Credentials etc.

Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the users limits.

The Database console was accessible, and provides access to privileged functionality which should not be accessible, except by authorized users or networks. Access to the console could allow a malicious actor to execute SQL statements on the sever.

Multiple vulnerabilities pertaining to PHP patching.

This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

Password based attacks could also be used and if successful aid an attacker in compromising this host.

SSRF is an attack that abuses an application to interact with a privileged network or the server itself.

CORS, when misconfigured, can enable an attacker to bypass it and make the client browser act as a proxy between a malicious website and the target web application.

Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect to an arbitrary location.

When a failed log-in attempt is made, enumeration of the username can occur if the server returns a non-generic response.

The application exposed unnecessary sensitive information. Types of information considered sensitive include: internal IP addresses, physical paths on the host, detailed platform information, domain information, etc.

Similar to SQL Injection, XPath Injection attacks occur when a website uses user-supplied information to construct an XPath query for XML data.

Insufficient session expiration by the web application increases the exposure to other session-based attacks.

Without proper validation of the host header, an application is vulnerable to a number of types of attack.

The version of the Wordpress deployed is known to be vulnerable.

## API - Critical and High Severity Vulnerabilities
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. API’s have become very popular but cyber security approaches to API’s have been lacking. Using a custom security tool built for API assessments is of key importance, as there are many differences between API’s and Web Applications.

Most Common High and Critical severity vulnerabilities discovered

## Vulnerability Severity - EPSS, CISA KEV, and EVSS
What is EPSS?
The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is an open, data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. The EPSS model produces a probability score between 0 and 1 (0 and 100%). The higher the score, the greater the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited. 
https://www.first.org/epss/

What is CISA KEV?
CISA maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild: the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog. 
CISA strongly recommends all organizations review and monitor the KEV catalog and prioritize remediation of the listed vulnerabilities to reduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.
https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities

Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS)
Every vulnerability discovered by Edgescan is validated via a combination of data analytics and human expertise, resulting in near false positive-free vulnerability intelligence. Once a vulnerability is validated is it mapped to both the CISA KEV and EPSS to assist with prioritization. All vulnerabilities in Edgescan (where applicable) have a EPSS, CISA KEV, CVSS and EVSS risk score.

## Internet Facing Vulnerabilities - Critical Severity
Looking at vulnerabilities from a full stack perspective, we list the most common critical severity vulnerabilities found on internet-facing systems. The % column on the far left is the percentage of all critical severity vulnerabilities discovered. The CVSS score are undoubtedly high but not all vulnerabilities are listed on the CISA KEV or have a high probability via EPSS.
Note which are listed on the CISA KEV and the corresponding EPSS Score – In some cases the EPSS depicts a low probability of exploitation but it being on the CISA KEV means it is/has been exploited.

The mapping between CVSS, CISA KEV and EPSS is important to note. CISA KEV and EPSS do not appear to be aligned 100% of the time. High CVSS scores do not necessarily mean remediation is considered high priority. Some CISA KEV vulnerabilities have a low EPSS score. Conclusion: we need multiple viewpoints to determine priority.
