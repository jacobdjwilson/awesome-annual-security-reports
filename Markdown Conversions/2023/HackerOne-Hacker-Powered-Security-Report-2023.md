Its Riskier Not to Work 
With Hackers
Cybercrime continues to rise at the 
same time CISOs are being 
challenged to do more with less. 
Research from early 20231 revealed 
that one\-third of companies had 
made security budget cuts in the 
past 12 months and that a quarter 
were planning to make cuts in the 
following 12 months, with 40% saying 
they were planning to make 
headcount cuts in the same 
timeframe. Of the security 
professionals surveyed, 67% said 
they believed reducing budget and 
headcount in security would 
negatively affect their ability to 
handle cybersecurity incidents.
In this climate, youre more at risk if 
youre ignoring the benefits a huge 
community of talented and 
tenacious ethical hackers can bring 
to your organizations security. 
Thousands of the worlds most 
influential brands trust hackers to 
deliver impactful findings and 
vulnerabilities.

Models (LLMs)
How to attract the top 
hackers to your program
While nondisclosure agreements 
(NDAs) remain a hot topic in the 
hacking community, only 9% of 
hackers say NDAs put them off 
hacking a target (down from 11% 
in 2022\) and only 14% are put off 
by the inability to publicly 
disclose vulnerabilities (down 
from 17% in 2022\), showing 
hackers adaptability and 
willingness to work within 
these constraints.
How your industry 
compares against the top 
ten vulnerability stats and 
why your program may 
return different results than 
the HackerOne platform 
averages
When we look at the high and 
critical vulnerabilities compared 
against all vulnerability reports, 
we see a higher ranking for 
insecure direct object references 
(IDOR), for example, because 
these are not vulnerabilities 
you can scan for. This highlights 
the importance of human 
intelligence in seeking out these 
weaknesses.
How you can save money 
by incorporating code 
security audits and 
pentesting into your bug 
bounty strategy
A code security audit could save 
you a potential $18,000 on your 
bounty program.
The latest bounty data and 
how your median and top 
bounties stack up against 
your peers
The median cost of a bug on the 
HackerOne platform is $500, the 
average cost is $1,048, and the 
90th percentile is $3,000\.

What Motivates Hackers to Find 
and Report Vulnerabilities
Only one\-quarter of hackers hack full\-time: nearly two\-thirds of hackers spend less than 20 hours a

The Diverse Skill Sets of 
the Hacking Community
2023 Hacker\-Powered Security Report

Hackers use a plethora of techniques; while 95% of hackers specialize in web 
application testing, they also span a range of new and emerging technologies. 
47% specialize in network application testing, 20% have experience with social 
engineering, and 63% do vulnerability research. 36% of hackers say they are 
most skilled at the reconnaissance part of hacking, and 20% say they are best 
at exploitation.
So many hackers specialize in web applications because 
the majority of internet interactions take place via web 
applications, meaning that hackers are already very 
familiar with their mechanisms. Moreover, the attack 
surface of web applications provides a particularly wide 
and rich testing ground, with organizations having huge 
sets of assets across the internet. I also specialize in social 
engineering. Its always fascinated me; instead of hacking 
technical systems, were trying to open a window into the 
human mindset. While it seems that our brain is immensely 
more complex than a computer, social engineering is the 
easiest way for a malicious actor to reach their target. 
Social engineering is more challenging to run as an ethical 
hacking exercise since the hacker needs to have an 
understanding of psychology and sociology, while also 
understanding the ethics behind any assessment.

What Hackers Can Tell You 
About Securing AI
The pressure to rapidly adopt generative artificial intelligence to boost 
productivity and remain competitive has ramped up to an incredible level. 
Concurrently, security leaders are trying to understand how to leverage GenAI 
technology while ensuring protection from inherent security issues and threats. 
This challenge includes staying ahead of adversaries who may discover and 
exploit malicious uses before organizations can address them. Ethical hackers 
have been experimenting with GenAI since 2022 and are already becoming 
the experts you need on your side.

in some way.
66% of hackers said that they do or will use GenAI to write better reports, 53% say they will 
use it to write code, and 33% say they will use it to reduce language barriers.
55% of hackers say that GenAI tools themselves will become a major target for them in 
the coming years, and 61% said they plan to use and develop hacking tools that employ 
GenAI to find more vulnerabilities. Another 62% of hackers said they plan to specialize in 
the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models.
When we asked hackers to rank their concerns about the risks GenAI poses, 28% were 
most concerned about criminal exploitation of the tool, 22% about disinformation, and 18% 
about an increase in insecure code.
While 38% of hackers say they think GenAI will reduce the number of vulnerabilities in 
code, 43% say it will lead to an increase in vulnerabilities. Find out more in our

blog post 
on the potential risks GenAI poses
There are now suddenly a whole host of attack vectors for AI\-
powered applications that werent possible before. At the simplest 
level, its about tricking the AI into doing or revealing something it 
shouldnt. For example, chatbots often have access to company 
documentation and frequently asked questions. You want the 
responses to be able to answer users questions intelligently but 
not completely siphon off internal documentation or leak data. 
Accidental exposure of internal documentation is a very possible 
attack scenario. One of the reasons for AI security issues is that 
these applications are new and developing really fast; they dont 
necessarily take security very seriously. Ive spent a lot of time this 
year looking for those security issues and reporting them to the 
development teams.
The big companies that are creating their own versions of AI tools 
are more likely to bake security in because they already have a 
culture that prioritizes security. Hackers are also more likely to be 
given alpha or beta access to these tools so they can see it first 
and reveal those vulnerabilities before it goes out the door. From 
the hacker side, were experimenting with using AI to write tools 
that will help us hack better, but the AI models are getting harder 
to convince to help with that. However, I think that to be able to 
compete with the malicious actors, we need access to the same 
tools and techniques.

The OWASP Top Ten Vulnerabilities for 
Large Language Models
OWASP has already published their top ten vulnerabilities for LLM applications. Check outfor more information about these vulnerabilities.
the HackerOne blog
2023 Hacker\-Powered Security Report
14
\# 1
Prompt injection
The most commonly discussed LLM vulnerability, in which an attacker manipulates the 
operation of a trusted LLM through crafted inputs, either directly or indirectly.
\# 2
Insecure output handling
Occurs when an LLM output is accepted without scrutiny, potentially exposing backend systems. 
This can, in some cases, lead to severe consequences like XSS, CSRF, SSRF, privilege escalation, 
or remote code execution.
\# 3
Training data poisoning
Refers to the manipulation of data or fine\-tuning of processes that introduce vulnerabilities, 
backdoors, or biases and could compromise the models security, effectiveness, or 
ethical behavior.
\# 4
Model denial of service
Happens when attackers trigger resource\-heavy operations on LLMs, leading to service 
degradation or high costs.
\# 5
Supply chain vulnerabilities
The supply chain in LLMs can be vulnerable, impacting the integrity of training data, machine 
learning (ML) models, and deployment platforms. Supply chain vulnerabilities in LLMs can lead 
to biased outcomes, security breaches, and even complete system failures.
\# 6
Sensitive information disclosure
Happens when LLMs inadvertently reveal confidential data, resulting in the exposure of 
proprietary algorithms, intellectual property, and private or personal information, leading to 
privacy violations and other security breaches.
\# 7
Insecure plugin design
The power and usefulness of LLMs can be extended with plugins. However, this does come with 
the risk of introducing more vulnerable attack surfaces through poor or insecure plugin design.
\# 8
Excessive agency
Typically caused by excessive functionality, permissions, andor autonomy. One or more of 
these factors enables damaging actions to be performed in response to unexpected or 
ambiguous outputs from an LLM.
\# 9
Overreliance
When systems or people depend on LLMs for decision\-making or content generation without 
sufficient oversight. Organizations and the individuals that comprise them can over\-rely on 
LLMs without the knowledge and validation mechanisms required to ensure information is 
accurate, vetted, and secure.
\# 10
Model theft
Where there is unauthorized access, copying, or exfiltration of proprietary LLM models. This can 
lead to economic loss, reputational damage, and unauthorized access to highly sensitive data.

How to Keep Hackers 
Motivated for the 
Best Results
Whether youre running a bug bounty, pentest, or code security audit 
program, you benefit by attracting the best hackers to participate. 
We asked hackers what makes for a program they want to hack on.
Bounties are the main attraction to a program, with 73% choosing a 
program because it pays generous bounties. However, other 
attractive factors include the anticipation that a lot of vulnerabilities 
will be available to find on a target (50% of hackers named this), and 
a varied scope (which attracts 46% of hackers). 17% of hackers will 
spend time on a program due to the relationship they have with the 
organizations security team.
When it comes to turning hackers off a program, its all about the 
experience; poor communication puts off 55% of hackers and slow 
response times put off 60%. Just 9% of hackers say NDAs 
disincentivize them to hack a target, and only 14% are put off by a 
prohibition on publicly disclosing vulnerabilities they find. Both of 
those numbers are down slightly from 2022\. These numbers illustrate 
the adaptability of hackersand the viability of ethical hackers as a 
solution even for organizations that may require these common 
legal and disclosure restraints.
2023 Hacker\-Powered Security Report

When Im looking at a new program, I will 
look at the metrics in terms of time to 
triage and bounty and to what degree the 
program is hitting those metrics. I would 
advise companies to have both a public 
and private program. The public program, 
will screen and interview researchers that 
can be moved into the private program 
where you can provide them with more 
access and resources. A private program 
allows you to have an elite group of 
hackers really digging in and finding 
those critical vulnerabilities. For example, 
some hackers specialize in 
reconnaissance and finding those corners 
of infrastructure that no one is thinking 
about and looking in the corners, then you 
have other hackers that have hundreds of 
servers scanning for vulnerabilities. 
Novelty and scale are important for 
delivering impactful reports.

The number of hackers who have not disclosed a vulnerability theyve found declined to 46%, down 
from 51% in 2022\. Of the hackers that have held back on a disclosure, 45% said it was because there 
was no channel through which to disclose. 13% cited threatening legal language on an 
organizations website as the reason they didnt disclose the vulnerability. There remains a critical 
need for organizations to establish clear, accessible, and well\-communicated vulnerability 
disclosure policies and mechanisms to ensure vulnerabilities are reported and addressed promptly.

Things get more interesting when we break down bounties by high and critical 
vulnerabilities. Crypto and blockchain organizations continue to pay the highest bounties, 
with the top award reaching $100,050 in this industry. Computer software and internet and 
online services are also offering highly competitive rewards for the most critical 
vulnerabilities. The more security\-mature industries can afford to be more generous with 
the top bounties, as they receive fewer high and critical vulnerabilities. 26% of vulnerabilities 
reported to internet and online services organizations are high and critical, and only 22% of 
those reported to crypto and blockchain are high or critical.

In fact, bug bounty is truly a last line of defense because it 
covers all of your assets in production.
Top programs use bug bounty as a compassa tool to 
help navigate an attack surface to find gaps in security 
testing coverage. Top\-tier security teams leverage 
bounty programs as a performance monitoring system 
for their internal security strategy and a safety net that 
automatically deploys when other security testing 
systems and processes fail.
Bugs that slip through to production can be used to 
identify and resolve underlying challenges in security 
programs. The output of a bug bounty program can help 
identify improvement opportunities in the SDLC to 
implement or bolster controls such as:
A well\-integrated bug bounty program pinpoints 
challenges across the full vulnerability management 
landscape, including remediation practices, SLAs, 
stakeholder relationships, and pentesting habits. By 
learning from the outputs, an organization can 
systematically tighten its security controls to the point 
where novel and elusive bugsthose that can only be 
identified by human expertisebecome a more 
frequently reported class of vulnerability.

experts, has performed over 30,000 code reviews. Each review takes a median 
of 88 minutes to complete and surfaces an average of 1\.2 vulnerabilities.
18% of security fixes are incomplete, making them one of the most essential 
types of code changes to audit.

Design flaws and logic errors
Code audits can uncover design flaws and logic 
errors that might not be immediately apparent 
during production testing.
Cryptographic vulnerabilities
Security vulnerabilities related to cryptography
such as weak encryption algorithms, improper 
key management, and insecure random 
number generationare more likely to be 
found during a code audit due to their code\-
centric nature.
Insecure coding practices
Input validation and output encoding issues, 
lack of proper error handling, inadequate 
access controls, and other insecure coding 
practices can lead to various attacks, including 
injection attacks, cross\-site scripting (XSS), and 
privilege escalation.
Application and Infrastructure\-
as\-Code misconfigurations
These might lead to security vulnerabilities 
such as incorrect and missing security settings, 
default configurations, or insecure cloud 
configurations.
Hidden backdoors and 
malicious code
These are sometimes intentionally or 
unintentionally inserted into the codebase, and 
are often difficult to detect through traditional 
production testing methods alone.
Insecure dependencies
Code audits that include software composition 
analysis (SCA) can easily uncover 
vulnerabilities in third\-party libraries and 
dependencies that the application might use.
Sensitive data leakage
Data such as hard\-coded credentials, API keys, 
or encryption keys are often stored insecurely 
within the code.
Unintended information disclosure
Sensitive informationsuch as debug 
information, comments, or metadata
might unintentionally leak details about the 
application's internals and infrastructure.

Ensure Compliance 
With Industry 
Standards via Pentest 
as a Service (PTaaS)
A penetration test (pentest) involves identifying and 
addressing vulnerabilities, similar to a bug bounty 
program, but a pentest often leans more toward ensuring 
an organization adheres to specific compliance and 
security standards. Pentests typically follow a structured 
methodology that encompasses a comprehensive, time\-
bound examination of the system, focusing on identifying 
vulnerabilities that adversaries could exploit.
One thing people dont consider, 
including companies that want to 
sell us pentesting, is the advantage 
of running everything through one 
platform. Having one platform for a 
very wide range of offensive security 
testing avoids the need to onboard 
lots of different vendors, platforms, 
and so on. This creates a significant 
time and cost saving.

Vulnerabilities such as insufficient session expiration or violation of secure 
design principles are more likely to be identified during a pentest. This is 
because pentests often aim to ensure compliance with security standards and 
help pass audits, focusing on revealing weaknesses stemming from a lack of 
secure development processes. Audits typically target weaknesses like issues 
with session expiration or secure design principle violations, making them 
more likely to be discovered during a pentest. However, since vulnerabilities 
like insufficient session expiration are not inherently exploitable because they 
require additional conditions to pose a real threat, they may not lead to payouts 
in a bug bounty program, where exploitable vulnerabilities are prioritized.
Weve seen a 54% increase in pentests since 2022, and a 16% increase in the 
number of vulnerabilities being surfaced by pentests, with 15% of vulnerabilities 
found being rated as high or critical severity. On average, 11 valid vulnerabilities 
are reported per pentest.

Incentivize Novel and 
Elusive Vulnerabilities 
With a Bug Bounty
Once you have conducted a thorough code security 
audit or pentest to identify and address a range of 
vulnerabilities, its crucial to continue this proactive 
security approach. A bug bounty program is a 
comprehensive and offensive strategy to further cover 
your bases. It incentivizes a broad spectrum of ethical 
hackers to apply their diverse skills and creativity in 
rooting out even the most novel and elusive 
vulnerabilities in your shipped productsensuring 
robust, multi\-layered security.
After launching a bug bounty, the median time to receive 
the first valid report is 20 days. Hackers are reporting 13% 
more critical bugs in 2023, and 15% more high\-severity 
bugs. Critical or high\-rated bugs make up 29% of valid 
bug bounty reports.
How Does Your Industry 
Measure Up?
Weve taken a look at the top ten vulnerabilities reported 
on the HackerOne platform across all HackerOne 
products and calculated what percentage of the total 
reports is attributable to each vulnerability type. And 
weve cross\-referenced that by industry so you can see 
how your industry compares to the platform average 
when it comes to types of vulnerability reports received.
Cross\-site scripting (XSS)the largest category overall
is broken out into its different subtypes, so improper 
access control is the number\-one vulnerability on the list, 
comprising 13% of all valid vulnerabilities reported through 
the HackerOne platform. Most industries are seeing fewer 
reports than average. We go into the reasons for that 
next, in the industry\-specific sections.

High and Critical 
Vulnerabilities
When we look at the high and critical vulnerabilities, we 
see a high ranking for insecure direct object references 
(IDOR), for example, because these are not vulnerabilities 
you can scan for. This highlights the importance of 
human intelligence in seeking out these weaknesses. 
Similarly, SQL injection appears more often in the high
critical category because these vulnerabilities by their 
nature will have a significant impact because they would 
give an attacker access to the backend of your systems.

Financial Services
Financial Services stand out as being particularly security\-mature because the industry requires 
stringent compliance with regulations, meaning easy\-to\-fix vulnerabilities are going to be 
identified and remediated before products go live.
Government
Government agencies are performing poorly when it comes to the low\-hanging fruit. This is likely 
due to these organizations relying on older systems that get overlooked for reasons of budget, 
breadth, and forgotten assets. Government agencies are seeing fewer reports for more complex 
vulnerabilities like business logic errors because hackers exhaust the plentiful low\-hanging fruit 
before delving deeper.
Telecoms
Telecoms also rely on legacy systems, which are hard to make changes to. When those systems 
were implemented, there was less of a focus on security, so a lot of vulnerabilities would have 
been introducedmeaning high volumes of improper authentication and misconfigurations. 
Implementing authentication mechanisms on older systems is challenging and there is an 
incredibly large telecom user base to authenticate. It may be, therefore, that telecom companies 
want access control to be a point of focus and are incentivizing hackers to find these vulnerabilities.
Retail and E\-commerce
Retail and e\-commerce businesses, on the other hand, are typically using newer systems and 
are constantly refreshing. We see fewer improper access control vulnerabilities because there is 
less nuance in their authentication mechanisms: a straightforward log\-in to an account. 
Information disclosure and cross\-site scripting are in higher volumes, and the overall numbers 
for vulnerabilities are fairly high because there are a lot of parallels between e\-commerce sites, 
so testing for one will be very similar to testing for the nextmeaning its easy to replicate testing 
methods across hundreds of sites.
Automotive
Its not surprising that the automotive industry receives the greatest quantity of cross\-site scripting 
vulnerabilities. Historically, websites havent been their main focus when it comes to security 
software and they likely have a lot of third\-party and franchise websites that have these 
vulnerabilities within them. The volume of high percentages in the highcritical category is because 
the automotive industry is relatively new to bug bounty programs, so theres more clean\-up to do.
Media and Entertainment
The media and entertainment industry aligns closely with the average. While these organizations 
will have a lot of websites (including those largely forgotten for old releases), because they are 
often static pages, they are not hugely exploitable.
Computer Software
Because the computer software industrys products are largely delivered by desktop 
applications, fewer web vulnerabilities like cross\-site scripting affect these businesses.
Internet and Online Services
We see a high level of security maturity in the internet and online services industry because 
security has always been a key focus for them. This industry sees a particularly high percentage 
of high and critical cross\-site scripting (stored) vulnerabilities. This is because those 
vulnerabilities will have a particularly significant impact on this industry, allowing an attacker to 
deface websites and degrade customer trust, meaning that Internet and Online Services 
organizations incentivize hackers to report cross\-site scripting vulnerabilities.
Crypto and Blockchain
The results for crypto and blockchain diverge most significantly from the average. This is in part 
because this young industry has no reliance on legacy software and their developers have 
strong insight into security. Crypto and blockchain companies are more likely to incentivize 
hackers to find vulnerabilities that could result in the stealing or draining of cryptocurrency 
wallets, which is why were seeing a higher portion of reports for misconfiguration and business 
logic errors.
Travel and Tourism
The higher\-than\-average volume of cross\-site scripting reports for travel and tourism 
businesses is attributable to their huge attack surfaces. Frequent mergers and acquisitions in 
this industry add to an existing attack surface, and its not uncommon for each hotel property to 
have its own web presence. Findings for information disclosure and IDOR are also higher because 
this industry has a strong customer loyalty focus, so ensuring customer data is secure is a 
particular priority.
Fixing Bugs and 
Measuring 
Success
This year weve seen a significant 28% improvement in 
the time it takes to remediate a vulnerability once 
reportedfrom an average of 35\.5 days down to 25\.5 
days. Automotive, media and entertainment, and 
government customers have seen the biggest 
improvements in time to remediate, each with at least 
50% improvement since 2022\.

Conclusion
The7th annual Hacker\-Powered Security Report makes it 
clear that the use cases for ethical hacking will continue 
to expand and diversifyfrom securing GenAI 
applications to finding bugs even earlier in the SDLC. 
Organizations that partner with this innovative 
community benefit from the cutting\-edge research and 
techniques that hackers, with their outsider mindset, add 
to the organizations talent pool. The partnership means 
organizations can outpace cybercriminal efforts and 
concentrate on building new, ever\-more\-secure products 
as exploitable vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed 
faster than ever before.
