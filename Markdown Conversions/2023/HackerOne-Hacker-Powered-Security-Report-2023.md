## It’s Riskier Not to Work With Hackers

Cybercrime continues to rise at the same time CISOs are being challenged to do more with less. Research from early 2023¹ revealed that one-third of companies had made security budget cuts in the past 12 months and that a quarter were planning to make cuts in the following 12 months, with 40% saying they were planning to make headcount cuts in the same timeframe. Of the security professionals surveyed, 67% said they believed reducing budget and headcount in security would negatively affect their ability to handle cybersecurity incidents.

In this climate, you’re more at risk if you’re ignoring the benefits a huge community of talented and tenacious ethical hackers can bring to your organization’s security. Thousands of the world’s most influential brands trust hackers to deliver impactful findings and vulnerabilities.

¹ Survey conducted by March 29-31, 2023. Censuswide abides by and employs members of the Market Research Society, which is based on the ESOMAR principles. Respondents include 100 US cybersecurity professionals aged 18+. CensusWide

**Hack•er / noun**
One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations.

96% of HackerOne customers say their organization is better positioned to resist cyberattacks by accepting vulnerability reports from third parties, and 70% say hacker efforts have helped them avoid a significant security incident.

The 7th annual Hacker-Powered Security Report goes deeper than ever before with customer insights, in addition to the opinions of some of the world’s top hackers. We also take a more comprehensive look at the top ten vulnerabilities and how various industries are performing when it comes to incentivizing hackers to find the vulnerabilities that are most important to them.

## What You Will Learn From the Hacker-Powered Security Report

*   **How hackers are using AI and what they can tell you about the security risks**
    55% of hackers say that generative AI (GenAI) tools themselves will become a major target for them in the coming years, and 61% said they plan to use and develop hacking tools using GenAI to find more vulnerabilities. Another 62% of hackers said they plan to specialize in the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models (LLMs).

*   **How to attract the top hackers to your program**
    While nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) remain a hot topic in the hacking community, only 9% of hackers say NDAs put them off hacking a target (down from 11% in 2022) and only 14% are put off by the inability to publicly disclose vulnerabilities (down from 17% in 2022), showing hackers’ adaptability and willingness to work within these constraints.

*   **How your industry compares against the top ten vulnerability stats and why your program may return different results than the HackerOne platform averages**
    When we look at the high and critical vulnerabilities compared against all vulnerability reports, we see a higher ranking for insecure direct object references (IDOR), for example, because these are not vulnerabilities you can scan for. This highlights the importance of human intelligence in seeking out these weaknesses.

*   **How you can save money by incorporating code security audits and pentesting into your bug bounty strategy**
    A code security audit could save you a potential $18,000 on your bounty program.

*   **The latest bounty data and how your median and top bounties stack up against your peers’**
    The median cost of a bug on the HackerOne platform is $500, the average cost is $1,048, and the 90th percentile is $3,000.

## What Motivates Hackers to Find and Report Vulnerabilities

Only one-quarter of hackers hack full-time: nearly two-thirds of hackers spend less than 20 hours a week hacking. Almost one-third of hackers have day jobs in the cybersecurity industry.

"Of course I’m motivated by money, but I also choose programs that offer great communication with the community."
— Tom Anthony, Hacker

While hackers are always looking for generous bounties, they’re motivated by more than just money:

*   80% of hackers hack to earn money (up from 71% in 2022)
*   78% of hackers also say they do it to learn
*   47% of hackers say they hack to protect and defend businesses and end users

## The Industries Hackers Focus On

Internet and online services are a top target for hackers, with 58% spending time on programs in this realm. These organizations pay top bounties and are a dominant presence on the HackerOne platform, making up 25% of all customer programs.

Financial services is a growing sector, with 53% of hackers spending time on these organizations’ programs, up from 44% in 2022.

40% of hackers now hack government organizations, up from 33% in 2022.

Conversely, cryptocurrency and blockchain, which had seen increased ethical hacker activity in prior years, now have fewer hackers focusing on them—down to 16% from 17% in 2022.

Retail and e-commerce platforms remain popular, with 48% of hackers spending time on them, but this is a decrease from 54% in 2022.

*   Internet & online services: 58%
*   Financial services & insurance: 53%
*   Retail & e-commerce: 48%
*   Computer software: 43%
*   Education: 41%
*   Government: 40%
*   Telecommunications: 40%
*   Travel & hospitality: 32%
*   Consumer goods: 30%
*   Professional services: 30%
*   Media & entertainment: 29%
*   Non-profit: 19%
*   Automotive & ground transport: 19%
*   Medical technology: 24%
*   Healthcare: 33%
*   Cryptocurrency & blockchain: 16%
*   Aviation & aerospace: 15%
*   Electronics & semiconductor: 15%
*   Computer hardware & peripherals: 14%

## The Diverse Skill Sets of the Hacking Community

Hackers use a plethora of techniques; while 95% of hackers specialize in web application testing, they also span a range of new and emerging technologies. 47% specialize in network application testing, 20% have experience with social engineering, and 63% do vulnerability research. 36% of hackers say they are most skilled at the reconnaissance part of hacking, and 20% say they are best at exploitation.

"So many hackers specialize in web applications because the majority of internet interactions take place via web applications, meaning that hackers are already very familiar with their mechanisms. Moreover, the attack surface of web applications provides a particularly wide and rich testing ground, with organizations having huge sets of assets across the internet. I also specialize in social engineering. It’s always fascinated me; instead of hacking technical systems, we’re trying to open a window into the human mindset. While it seems that our brain is immensely more complex than a computer, social engineering is the easiest way for a malicious actor to reach their target. Social engineering is more challenging to run as an ethical hacking exercise since the hacker needs to have an understanding of psychology and sociology, while also understanding the ethics behind any assessment."
— Roni Carta a.k.a. @arsene_lupin, Hacker and co-founder of Lupin & Holmes

*   95% Web application testing
*   47% Network penetration testing
*   63% Vulnerability research
*   20% Social engineering testing
*   40% Red team testing
*   10% Purple team testing
*   18% Wireless penetration testing

## Where Hackers Consider Themselves Most Skilled

*   7% AI tools
*   7% Firmware
*   6% Blockchain
*   6% Hardware devices
*   23% Open source
*   55% APIs

## What Hackers Can Tell You About Securing AI

The pressure to rapidly adopt generative artificial intelligence to boost productivity and remain competitive has ramped up to an incredible level. Concurrently, security leaders are trying to understand how to leverage GenAI technology while ensuring protection from inherent security issues and threats. This challenge includes staying ahead of adversaries who may discover and exploit malicious uses before organizations can address them. Ethical hackers have been experimenting with GenAI since 2022 and are already becoming the experts you need on your side.

*   55% of hackers say GenAI tools themselves will become a major target for them in the coming years.
*   61% said they plan to use and develop hacking tools that employ GenAI to find more vulnerabilities.
*   62% of hackers said they plan to specialize in the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models.
*   28% of hackers are concerned about criminal exploitation of AI.
*   66% of hackers said that they do or will use GenAI to write better reports.
*   53% of hackers are using GenAI in some way.

When we asked hackers to rank their concerns about the risks GenAI poses, 28% were most concerned about criminal exploitation of the tool, 22% about disinformation, and 18% about an increase in insecure code.

While 38% of hackers say they think GenAI will reduce the number of vulnerabilities in code, 43% say it will lead to an increase in vulnerabilities.

"There are now suddenly a whole host of attack vectors for AI-powered applications that weren’t possible before. At the simplest level, it’s about tricking the AI into doing or revealing something it shouldn’t. For example, chatbots often have access to company documentation and frequently asked questions. You want the responses to be able to answer users’ questions intelligently but not completely siphon off internal documentation or leak data. Accidental exposure of internal documentation is a very possible attack scenario. One of the reasons for AI security issues is that these applications are new and developing really fast; they don’t necessarily take security very seriously. I’ve spent a lot of time this year looking for those security issues and reporting them to the development teams. The big companies that are creating their own versions of AI tools are more likely to bake security in because they already have a culture that prioritizes security. Hackers are also more likely to be given alpha or beta access to these tools so they can see it first and reveal those vulnerabilities before it goes out the door. From the hacker side, we’re experimenting with using AI to write tools that will help us hack better, but the AI models are getting harder to convince to help with that. However, I think that to be able to compete with the malicious actors, we need access to the same tools and techniques."
— Joseph Thacker, aka @rez0, Hacker specializing in AI

## The OWASP Top Ten Vulnerabilities for Large Language Models

OWASP has already published their top ten vulnerabilities for LLM applications.

1.  **Prompt injection**: The most commonly discussed LLM vulnerability, in which an attacker manipulates the operation of a trusted LLM through crafted inputs, either directly or indirectly.
2.  **Insecure output handling**: Occurs when an LLM output is accepted without scrutiny, potentially exposing backend systems. This can, in some cases, lead to severe consequences like XSS, CSRF, SSRF, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.
3.  **Training data poisoning**: Refers to the manipulation of data or fine-tuning of processes that introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases and could compromise the model’s security, effectiveness, or ethical behavior.
4.  **Model denial of service**: Happens when attackers trigger resource-heavy operations on LLMs, leading to service degradation or high costs.
5.  **Supply chain vulnerabilities**: The supply chain in LLMs can be vulnerable, impacting the integrity of training data, machine learning (ML) models, and deployment platforms. Supply chain vulnerabilities in LLMs can lead to biased outcomes, security breaches, and even complete system failures.
6.  **Sensitive information disclosure**: Happens when LLMs inadvertently reveal confidential data, resulting in the exposure of proprietary algorithms, intellectual property, and private or personal information, leading to privacy violations and other security breaches.
7.  **Insecure plugin design**: The power and usefulness of LLMs can be extended with plugins. However, this does come with the risk of introducing more vulnerable attack surfaces through poor or insecure plugin design.
8.  **Excessive agency**: Typically caused by excessive functionality, permissions, and/or autonomy. One or more of these factors enables damaging actions to be performed in response to unexpected or ambiguous outputs from an LLM.
9.  **Overreliance**: When systems or people depend on LLMs for decision-making or content generation without sufficient oversight. Organizations and the individuals that comprise them can over-rely on LLMs without the knowledge and validation mechanisms required to ensure information is accurate, vetted, and secure.
10. **Model theft**: Where there is unauthorized access, copying, or exfiltration of proprietary LLM models. This can lead to economic loss, reputational damage, and unauthorized access to highly sensitive data.

## What Are Your Biggest Security Risks?

We asked customers where they thought their biggest risks came from. 57% of customers said the greatest threat to their organization is exploited vulnerabilities. 10% said nation-state actors, 22% said phishing, and 12% said insider threats.

We also asked hackers what they think are the biggest security challenges organizations face. Lack of in-house skills and expertise was the top response, with 32% saying this was the biggest challenge. 91% of HackerOne customers say that hackers provide more impactful and valuable vulnerability reports than AI or scanning solutions.

**What is your organization most concerned about?**
*   59% Exploited vulnerabilities
*   22% Phishing
*   13% Insider threats
*   9% Nation-state actors
*   12% Third-party software
*   11% Infrequent testing

**What are organizations biggest security risks according to hackers?**
*   32% Lack of in-house skills and expertise
*   23% Lack of visibility into the attack surface
*   22% Insufficiently deep testing
*   11% Infrequent testing

## How to Keep Hackers Motivated for the Best Results

Whether you’re running a bug bounty, pentest, or code security audit program, you benefit by attracting the best hackers to participate. We asked hackers what makes for a program they want to hack on.

Bounties are the main attraction to a program, with 73% choosing a program because it pays generous bounties. However, other attractive factors include the anticipation that a lot of vulnerabilities will be available to find on a target (50% of hackers named this), and a varied scope (which attracts 46% of hackers). 17% of hackers will spend time on a program due to the relationship they have with the organization’s security team.

When it comes to turning hackers off a program, it’s all about the experience; poor communication puts off 55% of hackers and slow response times put off 60%. Just 9% of hackers say NDAs disincentivize them to hack a target, and only 14% are put off by a prohibition on publicly disclosing vulnerabilities they find. Both of those numbers are down slightly from 2022. These numbers illustrate the adaptability of hackers—and the viability of ethical hackers as a solution even for organizations that may require these common legal and disclosure restraints.

"When I’m looking at a new program, I will look at the metrics in terms of time to triage and bounty and to what degree the program is hitting those metrics. I would advise companies to have both a public and private program. The public program, will screen and interview researchers that can be moved into the private program where you can provide them with more access and resources. A private program allows you to have an elite group of hackers really digging in and finding those critical vulnerabilities. For example, some hackers specialize in reconnaissance and finding those corners of infrastructure that no one is thinking about and looking in the corners, then you have other hackers that have hundreds of servers scanning for vulnerabilities. Novelty and scale are important for delivering impactful reports."
— Tom Anthony, Hacker

## How Much Can You Expect to Pay for a Bug?

The median price of a bug on the HackerOne platform is $500, up from $400 in 2022. The average bounty in the 90th percentile is up from $2,500 to $3,000. The automotive industry, which is just emerging on the HackerOne platform, has seen the largest increase in bounties. As security leaders in this sector gain understanding and confidence in ethical hacking, hackers are increasingly incentivized to seek out impactful bugs.

**The Average, Median, and 90th Percentile for Bounties on the HackerOne Platform**

| Industry                  | Median Bounty | Average Bounty | 90th Percentile |
| :------------------------ | :------------ | :------------- | :-------------- |
| Telecoms                  | $0.5k         | $1k            | $3k             |

| Travel & Hospitality      | $0.5k         | $1k            | $3k             |

**Average bounty for all industries:** $1k
**90th percentile average for all industries:** $3k

Things get more interesting when we break down bounties by high and critical vulnerabilities. Crypto and blockchain organizations continue to pay the highest bounties, with the top award reaching $100,050 in this industry. Computer software and internet and online services are also offering highly competitive rewards for the most critical vulnerabilities. The more security-mature industries can afford to be more generous with the top bounties, as they receive fewer high and critical vulnerabilities. 26% of vulnerabilities reported to internet and online services organizations are high and critical, and only 22% of those reported to crypto and blockchain are high or critical.

**The Average, Median, and 90th Percentile for Bounties on the HackerOne Platform (High/Critical Vulnerabilities)**

| Industry                  | Median Bounty | Average Bounty | 90th Percentile |
| :------------------------ | :------------ | :------------- | :-------------- |
| Telecoms                  | $2k           | $4.2k          | $12k            |

| Travel & Hospitality      | $3k           | $3.1k          | $5k             |

**Average bounty for all industries:** $3.7k
**90th percentile average for all industries:** $12k

There are now 29 hackers that have earned over $1 million in bounties on the HackerOne platform.

"Since 2019, Zoom has worked with 900 hackers, of which 300 have submitted vulnerabilities that we have had to quickly move on. We’ve paid out over $7 million. It’s a substantial investment but the returns are worth it: we find world-class talent to find real-world solutions before it’s a real-world problem."
— Michael Adams, CISO, Zoom

## More Than Just Bug Bounty

Ethical hackers can support customers at multiple points across the software development life cycle (SDLC). Development is where organizations can introduce (and find) the most bugs.

| SDLC Stage | HackerOne Offering | Description                                                              |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development| Code Security Audit| Secure auditing of your codebase. Analysis on code changes and live applications. |
| Test       | Pentest            | Frequent testing to validate coverage.                                   |
| Release    | Bug Bounty Program | Continuous testing by security experts.                                  |
| Operate    | Bug Bounty Program | Continuous testing by security experts.                                  |

In fact, bug bounty is truly a last line of defense because it covers all of your assets in production.

Top programs use bug bounty as a compass—a tool to help navigate an attack surface to find gaps in security testing coverage. Top-tier security teams leverage bounty programs as a performance monitoring system for their internal security strategy and a safety net that automatically deploys when other security testing systems and processes fail.

Bugs that slip through to production can be used to identify and resolve underlying challenges in security programs. The output of a bug bounty program can help identify improvement opportunities in the SDLC to implement or bolster controls such as:

*   Secure development training
*   Static application testing
*   Human code review
*   Small pentests/security hygiene checks

A well-integrated bug bounty program pinpoints challenges across the full vulnerability management landscape, including remediation practices, SLAs, stakeholder relationships, and pentesting habits. By learning from the outputs, an organization can systematically tighten its security controls to the point where novel and elusive bugs—those that can only be identified by human expertise—become a more frequently reported class of vulnerability.

## Find Mistakes Early With a Code Security Audit

In the past year, a specialized cohort of the HackerOne community, including a group of rigorously vetted, specialized software engineers and security experts, has performed over 30,000 code reviews. Each review takes a median of 88 minutes to complete and surfaces an average of 1.2 vulnerabilities. 18% of security fixes are incomplete, making them one of the most essential types of code changes to audit.

**Vulnerabilities that are most likely to be discovered in a code security audit:**

*   **Design flaws and logic errors**: Code audits can uncover design flaws and logic errors that might not be immediately apparent during production testing.
*   **Insecure coding practices**: Input validation and output encoding issues, lack of proper error handling, inadequate access controls, and other insecure coding practices can lead to various attacks, including injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and privilege escalation.
*   **Hidden backdoors and malicious code**: These are sometimes intentionally or unintentionally inserted into the codebase, and are often difficult to detect through traditional production testing methods alone.
*   **Sensitive data leakage**: Data such as hard-coded credentials, API keys, or encryption keys are often stored insecurely within the code.
*   **Cryptographic vulnerabilities**: Security vulnerabilities related to cryptography—such as weak encryption algorithms, improper key management, and insecure random number generation—are more likely to be found during a code audit due to their code-centric nature.
*   **Application and Infrastructure-as-Code misconfigurations**: These might lead to security vulnerabilities such as incorrect and missing security settings, default configurations, or insecure cloud configurations.
*   **Insecure dependencies**: Code audits that include software composition analysis (SCA) can easily uncover vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies that the application might use.
*   **Unintended information disclosure**: Sensitive information—such as debug information, comments, or metadata—might unintentionally leak details about the application's internals and infrastructure.

Finding these vulnerabilities before a product has shipped delivers significant savings.

² Calculations based off median bounty reward figures across a sample of 1,100+ active HackerOne programs

*   **$29,437** Estimated bounty cost if found in bug bounty program
*   **$18,037** Estimated bounty cost savings
*   **$11,400** Estimated bounty cost savings

Eliminating bugs before live user data is at risk: Priceless.

## Ensure Compliance With Industry Standards via Pentest as a Service (PTaaS)

A penetration test (pentest) involves identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, similar to a bug bounty program, but a pentest often leans more toward ensuring an organization adheres to specific compliance and security standards. Pentests typically follow a structured methodology that encompasses a comprehensive, time-bound examination of the system, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities that adversaries could exploit.

"One thing people don’t consider, including companies that want to sell us pentesting, is the advantage of running everything through one platform. Having one platform for a very wide range of offensive security testing avoids the need to onboard lots of different vendors, platforms, and so on. This creates a significant time and cost saving."
— George Gerchow, CISO and SVP IT, Sumo Logic

*   54% increase in pentests since 2022
*   16% increase in the number of vulnerabilities being surfaced by pentests
*   15% of vulnerabilities found being rated as high or critical severity

Vulnerabilities such as insufficient session expiration or violation of secure design principles are more likely to be identified during a pentest. This is because pentests often aim to ensure compliance with security standards and help pass audits, focusing on revealing weaknesses stemming from a lack of secure development processes. Audits typically target weaknesses like issues with session expiration or secure design principle violations, making them more likely to be discovered during a pentest. However, since vulnerabilities like insufficient session expiration are not inherently exploitable because they require additional conditions to pose a real threat, they may not lead to payouts in a bug bounty program, where exploitable vulnerabilities are prioritized.

We’ve seen a 54% increase in pentests since 2022, and a 16% increase in the number of vulnerabilities being surfaced by pentests, with 15% of vulnerabilities found being rated as high or critical severity. On average, 11 valid vulnerabilities are reported per pentest.

## Incentivize Novel and Elusive Vulnerabilities With a Bug Bounty

Once you have conducted a thorough code security audit or pentest to identify and address a range of vulnerabilities, it’s crucial to continue this proactive security approach. A bug bounty program is a comprehensive and offensive strategy to further cover your bases. It incentivizes a broad spectrum of ethical hackers to apply their diverse skills and creativity in rooting out even the most novel and elusive vulnerabilities in your shipped products—ensuring robust, multi-layered security.

After launching a bug bounty, the median time to receive the first valid report is 20 days. Hackers are reporting 13% more critical bugs in 2023, and 15% more high-severity bugs. Critical or high-rated bugs make up 29% of valid bug bounty reports.
