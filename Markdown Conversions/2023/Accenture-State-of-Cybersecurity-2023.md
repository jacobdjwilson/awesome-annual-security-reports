not always fast enough to bring about elite performance.4The next wave of business 
transformation will morph from 
managing isolated digital capabilities to 
creating the foundations of a shared 
reality. It will converge the physical lives 
weve been leading with the digital ones 
weve been rapidly expanding. In such 
an environment, organizations should 
embed cybersecurity each step of the 
way to better manage these high stakes.Securing transformation successMarket disruptionfueled by 
technological change, complex 
regulations, geopolitical 
tensions and economic 
uncertaintiesis testing global 
organizations approach to risk 
and resilience.As our Total Enterprise Reinvention 
research shows, most large 
organizations are transforming faster 
and more frequently.Our latest cybersecurity research 
reveals some organizations are using 
cybersecurity as a differentiator to 
deliver better business outcomes. Those 
organizations that closely align their 
cybersecurity programs to business 
objectives are 18% more likely to 
increase their ability to drive revenue 
growth, increase market share and 
improve customer satisfaction, trust and 
employee productivity.Whats more, organizations that embed 
key cybersecurity actions into their digital 
transformation efforts and apply strong 
cybersecurity operational practices 
across the organization are nearly six 
times more likely to experience more 
effective digital transformations than 
those that dont do both.Yet, some organizations arent engaging 
cybersecurity early enough to accelerate 
transformation and meet future 
challenges and opportunities.We found that, when it comes to 
embedding security controls, 18% of our 
survey respondents still deploy them after
theyve finalized a transformation effort
and thats only if vulnerabilities are 
detected.It could be a case of too little, too late. As 
a recent study found, the discovery of an 
error due to poor application security in 
an app's coding phase, instead of during 
initial planning, costs five times as much 
to fixand that soars to 30 times the cost 
post\-release.15Securingtransformation successBy converting cybersecurity 
from an incident\-driven 
reaction into part of the fabric 
of transformation efforts, 
organizations can not only 
boost cybersecurity resilience, 
but also position themselves 
to reinvent the whole 
enterprise and set a new 
performance frontier, safely.67Cybersecurity as a changemakerOur annual State of Cybersecurity Resilience research involved 
3,000 global respondents from 15 industries across 14 countries.Survey responses show that 
more than one\-half of 
organizations are beginning to 
recognize the importance of 
being secure from the start in 
any transformation effort.53%said that cybersecurity is 
part of the core 
transformation team\&53%said that cybersecurity is 
required before any 
solution is deployedSource: Accenture State of Cybersecurity Resilience 
2023; N \= 3,000 security executives and business leaders8Cybersecurity as a changemakerWe discovered that the majority of organizations undergoing digital 
transformation, in our sample, increase their chances of being fully satisfied 
with the level of cybersecurity embedded in their digital transformation 
efforts by 10% if they follow three actions.Three cybersecurity actions to boosttransformation:1\.2\.3\.Require cybersecurity controls before 
all new solutions are deployedApply cybersecurity incrementally 
as each digital transformation 
milestone is achievedAssign a cybersecurity representative to 
the core transformation team and a point 
person to orchestrate cybersecurity 
across all transformation initiatives9Cybersecurity as a changemakerOur recently released Resilience for Reinvention study2 shows that companies 
achieving long\-term profitable growth display a commitment toward developing 
a digital core, which consists of three layers: infrastructure and security; data and 
artificial intelligence (AI); and applications and platforms.They also demonstrate a 
consistently higher share of 
investments in new technologies, 
innovation and cybersecurity.The

coreApplications and platformsData and AIInfrastructure and security10Cybersecurity as a changemakerIn this latest State of Cybersecurity Resilience research, we find that some organizations
representing 30% of respondentsare already proving how prioritizing cybersecurity makes 
a difference. These organizationswe call them cyber transformershave accelerated digital 
transformation efforts and plan to continue accelerating them as their high\-performing 
cybersecurity actions propel them forward (Figure 1\).Figure 1\. Cyber transformers accelerate digital transformationCyber transformersThe rest0%30%100%11Cybersecurity as a changemakerAnd like the cyber champions in our 2021 report, this years cyber 
transformers strike a balance between excelling at cyber resilience and 
aligning with the business strategy to achieve better business outcomes.12Cybersecurity as a changemakerCyber transformers closely align cybersecurity programs to business objectives. 
In doing so, they are 18% more likely to increase the following outcomes: Their ability to achieve target revenue growth and market share
 Improved customer satisfaction and trust Greater employee productivityAdditionally, cyber 
transformers are nearly twice 
as good as the rest at 
involving the cybersecurity 
team from the start of

are far more comfortable with 
their organizations internal

between cyber transformers and the rest.Cyber 
transformersThe rest65% of cyber transformers apply three 
leading practices to excel at risk 
management. By contrast, just 11% of the 
rest adopt this best\-in\-class approach.Source: Accenture State of

1Integrate cyber risk: A cyber risk\-based 
framework is completely integrated into 
their enterprise risk management program2\. Agree on priorities: Their cybersecurity 
2
operations and executive leadership 
consistently agree on the priority of assets 
and operations to protect3\. Look at risk holistically: They consider 
3cybersecurity risk to a great extent when 
evaluating overall enterprise riskCase studyFor example, by choosing to integrate 
cybersecurity risk into its broader enterprise 
risk management framework, a global travel 
company was able to gain better risk 
management, improved compliance with 
regulatory requirements and enhanced 
protection for its business and its customers.This industry\-leading and comprehensive 
approach to enterprise risk management 
enabled the company to gain a deeper, 
holistic understanding of the security risks 
associated with third\-party vendors and IT 
systems, as well as better preparedness and 
recovery planning in the event of a breach.17What it takes to be a cyber transformerCyber transformers more frequently use 
cybersecurity\-as\-a\-service to enhance operations.40% of cyber transformers use third 
parties or managed services 
providers to administer cybersecurity 
operations and address talent 
shortages, versus 24% of the rest.Case studyWhen a North American retail chain 
became a standalone public company, 
it needed to rethink its IT operations. 
Accenture was asked to support the 
retailers focused security team by 
expanding into a cybersecurity\-as\-a\-
service model, initially running the 
companys security operations, such as 
threat intelligence and establishing a 
Security Operations Center (SOC).Today, Accenture provides a range of 
services including data protection, 
identity management, network security, 
vulnerability management, security 
awareness and risk management.Improving its cybersecurity operations 
enabled the company to innovate 
continuously, run its store operations 
without disruption and maintain 
consumer trust.The retailer gained 
improved cyber resilience and business 
outcomes by being secure from the start.18What it takes to be a cyber transformerCyber transformers are more committed 
to protecting their ecosystem.Based on our analysis, cyber 
transformers performed better than 
the rest when it comes to taking 
action to protect their ecosystems.For example, cyber transformers more often 
incorporate their ecosystem or supply chain 
partners into their incident response plan (45% 
vs. 37%) and also require them to meet strict 
cybersecurity standards (41% vs. 29%).While 
these ecosystem actions provide cyber 
transformers with a 10% advantage over the 
rest, there is room for improvement.Case studyA leading pharmaceutical 
company collaborated with Amazon 
Web Services (AWS) to accelerate drug 
development, increase operational 
agility, reduce technology costs and 
develop the workforce of the future.To create a more scalable, reliable and 
secure architecture, the company 
moved 80% of its applications to the 
cloud, removing non\-differentiating 
technology, reducing its internal data 
center footprint, decreasing capital 
expenditures and improving resilience.Customers, employees and partners can 
benefit from the companys ability to 
respond with greater speed, agility and 
insights across the value chain which, in 
turn, improves patient experiences.Accelerating the delivery of data services 
and capabilities can help the company 
increase secure connectivity and 
collaboration with the Life Sciences 
ecosystem and external partners.19What it takes to be a cyber transformerCyber transformers rely heavily on automation.89% of cyber transformers rely 
heavily on automation, compared 
with just 57% of the rest.Whats more, 96% of respondents whose 
organizations substantially automate their 
cybersecurity programs recognize that 
automation helps them alleviate cyber talent 
shortages, a key challenge for any company 
seeking cyber resilience.As evidence of a 
man\+machine approach becoming more 
mainstream, Accenture analysis has found 
that the share of cybersecurity\-related AI 
patents increased 2\.7X between January 
2017 and October 2022\.Case studyIn our own organization of 738,000 
employees, weve embraced AI and 
automation through our Intelligent 
Application Security Platform. The 
platform uses leading commercial 
scanning tools to perform application 
security testing at scale and to discover 
vulnerabilities and code issues. It also 
automates, orchestrates and scales 
onboarding applications as well as 
application testing and pipeline gating.The platform uses an artificial 
intelligence\-powered filter that 
removes and reduces vulnerabilities
from several thousand to a few
resulting in a curated and more 
manageable process.As a result, the scanning service has 
helped application teams save 
thousands of hours through the 
automated removal of false positive 
findings generated by scanning tools.20What it takes to be a cyber transformerFast\-emerging AI 
developments such as 
generative AI can drive a new 
wave of cybersecurity 
advances.In time, generative AI could support enterprise 
governance and information security, protecting 
against fraud, improving regulatory compliance, 
and proactively identifying risk by drawing cross\-
domain connections and inferences both within 
and outside the organization.3Indeed, the emergence of ChatGPT has already 
brought both disruption and opportunity, offering 
the rapid advancement of cybersecurity 
capabilities such as threat detection, analysis and 
response and accelerated use of automation to 
reduce workload and augment staffing.As one CISO noted:There is an argument for automating 
Security Operations Center (SOC) level\-
one supportthings like creating Yara 
rules and more complex queries. 
Generative AI already has this capability. 
However, I believe youre still going to 
need human oversight.21What it takes to be a cyber transformerAs our research shows, Total Enterprise Reinvention is a deliberate 
strategy that aims to set a new performance frontier for companies and 
in most cases, the industries in which they operate.Cyber transformers are well placed 
to execute that reinvention strategy 
through gains that are a direct result 
of differentiated cybersecurity 
practices and behaviors.And while cybersecurity incidents will still 
happen every day, on average, cyber 
transformers report 26% lower cost of 
breaches and cybersecurity incidents in the 
past 12 months than the restthats more than 
a quarter of all costs that could be allocated 
across the enterprise to optimize operations, 
fuel growth and improve resilience.Case studyA large retail and commercial bank 
introduced agile cybersecurity decision 
making while undertaking two digital 
transformations: moving to a private 
cloud and creating new product 
offerings using the public cloud.The banks decentralized operating 
model, coupled with embedding 
cybersecurity early in the digital 
transformation process, has helped to 
reduce risks and vulnerabilities, improve 
data protection and enhance its overall 
security posture.Whats more, the bank has reduced costs 
and downtime while improving 
complianceand enhancing its reputation 
as a secure and trustworthy organization.2223Extra pressure pointsWhile managing secure digital transformation is an important consideration, our 
research shows there are other ongoing issues that continue to put pressure on all 
organizations and influence the state of cybersecurity resilience. Looking across our 
entire set of global respondents, these additional pressure points were revealed.An uncertain geopolitical landscape is 
accelerating threats and attacksThe whole approach to cyber risk is 
under scrutiny, inside and outsideTheres still room for improvement in 
cybersecurity and business alignmentOrganizations cyber resilience is 
under pressure from ongoing 
geopolitical tensions, especially 
through their supply chains, physical 
infrastructure and external networks.Organizations are failing to keep pace 
with the scope and scale of cyber risk.Organizations are better aligning 
cybersecurity with business leadership, 
but there are gaps in the effectiveness 
of their approach.24Extra pressure pointsAn uncertain geopolitical landscape is 
accelerating threats and attacksOrganizations cyber resilience is 
under pressure from ongoing 
geopolitical tensions, especially 
through their supply chains, 
physical infrastructure and 
external networks, such as 
investment partners.The influence of Russias aggression in the 
Ukraine is being felt by almost everyone. 
Nearly all organizations (97%) have seen an 
increase in cyber threats since the start of 
the Russia\-Ukraine war and almost all survey 
respondents have taken some action.51% of organizations have updated their 
business continuity and enterprise risk plans 
and nearly half have increased their incident 
response capabilities. At the same time, only 
39% of organizations are prioritizing close 
collaboration with government agencies on 
policies and recommendations in response 
to the war.More than half (54%) see third 
parties and external networks as the most 
susceptible areas for attack.Indeed, consistent with last years findings, 
the percentage of successful breaches from 
outside the organization remains high, even 
nudging slightly ahead (61% compared to 
60% last year), while for some industries, 
such as Utilities, supply chain partner threats 
are higher again at 62%.25Extra pressure pointsThe whole approach to cyber risk is under 
scrutiny, inside and outsideOrganizations are failing to 
keep pace with the scope 
and scale of cyber risk.And accelerating transformation 
without addressing security along 
the way can open the door to 
greater risk.Cyber risk management is 
challenging inside the 
organization. Less than half of all 
survey respondents said that just 
one aspect of enterprise risk 
managementtheir cyber risk\-
based frameworkis completely 
integrated within the enterprise 
risk management program.The regulatory landscape plays a 
part here, with risk integration 
leaping to 81% in the highly 
regulated Banking industry or 
65% for the Software and 
Platforms sector.While 35% of respondents said 
they embed security controls in all 
transformation initiatives from the 
beginning, there are still 18% who 
deploy security after the event. To 
transform at speed, security should 
be baked in, otherwise 
organizations can expect to incur 
more cost or rework down the 
line (Figure 3\).Cyber risk is also mounting outside 
the organization, where cyber 
threats are increasing due to 
changes in the threat landscape 
and cybersecurity omissions leave 
organizations exposed.Figure 3\. The security of digital transformation effortsDeploy security after transformation is initialized 
only if vulnerabilities are detected, ensuring we can 
move transformation as fast as possibleImplement security controls, only for critical 
functions, balancing speed and risk managementEmbed security controls in all transformation 
initiatives from the beginningSource: Accenture State of Cybersecurity Resilience 2023
N \= 2,500 security executives and 500 business leadersFor example, Russias invasion of 
Ukraine spurred reaction from 
executives to address 
cybersecurity practices, such as 
updates to business continuity, 
incident response and increasing 
employee cyber awareness.Indeed, only one\-third of all 
respondents (35%) consider 
cybersecurity risk to a great 
extent when evaluating overall 
enterprise risk; this highlights 
there is still some way to go to 
make cybersecurity a proactive, 
strategic necessity within 
the business.26Extra pressure pointsTheres still room for improvement in 
cybersecurity and business alignmentOrganizations are better at aligning 
cybersecurity with business 
leadership, but there are gaps in the 
effectivenessof the approach.Business leaders (CEO and CFO respondents 
in the research) expect CISOs to go beyond 
their traditional technical role to act as a 
representative of the organization. Business 
leaders reported the importance of CISOs 
adopting certain characteristics, such as 
translating the technical aspects of 
cybersecurity to the CEO and Board (44%), 
leading the response during breaches (42%) 
and establishing trust with customers (41%).As one CISO reported:The biggest hurdle security 
leaders have is executive 
presence. You need to 
demonstrate business 
capability and value and 
engage in conversations 
that are about more than 
just security.These findings underscore the importance 
of having a business\-led CISO who acts as 
an educator and collaborator with non\-
security audiences.In particular, theres a gap between CISOs 
and business leaders when it comes to a 
post\-breach communication strategy to the 
general public. And yet, as every 
organization who has experienced an attack 
knows, in the middle of a crisis, its critical to 
provide quick, transparent communications 
to inform and reassure stakeholders.Nearly half of CISOs said that no defined 
executive was responsible for 
communicating externally during a breach.27Extra pressure pointsTheres still room for improvement in 
cybersecurity and business alignmentIn addition, the differences in opinion 
between CISOs and business leaders 
about this responsibility may indicate a 
lack of clarity for post\-breach 
communication (Figure 4\).This is a red flag for the whole enterprise 
as it attempts to limit the damage of a 
breach to its brand and customer 
satisfaction scores, identified as the most 
important consideration following a 
breach by 50% of our survey respondents.Organizations have a responsibility to 
define a crisis communications strategy 
that is agile, that considers the 
complexities of cyber events and that 
clearly defines roles and responsibilities for 
communicating with stakeholders.Figure 4\. Communication responsibilities during a breachSecurity executivesBusiness leadersSource: Accenture State of Cybersecurity Resilience2023\. N \= 2,500 security executives and 500 business leaders2829Where next?Realistically, if youre not looking at 
cybersecurity holistically, youre not 
fully protecting your business30Where next?Heres how you can employ cybersecurity to drive better resultsEmbed cybersecurity to 
protect the digital coreApply cybersecurity to 
reconcile digital and 
physical worldsMake cybersecurity 
part of the fabric of 
transformationSecurity is critical to enabling business 
agility and scalability as well as driving 
continued innovation and establishing an 
organizations digital coreone that 
empowers employees and departments to 
experiment and scale while mitigating risk.What you can do: Take the three 
cybersecurity actions and establish a 
strong foundation with cybersecurity 
operational practices 
to improve business outcomes and 
overall performance.Increased access, devices, software and 
connectivity across the Cloud Continuum 
and legacy environments has resulted in 
an ever\-expanding threat surface. And 
while generative AI4 can herald a new era 
of agility and cyber protection, it also acts 
as a new threat vector for cyber criminals.What you can do
Invest in understanding your data, its value 
and who has access. Re\-examine 
enterprise and customer identity to better 
bridge the physical and digital worlds. 
Establish enhanced monitoring and 
visibility across both legacy and cloud 
environments using endpoint detection 
and response (EDR) and security 
orchestration, automation and response 
(SOAR) technologies.The traditional approach to 
cybersecurity is unsustainable. A global 
shortage of cybersecurity talent to 
handle ongoing threats is compounded 
by fewer people available to handle the 
effects of cyberattacks on an 
organizations business continuity, 
economics and reputation. The lines are 
becoming blurred around when 
transformation begins and ends.What you can doMake cybersecurity a cornerstone of 
your transformation efforts and elevate 
the CISO reporting so that the function 
is fundamental to business 
transformation efforts.31Where next?From risk assessment and management to 
security control implementation, and from 
security awareness and training to 
incident response and recovery, 
cybersecurity is essential to maintain 
dynamic protection in every 
transformation program. Whats more, as 
our cyber transformers show, business 
leaders have an opportunity to make 
cybersecuritys impact extend beyond 
protecting the business in the here and 
now, to actively influence continuous, 
dynamic reinvention.3233DemographicsOur State of Cybersecurity

We used LexisNexis patents data in our Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) approach to select patents related to 
cybersecurity, including AI. Using publication data between 
January 2017 and October 2022, we ran trend analysis to 
understand the evolution of AI\-related patents share in the 
overall number of cybersecurity\-focused patents.MethodologySurvey data analysisWe used standard survey data analysis to understand the 
overall landscape as well as characteristics of various 
groups in our sample; in particular we compared cyber 
transformers who made up 30% of the security executives 
in the sample (741 respondents) and the rest of the security 
executives (1,759 respondents). We defined cyber 
transformers as organizations that have accelerated digital 
transformation efforts and plan to continue accelerating 
them over the next two years.Composite indicatorsWe constructed two independent indexes to capture how 
advanced companies are in more complex areas.1\.Ecosystem protection index. Incorporates our survey 
data and is based on the number of positive answers to 
questions on ecosystem protection actions that an 
organization is taking. Equal weighting was applied. The 
index is distributed on a scale 0\-100\.2\. Alignment and governance index. Using last years 
definition of alignment, we applied this years survey 
data to construct the index. The index is based on 
answers to questions on how organizations align their 
security to business objectives and what governance 
practices they apply. Equal weighting was applied. The 
index is distributed on a scale 0\-100 and was part of 
the metric used in our logistic regression analysis.Logistic regression econometric algorithmTo estimate the relationship between the probability of a 
successful outcome and organizations practices, we 
applied a logistic regression approach.Both models 
were controlled with respect to the organizations size, 
geographic location and the industry where they operate:1\. Business outcomes analysiswe analyzed therelationship between the level of business alignment 
and governance, measured with the alignment and 
governance index, and the probability that a company 
positively impacts with cybersecurity in all of the 
following outcomes:Increased ability to achieve target revenue growthIncrease in market shareIncrease in customer satisfaction and trustIncrease in employee productivity.2\. Secure transformation efforts analysiswe looked at 
the probability of being highly satisfied with secure 
transformation efforts. We tested the relationship with 
secure transformation key practices for selected 
cohorts in the survey sample.35GlossaryCompressed transformation is transforming 
multiple parts of the business at the same 
time or executing a single large 
transformation much faster than ever before.Digital core is fundamental to all other 
strategic needs of an enterprise. Amplifying 
the role of technology in reinvention means 
shifting from a technology landscape of static, 
standalone parts to interoperable pieces 
intentionally integrated and leveraging the 
cloud. The digital core consists of three layers: 
an infrastructure and security layer; a data and 
AI layer; an applications and platforms layer. 
Building a strong digital core is not a one\-time 
project. It must be continuous to incorporate 
new technologies and business capabilities.Total Enterprise Reinvention is a deliberate 
strategy that aims to set a new performance 
frontier for companies and in most cases, 
the industries in which they operate. 
Centered around a strong digital core, it 
helps drive growth and optimize operations. 
It requires a strategy for continuous, 
dynamic reinvention. It becomes a unifying 
force, across the C\-suite and every function 
and business area, because, by definition, all 
are involved and accountable for its 
success. It demands an outside\-in 
perspective that connects whats happening 
at the organization with whats happening in 
the world. And it requires new skills and an 
increased depth of understanding of 
technology, change management, 
communication and how to work with 
partners to achieve results faster (Figure 5\).Figure 5\. The six differentiating characteristics 
of Total Enterprise Reinvention123456Reinvention is the strategy. It is no 
longer an execution lever.The digital core becomes a primary 
source of competitive advantage. It 
leverages the power of cloud, data, and AI 
through an interoperable set of systems 
across the enterprise that allows for rapid 
development of new capabilities.Reinvention goes beyond benchmarks, 
embracing the art of the possible. 
Technology and new ways of working 
create a new performance frontier.Talent strategy and people impact 
are central to reinvention, not an 
afterthought. These companies consider 
change management a core competency.Reinvention is boundaryless and breaks 
down organizational silos. It tackles 
capabilities end\-to\-end.Reinvention is continuous. It is no longer 
a time\-defined one\-off, but a capability 
continuously tapped by the organization.36References1 Dig8ital
