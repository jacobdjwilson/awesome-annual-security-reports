### Securing our future together
Introduction from Tom Burt
Over the last year, threats to digital peace have reduced trust in technology and highlighted the urgent need for improved cyber defenses at all levels. Encouragingly, defenders the world over are responding to the call to improve security with the public and private sectors investing and collaborating to confront the challenges and build long‑term resilience.
In this fourth annual edition of the Microsoft Digital Defense Report, we draw on our unique vantage point to share insights on how the threat landscape has evolved and discuss the shared opportunities and challenges we all face in securing a resilient online ecosystem which the world can depend on.
> “Close collaboration between the public and private sectors to formulate, enforce, and harmonize these requirements is crucial to improve global cybersecurity and foster innovation.”

“As the digital domain faces new and more threatening challenges, defenders are being driven to innovate and collaborate more closely than ever.”
As the digital domain faces new and more threatening challenges, defenders are being driven to innovate and collaborate more closely than ever.
For example, Russia’s use of cyberweapons as part of its hybrid war against Ukraine sparked sustained collaboration between Microsoft and Ukrainian officials to successfully defend against most of these cyberweapons.
Russia is not alone in its use of destructive malware; we have also seen increased use of cyberweapons by Iran to pressure the Albanian government and in its ongoing conflict with Israel. At the same time, nation states are becoming increasingly sophisticated and aggressive in their cyber espionage efforts, led by highly capable Chinese actors focused on the Asia Pacific region in particular.
One recent example of the troubling increase in aggression and capability involves a Chinese actor, which Microsoft calls Volt Typhoon. It used inventive tradecraft to infiltrate and pre‑position malware in the networks of a range of communications companies and other critical infrastructure organizations in Guam and the United States, deploying “living off the land” techniques to evade detection.
Nation‑state actors were not alone in stepping up their abuse of the digital ecosystem. Well‑resourced cybercriminal syndicates also continue to grow and evolve, leveraging the cybercrime-as-a-service ecosystem we highlighted last year. Ransomware‑as‑a-service and phishing-as-a-service are key threats to businesses and cybercriminals have conducted business email compromise and other cybercrimes, largely undeterred by the increasing commitment of global law enforcement resources.
Many vendors are taking steps to improve the cybersecurity of their products and services, developing new tools to help customers better defend against attackers. Governments across the globe are providing the public with more information about cyber threats and how to counter them, like the effective alerts from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Shields Up campaign. Governments are also imposing new legal and regulatory requirements for cybersecurity. While many of these are beneficial, they can impose counterproductive conditions—such as requiring overly rapid reporting of cybersecurity incidents or establishing inconsistent or conflicting requirements across agencies or geographies. Close collaboration between the public and private sectors to formulate, enforce, and harmonize these requirements is crucial to improve global cybersecurity and foster innovation.
As we are seeing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are set to become a major focus of regulators and industry. We will undoubtedly see attackers using AI as a tool to refine phishing messages, develop malware and enable other abuses of technology. But AI will also be a critical component of successful defense. For example, in Ukraine we saw the first successful use of AI technology to help defend against Russian cyberattacks. In the coming years, innovation in AI‑powered cyber defense will help reverse the tide of cyberattacks.
Advancing the promise of digital peace requires public‑private collaboration to ensure we are bringing to bear the best technological and regulatory tools to combat cyber aggression. We need more and deeper alliances in the private sector and stronger partnerships between the private and public sectors. Enabling this collaboration can be challenging but, when successful, it drives meaningful impact. We must accelerate the move of critical computing workloads to the cloud, where vendors’ security innovations will be most impactful, and ensure AI innovation provides defenders with the durable technological advantage over attackers that it promises.

### Sharing Microsoft’s unique vantage point
Cybersecurity is a defining challenge of our time. Organizations of every size across every industry around the globe feel the urgency and pressure of protecting and defending against increasingly sophisticated attacks.
While AI is transforming cybersecurity, using it to stay ahead of threats requires massive amounts of diverse data. Here at Microsoft, our more than 10,000 security experts analyze over 65 trillion signals each day with the help of AI, and Microsoft Threat Intelligence teams track hundreds of threat actor groups worldwide. The Microsoft security ecosystem includes more than 15,000 security partners with specialized solutions, while the global open community of security researchers and testers contribute to bug bounties and security challenges.
This broad, deep, and diverse security ecosystem is driving some of the most influential insights in cybersecurity. Together, we can build cyber resilience through innovative action and collective defense.
As part of our longstanding commitment to create a safer world, Microsoft’s investments in security research, innovation, and the global security community include:
- **65 trillion signals synthesized daily**
That is over 750 billion signals per second, synthesized using sophisticated data analytics and AI algorithms to understand and protect against digital threats and criminal cyberactivity.
- **300+ threat actors tracked**
Microsoft Threat Intelligence has grown to track more than 300 unique threat actors, including 160 nation-state actors, 50 ransomware groups, and hundreds of others.

All data is based on Microsoft fiscal year 2023 unless otherwise indicated.

### The power of partnership in building cyber resilience
For more about the power of partnerships, please see the Collective Defense chapter on page 108.
We believe every individual and company around the world should be empowered to meet its security needs. Achieving this will require a collective global effort as we harness the power of partnership to strengthen our defenses together.
Strength in numbers. Stronger together. Together we stand. Societies around the world recognize the benefits of collective behavior. The power of multistakeholder partnerships in cybersecurity, too, cannot be ignored as we seek to answer the question, “What we can do to ensure a more safe and secure world for everyone on the planet?”
Individual organizations are often focused on safeguarding their own data and systems and protecting their customers, constituents, and communities.
But partnerships act as a force multiplier for everyone involved in cybersecurity. Collaborative efforts among stakeholders—including government agencies, private sector entities, academia, non‑profits, and other organizations—are crucial in building resilient defenses against cyber threats.
#### The cyber poverty line
To understand the need for collaboration, it is useful to consider the concept of a “cyber poverty line.” In the same way that governments and economists establish a social poverty line to determine a bare minimum standard of living, the cyber poverty line is the minimum level of resources required for adequate protection from cyber threats. As we ponder the implication of the existence of a cyber poverty line, important questions begin to surface. How, exactly, do we quantify the cyber poverty line? Who is below it and how can we work together to support them to rise above it? These questions underscore the imperative of partnership in cybersecurity and serve as the genesis of meaningful conversations we must have.
#### Public-private partnerships, policy, and standards
The opportunities for partnership across the public and private sectors, policy organizations, and standards bodies are multi‑dimensional. From ensuring the technology community is building safer, more secure technology and collaborating on threat intelligence and trends to developing common standards to take down and block the tools cybercriminals use, strong and bi-directional partnerships between organizations are crucial.
As much as any individual company’s shareholders would like it to be so, no one technology company can solve or overcome every cybersecurity challenge. Partnerships across the technology community are an absolute necessity to ensure organizations of all types and sizes, in every industry and region, can protect themselves. This means working together to push the boundaries of innovation, ensuring technical integration of products in the security space and addressing the end‑to‑end security needs of customers.
> The concept of a cyber poverty line allows us to identify the minimum level of resources required for adequate protection from cyber threats and who we must support to rise above it.
#### Non-profit, academia, and research
Non‑profit, academia, and research organizations play a crucial role in advancing cybersecurity. By collaborating with industry partners, they bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Academic institutions contribute to cybersecurity research, develop innovative technologies, and educate the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. Collaborative research projects and initiatives between academia, non‑profits, and industry promote innovation and help tackle emerging cyber threats effectively.
It is essential that stakeholders recognize their shared responsibility and actively engage in partnerships that enhance cybersecurity. History has already shown that by working together, we can build a safer digital future for individuals, organizations and nations—but there is so much more to be done.

### How can we protect against 99% of attacks?
While we explore the many dimensions of the cyber threat landscape, there is one crucial point we must emphasize across them all: the vast majority of successful cyberattacks could be thwarted by implementing a few fundamental security hygiene practices.
By adhering to these minimum-security standards, it is possible to protect against over 99 percent of attacks:
1. **Enable multifactor authentication (MFA):** This protects against compromised user passwords and helps to provide extra resilience for identities.
2. **Apply Zero Trust principles:** The cornerstone of any resilience plan is to limit the impact of an attack on an organization. These principles are:
    - Explicitly verify. Ensure users and devices are in a good state before allowing access to resources.
    - Use least privilege access. Allow only the privilege that is needed for access to a resource and no more.
    - Assume breach. Assume system defenses have been breached and systems may be compromised. This means constantly monitoring the environment for possible attack.
3. **Use extended detection and response (XDR) and antimalware:** Implement software to detect and automatically block attacks and provide insights to the security operations software. Monitoring insights from threat detection systems is essential to being able to respond to threats in a timely fashion.
4. **Keep up to date:** Unpatched and out-of-date systems are a key reason many organizations fall victim to an attack. Ensure all systems are kept up to date including firmware, the operating system, and applications.
5. **Protect data:** Knowing your important data, where it is located, and whether the right defenses are implemented is crucial to implementing the appropriate protection.
Hyperscale cloud makes it easier to implement fundamental security practices by either enabling them by default or abstracting the need for customers to implement them. With software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions, the cloud provider takes responsibility for keeping up with patch management.
Implementing security solutions like MFA or Zero Trust principles is simpler with hyperscale cloud because these capabilities are already built into the platform. Additionally, cloud-enabled capabilities like XDR and MFA are constantly updated with trillions of daily signals, providing dynamic protection that adjusts to the current threat landscape.
#### Fundamentals of cyber hygiene
99%
Basic security hygiene still protects against 99% of attacks.
How effective is MFA at deterring cyberattacks? A recent study based on real‑world attack data from Microsoft Entra found that MFA reduces the risk of compromise by 99.2 percent.[^1]
- Enable multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Apply Zero Trust principles
- Use extended detection and response (XDR) and antimalware
- Keep up to date
- Protect data
Outlier attacks on the bell curve make up just 1%

### Driving global progress through the Cybersecurity Tech Accord
To understand how topics discussed in this report track against the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, please see page 124.
Since its inception, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord has witnessed remarkable progress. As we mark its fifth anniversary, we celebrate a groundbreaking commitment by 156 technology and security companies from around the world to protect our customers from malicious attacks by cybercriminals and nation states.
The Cybersecurity Tech Accord has worked to be the technology industry’s voice on matters of peace and security in cyberspace and to uphold a commitment to protect users and customers everywhere from evolving cyber threats. At the core of this historic initiative are four fundamental cybersecurity principles:
1. **Better defense:** We will protect all of our users and customers everywhere.
2. **No offense:** We will oppose cyberattacks on innocent citizens and enterprises from anywhere.
3. **Capacity building:** We will help empower users, customers, and developers to strengthen cybersecurity protection.
4. **Collective action:** We will partner with each other and likeminded groups to enhance cybersecurity.
The Accord has launched several initiatives, including the Internet of Things (IoT) Security Resource Hub, which aims to establish a strong global baseline for IoT security in the next generation of consumer products. Signatories and industry partners have also embraced a set of principles to combat the menace of cyber mercenaries. The group also engages in extensive consultations with governments, civil society, and private sector partners, advocating for responsible nation-state behavior and amplifying the technology industry’s role in international cybersecurity.
In the past year, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord has made strides in raising awareness of the escalating threats posed by some nation-state actors. In particular, the group launched an Annual State of International Cybersecurity Thermometer, which in 2023 reached a “boiling point,” largely due to the widespread and unprecedented use of cyber operations in the armed conflict in Ukraine.
The Cybersecurity Tech Accord has invested in promoting diversity, particularly empowering women in cybersecurity. Microsoft is proud to work with industry partners and non‑profit organizations worldwide to broaden access and foster the careers of women working in this critical field.

### About this report continued
#### Threat actor descriptions and naming
Throughout this report, we refer to the five key groups that Microsoft uses to characterize threat actors:
- Nation-state actors are cyber operators who act on behalf of, or directed by, a nation/state-aligned program, irrespective of whether the goal is espionage, financial gain, or retribution.
- Financially motivated actors are cyber campaigns/groups directed by a criminal organization/person with the motivation of financial gain which have not been associated with high confidence to a known non‑nation state or commercial entity.
- Cyber mercenaries or private sector offensive actors refer to commercial actors that are known/legitimate legal entities that create and sell cyberweapons to customers who select targets and operate the cyberweapons.
- Influence operations are manipulative information campaigns communicated online or offline that are intended to shift perceptions, behaviors, or decisions by target audiences to further a group or a nation’s interests and objectives.
- Groups in development is a temporary designation given to an unknown, emerging, or developing threat activity. This allows Microsoft to track it as a discrete set of information until we can reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the operation.
#### Threat actor naming taxonomy
In April, we announced that we have shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned to the theme of weather. The complexity, scale, and volume of threats is increasing, driving the need to reimagine not only how Microsoft talks about threats but also how we enable customers to understand those threats quickly and with clarity. With the new taxonomy, we intend to bring better context to customers and security researchers that are already confronted with an overwhelming amount of threat intelligence data. It will offer a more organized, memorable, and easy way to reference adversary groups so that organizations can better prioritize threats and protect themselves. Simply put, security professionals will instantly have an idea of the type of threat actor they are up against, just by reading the name.

#### Other definitions:
- Cyber-enabled influence operations: Operations that combine offensive computer network operations with messaging and amplification in a coordinated and manipulative way to shift perceptions, behaviors, or decisions by target audiences to further a group or nation’s interests and objectives.
- NSN data: This data is based on aggregated nation‑state notifications (NSNs)—notices that we send to customers when they have been targeted or compromised by a nation-state actor that is tracked by Microsoft. Data overwhelmingly reflects activity against Office 365, followed by Outlook and Hotmail. We count NSN data by number of targeted organizations.
- Events data: This data covers a broader range of investigative observations of nation‑state threat actor activity than NSNs. Activity captured in “events” ranges from reconnaissance and movement on network to data exfiltration or deletion.

### The State of Cybercrime
Key developments
Cybercriminals are leveraging the cybercrime-as-a-service ecosystem to launch phishing, identity, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at scale. Simultaneously, they are increasingly bypassing multifactor authentication and other security measures to conduct targeted attacks.
Ransomware operators are shifting heavily toward hands on keyboard attacks, using living-off-the-land techniques and remote encryption to conceal their tracks, and exfiltrating data to add pressure to their ransom demands. And cybercriminals are improving their ability to impersonate or compromise legitimate third parties, making it even harder for users to identify fraud until it’s too late.
- **80-90%** of all successful ransomware compromises originate through unmanaged devices.
- A return on mitigation (ROM) framework is helpful for prioritization and may highlight actions requiring low effort or resources but that have a high impact.
- Password based attacks spiked in 2023
- **70%** of organizations encountering human-operated ransomware had fewer than 500 employees.
- Human-operated ransomware attacks are up more than **200%**
- Last year marked a significant shift in cybercriminal tactics with threat actors exploiting cloud computing resources such as virtual machines to launch DDoS attacks. When hundreds of millions of requests per second originating from tens of thousands of devices constitute an attack, the cloud is our best defense, due to the scale needed to mitigate the largest attacks.

Introduction from Amy Hogan-Burney
While cybercriminals have remained hard at work, we are seeing public and private sectors come together to disrupt the technologies criminals use, hold them to account, and support the victims of cybercrime.
As cybercriminals look for new ways to generate income, they have stayed focused on exploiting weakness in humans and technology, staying ahead of security measures, and coordinating to create sophisticated global networks that sell services. To combat them, public and private sector professionals and organizations are creating strong partnerships that are disrupting criminal’s technology, hold threat actors accountable, and increase resilience to attacks.
As a result, attackers are finding themselves in the crosshairs of law enforcement. Many have been outed, including the Conti ransomware operator known as “Target” whose unmasking includes a $10 million reward for additional information, indicted (Yevgeniy Polyanin) or arrested (Yaroslav Vasinskyi) alleged to have deployed the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware to attack businesses and governments. Governments are also looking beyond criminals to rescue victims, disrupt malicious technology, and seize and return money–as was seen in the case of the Hive ransomware. The private sector is an essential partner in these efforts, whether through criminal referrals and information sharing with law enforcement or through technical and legal action, as seen in Microsoft and Fortra’s action to disrupt cracked, legacy copies of Cobalt Strike and abused Microsoft software.
> Oppose Cyberattacks
The result is that cybercriminals are looking for ways to increase their anonymity and effectiveness. As human-operated ransomware attacks on small and medium businesses increase, we have seen more use of remote monitoring and management tools that leave behind less evidence. Many of these ransomware attacks attempt to compromise or gain access to unmanaged or bring-your-own devices because they typically have fewer security controls and defenses.
Attackers continue to look for the easiest method to gain unauthorized access to any system through identity attacks such as traditional brute-force attempts, sophisticated password spray attempts across multiple countries and IP addresses, and adversary-in-the middle (AiTM) attacks. Phishing is not going away, and attackers are using both malware phishing to compromise devices and AiTM phishing to steal identities that can be used in further criminal activity such as business email compromise.
As you read this report, I encourage you to look for opportunities to improve your defensive security posture, identify areas where you may need investment, and explore ways to make training programs more effective. Consider your opportunities to engage in simulated cyberattacks or tabletop exercises, invest in threat intelligence and actor tracking in the cybercrime space, share information with law enforcement, and take technical or legal disruptive actions. We all have a part to play in fighting cybercrime, and I urge you to consider what more you, your company, or your government could do to help improve cyber resilience.

General Manager, Associate General Counsel, Cybersecurity Policy & Protection

### How the threat landscape is evolving
The cyber threat landscape is continuing to evolve toward more effective and more damaging attacks, which often take place at scale. According to our data, organizations faced an overall increase in ransomware attacks compared to the previous year, while the number of human-operated ransomware attacks almost doubled.
**13%** of human-operated ransomware attacks that moved into the ransom phase included some form of data exfiltration.
This was accompanied by a sharp increase in the use of remote encryption during attacks. Using this method, an attacker encrypts a file on a different computer, and then sends the encrypted file to the original computer. This can happen if one computer on a network is hacked and has access to another computer with the compromised user account(s). No additional software is needed on the original computer, and no harmful files are left behind.
Data extortion is also on the rise. Since November 2022, we observed a doubling of potential data exfiltration instances–the theft or unauthorized removal or movement of data from a device. Thirteen percent of human-operated ransomware attacks that moved into the ransom phase had some form of data exfiltration.
The frequency of business email compromise (BEC) attacks has skyrocketed to over 156,000 daily attempts. Microsoft Entra data shows attempted password attacks increased more than tenfold in 2023, from around 3 billion per month to over 30 billion. This translates to an average of 4,000 blocked attacks per second targeting Microsoft cloud identities.

### What we can learn from attack notifications

For more about identity attacks, see page 34.
For more about ransomware see page 17.
For more about phishing and AiTM, see page 27.
For more about BEC, see page 32.
Managed extended detection and response (XDR) services, such as Microsoft Defender Experts, are invaluable resources for security operations centers to effectively detect and respond to critical incidents.
When we observe novel tactics, techniques, and procedures, human-directed attacks, or attack progression, notifications are sent to our customers to provide specific information regarding the scope, method of entry, and instructions for remediation.
> Protect Users and Customers
Based on the notifications shared with customers, these are the top threats identified by Microsoft Defender Experts this year:
1. **Successful identity attacks:** Attacks across identity included traditional brute-force attempts, sophisticated password spray attempts across multiple countries and IP addresses, and adversary-in-the middle (AiTM) attacks.
2. **Ransomware encounters:** These are defined in this report as any instance of ransomware activity or attempted attacks that we have detected and prevented or alerted on, throughout the various stages of a ransomware attack.
In addition to several ransomware variants this year, we observed a unique large-scale ransomware campaign targeting both endpoints and cloud architecture of an organization. This was driven by the threat actor we named Mango Sandstorm. This campaign included both on-premises and cloud environments, and involved privilege escalation and destruction activities, including deletion of victim user resources, and persistence using OAuth applications. Attackers added a secret or certificate to an application in order to connect to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the application, and perform operations (such as reading confidential data and emails, exfiltrating information through emails) leveraging the application permissions that are assigned to it.
3. **Targeted phishing attempts leading to device or user compromise:** We have observed both malware phishing with intent to compromise devices, and AiTM phishing attempting to steal identities. Defense evasion techniques included phishing from compromised vendors and abuse of legitimate services.
4. **Business email compromise (BEC):** Attackers used various methods including email conversation hijacking and mass spamming with malicious applications to commit financial fraud. They also sent phishing emails with harmful links and attachments from the victim’s email address to other users within the victim’s organization. Since these phishing emails were sent internally, multiple users fell victim to the attack by clicking on the links within a short period of time.

### Insights on ransomware and extortion
New tactics and trends
Microsoft’s telemetry indicates that organizations faced an increased rate of ransomware attacks compared to last year, with the number of human-operated ransomware attacks up more than 200 percent since September 2022.
The good news is, for organizations with a strong security posture, the likelihood of an attack succeeding is very low. Typically, an attack is stopped in the pre-ransom phase, with on average 2 percent of attacks progressing to a successful ransomware deployment.
Approximately 40 percent of the ransomware encounters we detected in June were human-driven. Most of these attacks can be attributed to 123 tracked ransomware-as-a-service affiliates. The number of affiliates grew by 12 percent in the last year, setting up conditions for human-operated ransomware attacks to continue to grow in 2024.
#### Ransomware breaches per month per 100,000 organizations
We observed an overall increase in successful ransomware attacks with a sharp decrease in March-April.
Telemetry sources: Microsoft Security Graph, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Azure AD Identity Protection, Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence
#### Remote encryption
In a notable change from last year, we observed a sharp increase in the use of remote encryption during human-operated ransomware attacks. Instead of deploying malicious files on the victim device, encryption is done remotely, with the system process performing the encryption, which renders process-based remediation ineffective. On average, 60 percent of human-operated ransomware attacks used remote encryption over the past year. This is a sign of attackers evolving to further minimize their footprint.
#### Initial attack vectors
The Microsoft Incident Response team responds to incidents and helps customers secure their most sensitive, critical environments. Based on findings during these engagements, the top three initial access vectors were fairly evenly split, showing criminals are consistently exploiting the same vectors: external remote services, valid accounts, and public facing applications.
We found that among external remote services, adversaries primarily leveraged unsecured remote desktop protocol (RDP) and virtual private networks (VPN). Threat actors attacking valid accounts, where the attacker somehow gained legitimate account credentials, were most often able to log in via Citrix. Among vulnerable external facing applications, cybercriminals exploited vulnerabilities ranging from zero-day vulnerabilities to those that were two to three years old, with Zoho Java ManageEngine, Exchange, MOVEit, and PaperCut print management software among the top applications exploited.
#### Actionable insights
To safeguard against these attacks:
1. It is crucial to implement Zero Trust and least privilege principles.
2. The most efficient solutions are those that can instantly identify attackers by utilizing signals from devices, users, and the entire organization, and take automatic remedial measures across both managed and unmanaged devices.
3. It is essential to have a seamless method to restore encrypted files at the organizational level.

### Ransomware targeting
#### Unmanaged devices
Most human-operated ransomware attacks attempt to compromise or gain access to unmanaged or bring-your-own devices (personal devices used to access work-related systems and information). These typically have fewer security controls and defenses. We have observed that 80 to 90 percent of all compromises originate from unmanaged devices. Ransomware operators are also increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities in less common software, making it more difficult to predict and defend against their attacks. This reinforces the importance of a holistic security approach.
#### Organization size
Despite the notoriety of high-profile attacks last year, the primary victims of ransomware attacks this year were small and medium size organizations. Between July and September 2022, around 70 percent of organizations encountering human-operated ransomware had fewer than 500 employees.
#### Industries
While the critical infrastructure sectors experienced the most ransomware encounters this year, cybercriminals have broadly attacked all sectors. Attackers leveraged new techniques as pre-cursors to ransomware to establish the foothold within the victim organization before exfiltration and ransom. As seen in the distribution of pre-ransom notifications sent by Microsoft Defender Experts to our customers, education and manufacturing sectors were key targets. For example, threat actors targeted a critical remote code execution vulnerability found in PaperCut server, which is used by educational organizations.

### Ransomware variants
Based on data from Microsoft Defender Experts notifications the top four malware variants—Magniber, Lockbit, Hive, and BlackCat—comprised almost two-thirds of ransomware encounters.
Magniber ransomware, which is an automated variant without human operation, has been linked to Storm-0381, which has a track record of using malvertising, the Magnitude exploit kit, and malicious payloads disguised as Windows updates to disseminate Magniber. Magniber was initially used to target countries in Asia in around 2017, but since resurfacing a few years ago it has expanded its reach to global targets.
