Global
Threat
Intelligence
Report

October-December 2023

Q4

INTRODUCTION

Too often, organizations receive threat
intelligence as individual analyses of specific
incidents, giving security teams a narrow
view of the threat landscape. In this Global
Threat Intelligence Report, Mimecast aims
to put the previous three months’ worth of
incidents into context and give companies
the tools they need to understand where
attackers are headed and where defenses
could be improved.

Mimecast generates threat intelligence
through its analysis of 1.7 billion emails
per day on behalf of more than 42,000
customers. Because email is the channel
through which most cyber threats launch,
Mimecast sees many new threats before
they become widely known.

This report distills insights from the
intelligence Mimecast generated
throughout the fourth quarter of
2023 and combines it with external
intelligence from the cybersecurity
community at large. It includes an
analysis of threat activity, a series
of top-line statistics that shaped
that activity, and recommendations
for what small businesses and large
enterprises alike can do to mitigate
the risk those threats pose.

We invite you to explore our Q4
2023 threat intelligence report.
We look forward to sharing more
insights in the future.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

The fourth quarter of 2023
saw attackers continuing to
shift their delivery methods
toward using links for initial
payloads, slowly moving away
from sending malware as email
attachments. In addition, threat
actors are increasingly using QR
codes to get around defenses
designed to block malicious links
and obfuscate their attacks.

Mimecast Threat
Intelligence team

Mimecast’s threat intelligence
team is comprised of a globally
distributed set of engineers,
scientists, analysts, and threat
researchers that aid the
Mimecast Security Operations
Center (MSOC). Threats are
continuously monitored
across more than 1.7 billion
emails per day. Mimecast’s
cybersecurity experts
reverse-engineer attack tools,
investigate attacks, and test
the efficacy of indicators
of compromise to quickly
develop threat intelligence
and protections across its
solutions.

Following attacks on major
casinos earlier in the year,
attackers continued to focus on
travel, hospitality, and catering
companies in Q4 2023, resulting
in the sector becoming the
second most targeted industry
for the quarter, surpassed only
by attackers’ efforts against the
banking sector. While campaigns
directed at human resources
and recruitment services have
subsided somewhat, the sector
remains the third most targeted.

EXTORTION CAMPAIGNS GROW,
CYBERATTACKS FOLLOW GEOPOLITICS

Ransomware and breach-for-ransom campaigns
continued to grow in Q4 2023, with one of the
larger groups, ALPHV Blackcat, compromising more
than 1,000 victims with ransomware and data
extortion and reaping more than $300 million in
ransom payments by the end of the quarter.

Attack strategies have evolved from crypto-
ransomware (where attackers encrypt data and
hold the decryption key) to breach-for-ransom
campaigns (where attackers steal sensitive data and
threaten to release the sensitive information unless
paid) to double- and triple-extortion strategies
(where attackers combine tactics for more direct
consequences).

Ransomware and information-stealing groups have
started using more sophisticated techniques, such
as stealing tokens and account identifiers from
Google Chrome. These successful tactics have led
to a consolidation of the number of ransomware
tools — with 43 malware families used for extortion
in 2023, down from 95 in 2022 — signaling that
cybercriminals and their affiliates are settling
on a known set of popular platforms. Four groups
— LockBit, Cl0p, ALPHV/BlackCat, and Play —
dominated the ransomware landscape during
the quarter, accounting for 88% of all
ransomware activity.

5

However, while ransomware and data-
breach incidents increased in 2023,
companies are resisting extortion
attacks. Ransom payment rates have
plummeted, hitting a low of 34% in Q2
2023, down from 85% at the beginning
of 2019. (The rate that companies
acquiesced to ransom demands ticked
up slightly in Q3 2023.) Three shifts in
business security operations and the
economics of ransomware are likely
driving the change: Companies are less
trusting of cybercriminals’ ability to
recover data; organizations have had
time to (slowly) improve their security
posture; and paying ransoms to threat
actors from certain nation-states now
violates federal laws.

Ransomware groups are aiming to
reverse the trend. Starting on Oct. 1,
the LockBit ransomware group put in
place new rules regarding negotiations
with victims, warning its “affiliates” that
offering large discounts on ransom fees
is no longer acceptable.

The geopolitical situation deteriorated
with the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel
by the militant group Hamas. Like
other global conflicts, such as Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine, cyberattacks have
increased significantly as nation-state
cyber operations, groups linked to
either side, and hacktivist supporters
ramped up their attacks against
web sites, critical infrastructure, and
computer systems. At least 90
pro-Palestinian threat actors and 23
pro-Israeli threat actors conducted
attacks in Q4 2023.

There are already some signs that
machine-learning models and
generative AI are changing the threat
landscape as well. For example,
phishing lures are becoming much more
convincing and easier to tailor to specific
geographies because of the adoption of
generative AI by threat actors, according
to Mimecast’s threat intelligence team.
In addition, researchers have been able
to upload malicious code to GitHub
linked to machine-learning components,
such as PyTorch, like attacks on other
open-source supply chain components.

QUARTER FOUR 2023
IN CHARTS

The sectors that experienced the
most attacks in the fourth quarter
of 2023 were financial institutions;
travel, hospitality, and catering
companies; and human resource
departments. These attacks were
driven by ransomware, data theft,
and BEC.

Additionally, across all industries,
typical users at small and
medium-sized firms encountered
more threats — on average,
twice as many — compared to
users at large companies.

Encounter rates:
SMBs encounter twice
as many threats

The significant uptick in threats seen in Q3 seems
to have subsided, but medium-sized companies still
saw slightly more threats per user (TPU) than smaller
firms in Q4. Average users at small and medium-sized
businesses (SMBs) encountered more than twice the
number of threats — 31 and 32 TPU, respectively —
than users at large companies, who saw about 15
TPU in Q4.

The larger risk for SMBs is due to a greater share of
employees in critical roles; targeting those users results
in a higher level of threats per user. In addition, because
SMBs rely on credential-based cloud services for much
of their operations, attackers are more focused on
credential theft, a common phishing goal.

The fourth quarter of each year tends to see a lower
volume of threats, compared to the preceding quarter,
so the drop in TPU across all organizations is common.

Encounter rates:
malicious links on
the rise

Spam and impersonation both declined in Q4 2023
but continued to dominate malicious activity directed
at users’ email inboxes, with Mimecast defenses
blocking 9.5 and 6.3 emails classified as either spam
or impersonation, respectively, per average user. The
unknown malware category, which Mimecast blocks
based on detecting exploit code in attachments, is too
small to be visible on the first chart.

By removing the two largest categories of threats —
spam and impersonation — another trend becomes
evident. In Q4, for the first time, the average user
was more likely to encounter a malicious link than
a malicious attachment. With users ignoring the
overwhelming volume of email messages blocked as
either spam or impersonation (phishing), attackers are
clearly shifting from delivering payloads as malware to
sending links to malicious sites, which then deliver
the payload.

Industry snapshot: attacks
increase across industries,
while HR-focused attacks
subside

The average number of attacks, excluding spam and
impersonation, fell in Q4 2023, with users in the
formerly most attacked sector — human resources and
recruitment services — encountering 60% fewer threats
than in the previous quarter, causing that sector to drop
to third place in Q4 2023. Meanwhile, the IT software
and software as-a-service sector dropped out of the
top five most targeted sectors, falling all the way to
No. 20 in Q4 2023.

However, the remaining sectors all saw increases in the
most significant threats, which include known malware,
malicious links, and unknown malware, over the prior
quarter. Users in the banking sector continued to
encounter a significant number of attacks, as did users
in the travel, hospitality, and catering industry, which
includes casinos. The average user across all industries
encountered 1.2 threats during the quarter, slightly less
than the average of 1.3 threats per user in Q3 2023.

Vulnerability snapshot:
top vulnerabilities
over time

The total number of vulnerabilities decreased over the
quarter, which is a typical pattern for the fourth quarter
as businesses close and both attackers and victims take
a break at the end of the year.

The top-5 vulnerabilities showed distinct usage patterns.
The most common vulnerability used in malware — a
remote code execution flaw in the Equation Editor in
Microsoft Office 2007 through 2016 (CVE-2018-0802)
— was the workhorse of attackers in Q4 2023. Another
attack exploiting a memory corruption vulnerability in
Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-11882) saw minimal use until
a spike in the third week of November corresponding
with the most popular shopping days of the year.

Only a single vulnerability in the top-5 list — and only
two in the top-10 list — were from 2023, highlighting the
notion that attackers tend to prefer exploiting what they
deem to be the most vulnerable software, even if the
exploited flaw tends to be old.

BRAND ABUSE BECOMES MORE CONVINCING

Almost every type of email attack uses legitimate brands to gain trust and convince users to take actions
that undermine their security, such as parting with sensitive information or clicking on links. During Q4 2023,
for example, one threat actor used SendGrid’s email marketing service to send out email campaigns that
impersonated human resource departments and asked targeted users to click on a link that appeared to be
from a Microsoft SharePoint Online server.

As attackers increasingly use generative AI to create official-sounding notifications and abuse legitimate services
to bypass reputation-focused defenses, brand abuse will only become more problematic.

14

Attackers use different brands depending on context

The perennial impersonated brand is Microsoft, as data
from our Q3 2023 report demonstrated. However, specific
events may result in attackers using other brands to attempt
to gain trust. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic,
for example, Amazon, Apple, and the Social Security
Administration were the top-three most impersonated
brands.

In Q4, attackers again switched up their brand-
impersonation tactics. Looking to capitalize on the holiday
shopping season, fraudsters ramped up their impersonation
of Amazon, leading to a spike of spam and phishing
detections for the brand. During the two weeks before Black
Friday, considered to be the start of the holiday shopping
season in the United States, Mimecast detected more
Amazon-branded threats than Microsoft-branded threats.

Meanwhile, attackers are using QR codes to obfuscate the
destination of a link, while also relying on branding to convince
users that QR codes are from official sources. This has moved
from a niche attach methodology to mainstream as seen
with emails that contain QR codes exceeding 3.5 million per
day regularly (see figure 7). Mimecast has documented two
major campaigns using QR codes — one branded as Microsoft
password reset and the other as DocuSign.

File-share abuse is
about brands

Attackers increasingly are using links
rather than attachments for payloads
— whether the payload is a phishing
site for stealing credentials or malware
for the victim to download. To escape
detection by security solutions and
garner users’ trust, attackers are
widely using file-sharing sites that have
trusted brands to serve up malicious
content (see figure 8).

The top brand for file-sharing sites
for the past three quarters is the
notetaking and sharing service
Evernote. Microsoft SharePoint comes
in a distant second, while ShareFile
managed storage service follows in
third place.

THREAT
ASSESSMENT

Attackers have doubled down on techniques for bypassing
multifactor authentication (MFA) mechanisms. EvilProxy,
a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform, targeted the
financial and insurance industries with an attack that uses
a proxy to bypass MFA, while another group used the
DadSec PhaaS platform to send victims to a proxy that
acts as an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) to capture MFA
requests and compromise victims’ Microsoft 365 accounts.

Ransomware operators
have continued to
increase their focus on
energy companies in Q4.
Initial access brokers
(IABs) actively sought
out credentials and
compromised systems
within the networks of
energy operators.

Nation-state cyber conflicts
heated up following the
terrorist attack by Hamas
on Israeli civilians and
Israel’s military response
and invasion of Gaza. Added
to the online operations
that continue as part
of the Russian-Ukraine
conflict, state-sponsored
cyberattacks have become
more common.

TOP THREAT CAMPAIGNS Q4

Each quarter, we select a
subset of the threats to analyze
in this report. Some campaigns
have significant volume, which
is apparent from the sparklines
(see below) showing the
number of threats detected
during the quarter, while
others show interesting attack
techniques or targeting.

Microsoft QR codes

Since the pandemic, QR codes have become extremely popular, and

Mimecast regularly blocks campaigns using the next-generation

barcode to obfuscate links. Consumers and workers are increasingly

becoming accustomed to QR codes, whether to access a digital menu

at a restaurant, collect details about an event, or install new software

at the click of a link. As a result, users’ suspicion of obfuscated links

has declined, making them more likely to scan the codes bypassing

organizational security.

During Q4, Mimecast encountered a phishing attempt that impersonates
a company requesting that the targeted victim set up Microsoft

authentication. Because the content of the email is an image — and there

is nothing for the user to click on — many security solutions will not catch

the attack. When scanned, the link behind the QR code will send the user

to a page that attempts to phish their Microsoft Office 365 credentials.

DocuSign QR codes

Google App Script attacks

ADVISORIES

Government sources issued
many advisories focused on
enterprise security during
the quarter, including
warnings of the continued
use of spear phishing by the
Russian threat actor Star
Blizzard and the increased
use of insecure third parties
to compromise targets.
In addition, the NSA and
CISA compiled a list of ten
common cybersecurity
misconfigurations that could
lead to a breach.

7 Dec [NCSC/NSA/FBI/CISA/ACSC/CCCS] Russian FSB Cyber Actor Star Blizzard Continues Worldwide
Spear-Phishing Campaigns

The Russia-linked group Star Blizzard has targeted a wide variety of organizations with spear-phishing attacks

based on well-researched lures and social and professional contacts, with the end result typically the delivery of a

malicious link. The group appears to mainly target organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom, but

campaigns have also targeted organizations in NATO countries and nations neighboring Russia.

19 Dec [CISA/FBI] #StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat

The FBI and CISA released a joint advisory describing the indicators of compromise (IoCs) for the latest ransomware

released by the ALPHV/BlackCat group, ALPHV Blackcat Ransomware 2.0 Sphynx. As of September 2023, the group

had compromised over 1,000 entities, of which three-quarters are in the United States and collected nearly $300

million in ransom payments.

HOW TO TAKE
ACTION

Cybercriminals and threat actors
commonly target privileged roles,
unpatched vulnerabilities, and
insecure supply chains and third
parties. Organizations should
take steps to protect the most
privileged users and find ways to
slow down attackers.

Threat-specific countermeasures

Threat-specific countermeasures
Protect sensitive positions
Attackers are broadly hitting specific business roles, therefore
organizations should segment certain personnel from potentially
malicious content, such as executables and scripts within
documents. For example, Salespeople and executives shouldn’t
receive or execute code, while IT administrators should be
monitored using anomalous behavior detection.

Slow down attackers using segmentation and deception
Some attackers — specifically ransomware groups, such as Cl0p
— are developing their own zero-day exploits to target previously
unknown vulnerabilities. Network segmentation can cordon off
sensitive parts of the network from attackers, while deceptive
techniques, such as honeytokens, can both slow the attackers and
alert defenders.

Develop a secure supply chain strategy
Attackers are increasingly targeting third parties and professional
services as alternative pathways into targeted networks.
Organizations should create minimum security requirements for
their partners and service providers and find ways to measure
compliance. It is also recommended that transactions be made
through dedicated or authenticated systems, which builds user
suspicion when requests for payment come in via email.

Educate users and block malicious QR codes
QR codes have taken off as attackers look to obfuscate their use of
images to sneak links into spam, phishing, and other email-based
attacks. In addition to preventing the loading of images by default*,
organizations should educate their workers on the dangers posed
by QR codes. Mimecast provides the ability to determine whether a
QR code leads to malicious payload and block those that do.

Note: CyberGraph users should leverage trusted sites to ensure banners load correctly.

Make credentials resistant to phishing
Our data (see Figure 3) shows that phishing is the second most
common attack type after spam, with attackers typically using
the email attack to steal credentials from users. For that reason,
organizations should focus on minimizing the impact of a successful
phishing attack. Adopting an additional factor of authentication,
especially phishing-resistant technology, can result in a significant
reduction in credential-based attacks as part of a zero-trust
approach to security. Organizations that add pervasive multifactor
authentication to both their cloud and internal infrastructure will
reduce their risk by an order of magnitude.

General recommendations to combat threat

Assess your attack surface areas
With many organizations moving to cloud services, the overall
attack surface has grown. Companies should embrace a zero-trust
approach to workers’ access to company resources, requiring
reauthentication when necessary and main strict visibility into
all assets.

Minimize your attack surface by blocking unused services
If an organization doesn’t use or expect to use certain web
content hosts and websites, they should be blocked. For example,
if Dropbox is not a corporate standard, it shouldn’t be allowed.
Similarly, if Excel documents should not be sent in email, controls
must be put in place to prevent such actions.

Prioritize vulnerabilities for patching
Attackers continue to shrink the time between the disclosure of a
vulnerability and the release of exploits and attacks targeting the
identified security issues. The list of known exploited vulnerabilities
(KEVs) maintained by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) grew to 1,053 software flaws by the end of
Q4 2023, but patching every issue in the KEV catalog isn’t enough.
Organizations should use different vulnerability metrics and their
knowledge of critical systems to prioritize patching.

Steps specific to Mimecast customers

•

It is recommended to utilize single sign-on from your
identity provider or leverage Mimecast’s built in multi-factor
authentication to reduce an attacker’s ability to leverage email
as their attack vector. LEARN MORE

•  Ensure DNS authentication policies honor DMARC records.
A second policy scoped to a policy group with the DMARC
Fail action set to Ignore/Managed and Permitted Senders
will provide an effective bypass for any legitimate mail being
rejected/quarantined for DMARC failures. LEARN MORE

•  Optimize Impersonation Protection as per best practice

guidelines of 2 hits set to tag Subject/Body and include a
separate C-Level/VIP policy based on name match with a hold
for admin review. In addition, create another policy for any
detections of 3 hits or more with the admin hold action.
LEARN MORE

•  Setting an aggressive re-writing of URLs will ensure all URLs are
scanned upon click but be aware that anything that looks like
a URL will be re-written e.g., IP addresses and internal links.
LEARN MORE

•  Consider setting Auto-Allow policies to ‘strict’ instead of

‘allow’ to ensure that spam scanning is not bypassed at an
organizational level for external email recipients. This should
be set in conjunction with ‘Auto Allow Spam Detection’ to hold
for review to ensure no potentially malicious messages bypass
scanning. LEARN MORE

•  Utilize pre-built integrations with the majority of SIEM and

XDR vendors to provide log capture and analysis for security
policy enforcement. LEARN MORE

•  Leverage bring-your-own threat intelligence to take advantage
of any third-party threat feeds for automatic rejection of
matching indicators. LEARN MORE

•

It is recommended to deploy end user tools to report potentially
malicious messages to Mimecast SOC for additional analysis.
LEARN MORE

If you are unsure of the effect of any of the proposed
settings, please reach out to your Mimecast account
manager, customer success manager or log a call with
Mimecast support.

RESOURCESS

CONCLUSION

The fourth quarter of 2023 solidified many of
the trends from previous quarters. Attackers
are increasingly using brands to fool users
into trusting spam and phishing attacks, often
marrying the brand with a QR code or a link to a
legitimate file service. Geopolitical tensions have
heated up following Hamas’ attack on Israeli
civilians and Israel’s subsequent retaliation,
resulting in more attacks related to the conflict
and a new set of topics for phishing lures.

Attackers slightly changed the sectors they
targeted in Q4 2023, focusing on finance, such as
banking and other services; professional services,
such as HR and accounting; and the travel,
hospitality, and catering sector. While campaigns
targeting the human resources and recruitment
services sector have subsided somewhat, the
industry remains the third most targeted sector.

Here is a list of government resources (webinars,
papers, advisories) that security groups can visit to
better understand the threats and defenses.
