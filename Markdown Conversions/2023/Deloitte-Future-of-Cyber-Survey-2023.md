# of Cyber Survey

Building long-term value by putting
cyber at the heart of the business

# The answer is cyber

Today, we are seeing the emergence of powerful new attitudes
when it comes to cyber. Leaders are looking at cyber through
a sharp, new lens—one that reveals the inherent business
value that can come by embedding cyber. Not only across the
enterprise, but as a crucial part of a powerful growth strategy.

No longer just an obligation or a collection of tech-
focused hygiene practices, cyber has grown into
a critical function for helping businesses deliver
outcomes, and the results of Deloitte’s 2023 Future
of Cyber Survey illuminate this. This year’s global
survey—Deloitte’s largest cyber survey to date—
polled leaders across industries in order to get a
clearer picture of where cyber stands and where it is
going. What we discovered is that cyber’s profile as an
enabler is growing. Among organizations of all sizes,
cyber is consistently earning a place on the agenda,
becoming a focal point for business-critical initiatives
and investment.

We are excited about the future of cyber, and I
invite you to join us in exploring some of the key
findings in this report. In addition to data derived
from the survey results, the report also includes
observations and insights taken directly from
survey respondents, as well as additional Deloitte
insights on cyber, cloud, and other technologies
enabling the future of business.

Stay well,

Emily Mossburg,
Deloitte Global Cyber Leader

# VIEW FROM THE TOP

## Cyber beyond

Building long-term value by putting cyber at the heart of the business

The future of cyber is coming into sharper focus as
organizations worldwide begin to look beyond the
tech-centric and threat focus toward the potential
positive outcomes they can achieve by deeply
integrating cyber thinking and cyber actions across
their businesses.

The world is increasingly interconnected, bringing
about new risks alongside the new growth
opportunities. Digital technologies, exponential
growth of data, and evolving business needs are
expanding attack threat surfaces and bringing new
challenges that elevate cyber as a strategic business
issue. Collaboration across cyber, risk management,
and business units is critical to neutralizing
cyberthreats, protecting business value, and
sustaining customer trust.

In recent years, many enterprise leaders were
focusing on the continued transition to digital
business processes, as well as their technology
environments and the rapid evolution of the cyber
threat landscape. In fact, managing hybrid IT and
digital transformation have emerged as two of the
greatest challenges businesses face—solidifying
complexity as the new norm for the enterprise.[^1]

Today, a new reality is taking shape, based on Deloitte’s
2023 Global Future of Cyber Survey, which asked
hundreds of leaders across industries and across the
globe to share their views on cyber threats, enterprise
activities, and the future. The survey included C-suite
executives across the enterprise, as well as other senior
leaders with responsibility for IT, security, and risk. This
new reality is grounded by the following findings.

Cyber is evolving into a distinct functional area of the
business, transcending its traditional IT roots and
becoming an essential part of the framework for
delivering business outcomes.

### Relationship transformation
> “ We’re starting to see a far more significant focus
> on cybersecurity as an enterprise business risk.
> Across the organization, there is a significant shift
> in partnership in viewing cybersecurity as a core
> ingredient of our transformation and not a side
> garnish or afterthought. We’re doing a lot in terms
> of embedding cyber—whether it’s DevSecOps or
> in product development—where we’re starting
> to co-create with the (internal) partners to make
> sure that we’re building things securely. It’s like
> cultural transformation.”

—Allan Cockriel, Group CIO/CISO, Shell

Organizations increasingly recognize
the role cyber plays in enabling
broad business success.

Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, cyber is
growing far beyond its technology roots. For many
organizations, cyber now weaves more tightly into
business operations, outcomes, and opportunities.
Cyber is more than technology-focused. It is
foundational. Among cyber decision-makers across
an organization, it has become part of the structure
of the business, an embedded element for supporting
business ambitions.

Just as cyber threats shifted from an IT problem to a
business problem, we also now see a shift in cyber
strategies from IT to the business—ultimately to
support strategic business objectives and growth.
Cyber as a business priority is becoming more
evident at the board level. In this year’s survey, 70%
of respondents reported that cyber was on their

board’s agenda on a regular basis, either monthly or
quarterly. This clearly demonstrates that cyber has
earned an important seat at the table where high-
level, strategic business decisions are made.

Organizations increasingly recognize the role cyber
plays in enabling broad business success.

An overwhelming majority of survey respondents
identified a strong connection between cyber and
business impact—with 86% reporting that cyber
initiatives made a significant, positive contribution
on at least one key business priority. And most
organizations are looking to build on that value
proposition, with 58% planning to increase their
cyber investment in the next year.

Despite cyber’s potential as a business enabler,
the ability to leverage it effectively can be
inconsistent across organizations. Some
organizations have emerged as clear leaders,
defining a path to value for others to follow.

Despite cyber’s potential as a business enabler, the
ability to leverage it effectively can be inconsistent
across organizations. Some organizations
have emerged as clear leaders, defining a path to value
for others to follow.

As part of this year’s survey, Deloitte identified high-
performing, cyber-mature organizations based on
their level of cyber planning, their engagement on
cyber at the board level, and the level of strategic
action they have taken on cyber. These organizations
are fully implementing actions that are important for
cyber hygiene, including: an operational and strategic
plan, an action plan to continuously improve the
organization’s information security, and a cyber risk
program to monitor and track the security posture of
partners and suppliers.

These organizations, especially, are making the
connection between cyber efforts and business value.
They are more likely to report that cyber initiatives
made a positive impact to a large extent on:

*   Brand reputation
*   Customer and digital trust
*   Operational stability, including the supply chain
    and partner ecosystem
*   Revenue

Organizations with high cyber maturity also are
more likely to report that cyber brings value to key
business strategies—providing the organization with
confidence to try new things, increasing business
agility, and enabling efficiency. And they are more
likely to report seeing very high value from the third-
party cyber services that they engage.

### Moving the business forward

# METHODOLOGY

## How we developed the insights

Deloitte designed its 2023 Global Future of Cyber
Survey based on the complexity of today’s business
and technology landscape, focusing on the needs
of enterprise leaders who may recognize the
importance of cyber yet struggle to harness its value.
Deloitte based its research on a survey of more than
1,000 cyber decision-makers at the director level or
higher (C-suite executives and C-suite direct reports),
across 20 countries and limited to organizations
with at least 1,000 employees and US$500 million in
annual revenue.

To accurately capture the increased impact that
cyber has on businesses today, we nearly doubled
the sample size from the 2021 research, from almost
600 respondents to 1,110. Deloitte also conducted
in-depth interviews with a number of senior cyber
decision-makers across various industries and

geographies, to glean more detailed insights and
to help validate our observations. Our approach
covered every aspect relevant to the future of cyber,
from strategy to tactics to culture to technology
implementation.

At the core of this research, we focused our
intentions and efforts on:

*   Exploring how cyber has changed since Deloitte’s
    2021 report
*   Applying a forward-thinking lens, to help bring the
    future of cyber into sharper focus
*   Understanding the business value and impact of
    cyber that organizations are experiencing, and the
    distinct actions leading organizations are taking to
    gain more value from cyber

### Headquarters locations of the organizations we surveyed

*   35% Americas (North America, South America)
*   25% APAC (Asia Pacific)
*   40% EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa)

# THE IMPERATIVE

## The future is cyber

In addition to providing essential context for how cyber has evolved
over the past two years, we developed a view on cyber maturity to
understand the business impact that leading organizations make
when they adopt more mature cyber strategies.

By separating high-cyber-maturity organizations
from their medium- and low-cyber-maturity
counterparts, we can identify a distinct class of
cyber leaders and more fully understand the
extent to which cyber underpins business success
and value.

Put another way, cyber should be embedded across
the broader business strategy. It should be included
in every functional area, as an essential ingredient
for success—to drive continuous business value, not
simply mitigate risks to IT.

Today, cyber means business, and it is difficult to
overstate the importance of cyber as a foundational
and integral business imperative. For any enterprise,
the future of cyber will be shaped by the C-suite and
the board’s commitment, and by the business value
that the entire organization can envision with cyber.
Altogether, the results of our research show a new
dynamic emerging as the CISO and the rest of the
C-suite, along with the board, work in partnership to
lead the business and enable innovation—together.

### Demonstrating impact
> “ Where we minimize risk, we can clearly articulate
> where and how we have made an impact and how
> we’ve allowed operations to continue in a smooth
> and effective way—especially relative to our
> business partners that in many cases have had
> either operational or integration challenges.”

—CISO, Consumer Organization

# HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

## Looking at how the
landscape has evolved

Since our previous report in the last quarter of 2021, global
industries have continued to navigate constant disruption on
multiple fronts, while adjusting their priorities, business initiatives,
and capabilities accordingly.

Both the 2021 survey and this latest survey asked
respondents about their organizations’ digital
transformation priorities—to help identify which
technologies were important to the organization
and would, therefore, need to be considered as
part of future cyber strategies.

Compared to companies’ top two priorities in 2021,
cloud moved from the #2 spot to the #1 spot,
displacing data analytics. Operational technology/
industrial control systems and artificial intelligence/
cognitive computing remained in the top five, moving
up slightly. Joining the top-5 list this year is newcomer
5G, reflecting the growing role of the standard in
organizations’ business ambitions.

The continued importance of cloud brings with it the
complex cyber considerations that are inherent in
hosting data and applications off premises and often
across various environments. While cloud—and cyber
cloud—maturity varies considerably, findings in our
recent Future of Cloud Survey suggest that many
organizations are overcoming those concerns and
achieving highly positive outcomes for risk-related
cloud use cases. In fact, 83% of organizations say their
cloud investments are driving positive outcomes in
terms of mitigating business and regulatory risk.[^2] This
is a positive signal regarding maturing cyber cloud
capabilities, shared responsibility models, and data
privacy programs being put into place.

# THEN AND NOW

## The role of cyber

As part of our latest Global Future of Cyber survey,
we asked about the role that cyber plays in each
of these leading digital transformation initiatives.
The results are clear: executives see cyber playing a
crucial role for all digital transformation priorities,
especially when it comes to cloud, data analytics,
and 5G (Figure 1).

While digital priorities and emerging technologies have
evolved, so too have the effects of cyber incidents on
organizations we analyzed. Even as the organization’s
focus shifts to the positive benefits and long-term
business value that cyber readiness can bring, it
is important to keep sight of cyber’s core ability to
counter cyber threats, mitigating negative business
consequences and risks.

### At the top

—CISO, Financial Services Organization

![Figure 1: Cyber in the spotlight](Image description: A bar chart showing the percentage of executives who see cyber playing a leading role in various digital transformation initiatives. The initiatives include Cloud, Data analytics, 5G, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence/cognitive computing, Operational Technology/Industrial Control Systems, New/Upgrade ERP Program, and others. The chart shows that Cloud has the highest percentage, followed by Data Analytics and 5G. The bars are segmented to show the extent to which cyber plays a role: Not at all, To a small extent, To a medium extent, To a large extent.)

### Insights on incidents and impact

The frequency of cyber incidents or breaches has
been growing, with 91% of organizations reporting
at least one, compared to 88% in the 2021 survey. A
multitude of actors, sources, tools, and techniques
are part of the cyber concerns for organizations.
High-maturity organizations seem more concerned
about cyber criminals and terrorists, as well as
phishing, malware, and ransomware attacks. Low- and
medium-maturity companies have greater concern
about denial-of-service attacks. It is worth noting that
organizations with low maturity report experiencing
more significant cybersecurity events (Figure 2).

91%
Organizations reporting
at least one cyber
incident or breach.

![Figure 2: Number of significant cybersecurity events](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the number of significant cybersecurity events experienced by organizations with low, medium, and high cyber maturity. The categories for events are 1-5 events, 6-10 events, 11-15 events, 16 or above, and None. The chart indicates that low cyber maturity organizations experience a higher number of significant events compared to medium and high maturity organizations.)

Meanwhile, operational disruption continues to be the
most significant impact of cyber incidents, although
loss of revenue and loss of customer trust jumped in
the rankings—to second and third place—with 56%
of respondents reporting that they suffered related
consequences to a moderate or large extent. One
potential hypothesis in play here: Organizations with a
higher level of maturity may view the impacts differently,
as they have a deeper understanding of what is actually
happening in their business. Less mature organizations
may be evaluating theoretical impacts. Regardless,
high-maturity organizations do appear to be reaping
significantly more positive benefits from cyber
initiatives—including improved brand reputation and
trust, operational benefits, and financial benefits. Low-
and medium-maturity groups seem more likely to gain
benefits around brand reputation and improving trust,
as opposed to other areas.

In the context of these significant impacts, the need for
a risk-based cyber strategy—across the organization’s
ecosystem of cyber strategies, solutions, and controls—
is ever more important for the future of cyber. A zero
trust architecture can enable modern enterprise
environments by strengthening security posture,
simplifying security management, and improving end-
user experience. And the journey to zero trust requires
a strategy aligned to business outcomes plus significant
effort and planning, including addressing foundational
cyber issues, automating manual processes, and
planning for transformational changes to the security
organization, the technology landscape, and the
enterprise itself.[^3]

### More than zero
A zero trust implementation is much more than a technological
implementation, it is also a business and cultural transformation that
is dependent on culture, communications, and awareness.

*   A comprehensive zero trust implementation should address a
    number of elements, including governance (architecture and
    operations), enablers such as analytics and automation, and core
    domains such as identities, data, and devices.

![Figure 3: Feeling the pain](Image description: A table showing the negative consequences resulting from cyber incidents and breaches, ranked by their importance in 2021 and 2023. The consequences include Operational disruption, Loss of revenue, Loss of customer trust/negative brand impact, Reputational loss, and others. The table also shows the percentage of respondents reporting these consequences to a moderate or large extent in 2023.)

# WHY MATURITY MATTERS

## Understanding
what it means to
be cyber mature

In today’s environment of heightened cyber
importance, we drew from our experience
working with thousands of organizations
worldwide to segment respondents
according to their cyber maturity.

### Defining maturity

To define cyber maturity and identify the high performers who are shaping the future of cyber, we used three
sets of leading practices to rate organizations:

*   **Robust cyber planning**,
    indicated by the presence of
    strategic, operational, and tactical
    plans to defend against and
    respond to cyber threats
*   **Key cyber activities**, such as
    qualitative and quantitative
    risk assessment, incident-
    response scenario planning
*   **Effective board engagement**,
    exemplified by organizations
    whose boards address cyber-
    related issues on a regular basis

### A closer look at maturity groups

By assigning point values to each set of leading practices, we were able to segment the surveyed organizations
into three groups:

*   **38%** Low cyber maturity
    organizations, adhering
    to none of the sets
    of leading practices
*   **41%** Medium cyber
    maturity organizations,
    adhering to 1 of the sets
    of leading practices
*   **21%** High cyber maturity
    organizations,
    adhering to 2–3 sets
    of leading practices

### Maturity at any size,
in any industry

In looking across the three
groups, we dug into their broader
characteristics to identify any
trends or traits for maturity.
All three of the segments (low,
medium, high) spanned industries
as well as organization size and
revenue—indicating that maturity
level may not be significantly
dependent on a company’s
industry or size.

## Connecting maturity to value,
for the entire enterprise

Crucially, the three leading practices that we identified—cyber
planning, activities, and board involvement—hinge on stakeholders
recognizing the importance of cyber responsibility and engagement
across the whole organization.

While CISOs can serve as organizational
champions for cyber, many of these leading
practices only become possible through
enterprisewide engagement.

That can take the form of:

*   Having a governing body that comprises
    IT and senior business leaders to oversee the
    cyber program
*   Conducting incident-response scenario planning and
    simulation at the organizational and/or board level
*   Regularly providing cyber updates to the board,
    to secure funding
*   Annual cyber awareness training among
    all employees

The high-maturity organizations that we identified
recognize the effectiveness of distributing cyber
responsibilities throughout the organization. Such
efforts align with Deloitte’s common guidance of
embedding cyber professionals within business
units, or at least having someone in each business
unit with a clear responsibility for coordinating
with the cyber team. They are 31% less likely to cite
inadequate governance across their organization as
a top challenge in managing cyber (35% for low cyber
maturity vs. 34% for medium cyber maturity vs. 22%
for high cyber maturity).

![Figure 4: Where industries stand](Image description: A visual representation showing the cyber activities and planning strategies implemented by different industries (Energy, Resources & Industrials; Government & Public Services; Technology, Media & Telecom; Financial Services; Consumer; Life Sciences & Health Care). The chart uses color coding to indicate whether industries are slightly ahead, slightly behind, or behind the overall average in implementing these strategies and activities. It also provides examples of cyber planning strategies and cyber activities.)

### Organization size
The research also indicated that companies with
20,000 or more employees are more likely to:

*   Understand the importance of business strategies
    around risk management, digital transformation,
    digital trust, and technology modernization.
*   Recognize the importance of cyber in these
    business strategies.
*   Engage in cyber planning and implementing key
    cyber activities.

Meanwhile, the financial services industry is
implementing four out of eight cyber planning strategies
at levels slightly higher than the overall average. That
industry, however, is behind the overall average when
it comes to cyber activities, with only one activity rising
above the overall average.

And our data showed that the consumer industry is
slightly behind other industries and the overall average,
with seven out of the ten key cyber activities, slightly
behind the overall average, and with all of the cyber
planning strategies being implemented at levels below
the overall average.

The bottom line
Any organization, regardless of industry or size, can
move toward high cyber performance and maturity.
Success should not depend solely on your ability
to “buy” maturity through increased investments in
cyber. Rather, the actions that you take and the culture
that you build will be primary factors for improving
performance.

The survey defined small
companies as those with
revenue of US$500 million to
US$1 billion. Large companies
included organizations with
US$10 billion or more in revenue.

## Bolstering the business with cyber

### Building a bigger business case for cyber
Regardless of an organization’s maturity, there is no
cyber architecture or approach that can guarantee
absolute security and risk mitigation. Instead, the most
striking feature of highly cyber-mature organizations
is their ability to extract value from their cyber
investments.

High performers are doing more when it comes to
engaging leadership, planning, and acting—and it
appears to be generating more business value from
their cyber efforts. In terms of seeing impacts like
increased efficiency, resiliency, and agility, those highly
mature organizations are ahead of the pack, and they
are recognizing benefits that may not be typically
associated with cyber.

### Generating confidence and much more

More than half of these leaders (55%) reported that
cyber provides them with confidence to try new
things—compared to 45% for medium-maturity
organizations and 40% for low-maturity organizations.

And nearly 70% of highly mature organizations said
cyber was making an impact on both enhancing trust
and enabling efficiency—significantly higher than the
low- and medium-maturity organizations.

Likewise, a majority of highly mature leaders (65%) also
cited resilience and agility as benefits of cyber—once
again far ahead of their low-maturity and medium-
maturity peers (Figure 5).

![Figure 5: Recognizing the bigger potential](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the impact of cyber on business initiatives across different maturity levels (Low, Medium, High). The impacts include Enhanced trust, Enabling efficiency, Detected potential, Improved resilience, Increased agility, Preventing bad things from happening, Providing confidence to try new things. The chart shows that high-maturity organizations report higher positive impacts across most categories.)

### Customer expectations
> “ The customer—my personal guess—is not
> willing to pay a lot extra for cybersecurity (in our
> products). They will expect to have it. It will be a
> differentiator.”

—CISO, Automotive Organization

![Figure 6: Reaping real benefits](Image description: A stacked bar chart illustrating the positive contributions of cyber initiatives across different maturity levels (Low, Medium, High). The contributions are categorized as Improved customer trust and brand impact, Improved tech integrity confidence, Improved brand reputation, Improved digital trust, Increased talent recruitment/retention, Long-term sustainability, Operational stability, Increased resilience, Increased agility, Realized potential, Increased revenue, Increased funding, and others. The chart shows that high-maturity organizations report more significant positive contributions across most areas.)

Building customer trust affects
partners and improves market
capitalization, with trusted
companies ultimately
outperforming their peers.

One other area in which highly mature cyber
organizations exceeded their peers in the low and
medium group: the value they are seeing from using
third-party cyber services.

A majority of these high performers reported
measurable value when it came to third-party services
for cyber strategy, data protection and privacy, cyber

cloud, infrastructure security, and application security.
Meanwhile, a minority of low- and medium-maturity
companies reported value across those areas.

Importantly, to take advantage of the value that third-
party cyber services can bring, organizations should
consider ways they can manage their growing services
ecosystem and the inherent complexity (Figure 7).

![Figure 7: Getting value with vendors](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing where companies are reporting value from third-party cyber services across different maturity levels (Low, Medium, High). The services include Cyber strategy, Data protection and privacy, Cyber cloud, Infrastructure security, Application security, Emerging technologies, Identity and access management, Detect and respond, and Recover and transform. The chart indicates that high-maturity organizations report higher value from these services across most categories.)

### Lessons to learn:
Following the leaders

Given the ability of these high-performing organizations to extract
significant business wide benefits from their cyber investments, other
organizations should look to the example set by cyber-mature companies—
using it as a set of guideposts for achieving broader enterprise engagement
on cyber.

Based on the success that these high-maturity organizations have derived
from cyber, it may be time for your business to take a deeper dive into
questions such as:

*   Do we have the right
    technology and
    partner ecosystem in
    place—and how can
    we manage a growing,
    complex network of
    third parties?
*   Are we investing in
    the right ways and in
    the right areas—and
    do we have the right
    framework in place to
    understand how and
    where cyber is adding
    value across the
    organization?
*   Are we investing in
    the right ways and in
    the right areas—and
    do we have the right
    “value frame” in place
    to understand how and
    where cyber is adding
    value across the
    organization?

# KEY INSIGHTS

## Key insights to shape the future of cyber: Five areas of focus

### 1. Multidirectional engagement

As we have already noted, high-performing
organizations engage the entire organization in cyber
activities. While high-maturity organizations, by
definition, leverage more cyber leading practices than
their medium- and low-maturity counterparts, the
disparities in organizational engagement are among
the starkest.

*   **Leadership.** High-maturity organizations are nearly
    three times as likely as low-maturity organizations, and
    nearly twice as likely as medium-maturity organizations,
    to have a governing body comprising senior business
    and IT leaders, to oversee their cyber programs (60%
    high vs. 36% medium, 22% low).
*   **Scenario planning.** Similarly, high-maturity
    organizations are three times as likely as low-maturity
    organizations, and twice as likely as medium-maturity
    organizations, to conduct incident-response scenario
    planning at the organizational and/or board level (60%
    high vs. 30% medium, 20% low).

### 2. Criticality to digital transformation initiatives

High-maturity organizations are much more likely to
value cyber as central to key digital transformation
priorities (Figure 8).

Adoption of these digital transformation priorities is
essential to ensuring operational agility and business
success. But each carries significant cyber risks, and
high-maturity organizations may be especially attuned
to that reality.

For example, AI can be an enabler of cyber strategies
and companies’ digital business ambitions, but it
also introduces the potential for cyber risk that can
come with any digital technology. Beyond the leading
practices we have highlighted here, our recent State
of AI in the Enterprise survey report also underscores
how engaging in specific risk-mitigation steps can also
help drive better outcomes, such as cost reduction
and entry into new markets. AI-related risks represent
an issue of high importance to organizations. It also
found explainability and transparency in AI decisions,
data privacy or consent mismanagement, and safety
concerns about AI systems, among others, all loom
large as ethical risks that concern organizations.[^5]

Managing these risks can have a major impact on
an organization’s AI efforts. In fact, the AI survey
found that 50% of respondents cited management
of AI-related risks as one of the top inhibitors to
scaling AI projects. Despite such sentiments, only
33% of respondents have aligned their AI risk
management with their organization’s broader risk
management efforts. However, 33% of high-outcome
surveyed organizations and 29% of low-outcome
surveyed organizations do engage outside vendors to
independently audit their AI systems.

The initiatives include Cloud, Data analytics, 5G, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence/cognitive computing. The chart shows that high-maturity organizations consistently rate cyber as more important across all initiatives compared to medium and low-maturity organizations.)

### 3. Robust planning

Planning is proving to be paramount for creating
cyber strategies that effectively mitigate risk and
drive business value. And the high-performing
organizations identified in this report appear to be
abundantly aware of planning’s importance (Figure 9).

Highly cyber-mature organizations are more likely to
have robust plans in place, with elements that may
include:

*   A cybersecurity incident-response plan that
    gets updated and tested annually (87% of high-
    maturity organizations)
*   An operational and strategic plan to defend

    against cyber threats (91%)
*   A comprehensive plan to assess how it

    protects data in each step, covering where that
    data is stored, processed, and transmitted (88%)

91%
High-maturity
organizations an
operational and
strategic plan to
defend against
cyber threats.

The actions include having an operational and strategic plan, annual cybersecurity awareness training, an incident response plan, a comprehensive data protection plan, a cyber risk program, an action plan for continuous improvement, purchasing cybersecurity insurance, and ongoing customer input. The chart shows that high-maturity organizations have higher implementation rates for most of these actions.)

### 4. Appreciating and investing in talent

Cyber issues and activities are ultimately about
people—whether it is an attacker trying to exploit
vulnerabilities, decision-makers responsible for cyber
strategies and tactics, or the frontline employees
running digital business processes and cyber
programs. Strong talent—in the form of people who
are skilled, experienced, and cyber-focused—is a
prerequisite for strong performance. Looking beyond
traditional talent profiles has become crucial for
securing the right people to drive cyber initiatives.
For example, a customer experience designer might
bring needed insights for cyber initiatives, helping
to identify potential vulnerabilities when it comes to
transactional processes, data collection, or privacy.

Attracting and retaining talent—the right talent—is
difficult. Stress and other pressures come naturally
with any position of
