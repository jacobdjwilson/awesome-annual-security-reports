No longer just an obligation or a collection of tech-focused hygiene practices, cyber has grown into a critical function for helping businesses deliver outcomes
2
No longer just an obligation or a collection of tech-
focused hygiene practices, cyber has grown into 
a critical function for helping businesses deliver 
outcomes, and the results of Deloitte’s 2023 Future 
of Cyber Survey illuminate this. This year’s global 
survey—Deloitte’s largest cyber survey to date—
polled leaders across industries in order to get a 
clearer picture of where cyber stands and where it is 
going. What we discovered is that cyber’s profile as an 
enabler is growing. Among organizations of all sizes, 
cyber is consistently earning a place on the agenda, 
becoming a focal point for business-critical initiatives 
and investment.
We are excited about the future of cyber, and I 
invite you to join us in exploring some of the key 
findings in this report. In addition to data derived 
from the survey results, the report also includes 
observations and insights taken directly from 
survey respondents, as well as additional Deloitte 
insights on cyber, cloud, and other technologies 
enabling the future of business. 
Stay well,
Emily Mossburg, 
Deloitte Global Cyber Leader
The answer is cyber
Today, we are seeing the emergence of powerful new attitudes 
when it comes to cyber. Leaders are looking at cyber through 
a sharp, new lens—one that reveals the inherent business 
value that can come by embedding cyber. Not only across the 
enterprise, but as a crucial part of a powerful growth strategy.

## VIEW FROM THE TOP
The future of cyber is coming into sharper focus as 
organizations worldwide begin to look beyond the 
tech-centric and threat focus toward the potential 
positive outcomes they can achieve by deeply 
integrating cyber thinking and cyber actions across 
their businesses.
The world is increasingly interconnected, bringing 
about new risks alongside the new growth 
opportunities. Digital technologies, exponential 
growth of data, and evolving business needs are 
expanding attack threat surfaces and bringing new 
challenges that elevate cyber as a strategic business 
issue. Collaboration across cyber, risk management, 
and business units is critical to neutralizing 
cyberthreats, protecting business value, and 
sustaining customer trust.
In recent years, many enterprise leaders were 
focusing on the continued transition to digital 
business processes, as well as their technology 
environments and the rapid evolution of the cyber 
threat landscape. In fact, managing hybrid IT and 
digital transformation have emerged as two of the 
greatest challenges businesses face—solidifying 
complexity as the new norm for the enterprise.[^1]
Today, a new reality is taking shape, based on Deloitte’s 
2023 Global Future of Cyber Survey, which asked 
hundreds of leaders across industries and across the 
globe to share their views on cyber threats, enterprise 
activities, and the future. The survey included C
-suite 
executives across the enterprise, as well as other senior 
leaders with responsibility for IT, security, and risk. This 
new reality is grounded by the following findings.
Cyber is evolving into a distinct functional area of the 
business, transcending its traditional IT roots and 
becoming an essential part of the framework for 
delivering business outcomes.

Cyber beyond
Relationship transformation
“
We’re starting to see a far more significant focus 
on cybersecurity as an enterprise business risk. 
Across the organization, there is a significant shift 
in partnership in viewing cybersecurity as a core 
ingredient of our transformation and not a side 
garnish or afterthought. We’re doing a lot in terms 
of embedding cyber—whether it’s DevSecOps or 
in product development—where we’re starting 
to co-create with the (internal) partners to make 
sure that we’re building things securely. It’s like 
cultural transformation.”
—Allan Cockriel, Group CIO/CISO, Shell

## VIEW FROM THE TOP
Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, cyber is 
growing far beyond its technology roots. For many 
organizations, cyber now weaves more tightly into 
business operations, outcomes, and opportunities. 
Cyber is more than technology-focused. It is 
foundational. Among cyber decision-makers across 
an organization, it has become part of the structure 
of the business, an embedded element for supporting 
business ambitions.
Just as cyber threats shifted from an IT problem to a 
business problem, we also now see a shift in cyber 
strategies from IT to the business—ultimately to 
support strategic business objectives and growth. 
Cyber as a business priority is becoming more 
evident at the board level. In this year’s survey, 70% 
of respondents reported that cyber was on their 
board’s agenda on a regular basis, either monthly or 
quarterly. This clearly demonstrates that cyber has 
earned an important seat at the table where high-
level, strategic business decisions are made. 
Organizations increasingly recognize the role cyber 
plays in enabling broad business success.
An overwhelming majority of survey respondents 
identified a strong connection between cyber and 
business impact—with 86% reporting that cyber 
initiatives made a significant, positive contribution 
on at least one key business priority. And most 
organizations are looking to build on that value 
proposition, with 58% planning to increase their  
cyber investment in the next year.
Savvy boards
“
Boards clearly care about cybersecurity, and they 
will allocate resources at an impressive level. 
Boards are now educated enough to identify 
where is their competent security leadership and 
where is someone who’s buying their way out of 
the problem. And as they recognize the difference, 
it’s going to change the senior executives’ and 
board’s tolerance.”

## VIEW FROM THE TOP
Despite cyber’s potential as a business enabler, the 
ability to leverage it effectively can be inconsistent 
across organizations. Some organizations have 
emerged as clear leaders, defining a path to value for 
others to follow.
As part of this year’s survey, Deloitte identified high-
performing, cyber-mature organizations based on 
their level of cyber planning, their engagement on 
cyber at the board level, and the level of strategic 
action they have taken on cyber. These organizations 
are fully implementing actions that are important for 
cyber hygiene, including: an operational and strategic 
plan, an action plan to continuously improve the 
organization’s information security, and a cyber risk 
program to monitor and track the security posture of 
partners and suppliers.
These organizations, especially, are making the 
connection between cyber efforts and business value. 
They are more likely to report that cyber initiatives 
made a positive impact to a large extent on:
- Brand reputation
- Customer and digital trust
- Operational stability, including the supply chain  
and partner ecosystem
- Revenue
Organizations with high cyber maturity also are 
more likely to report that cyber brings value to key 
business strategies—providing the organization with 
confidence to try new things, increasing business 
agility, and enabling efficiency. And they are more 
likely to report seeing very high value from the third-
party cyber services that they engage.
Moving the business forward
“Projects, initiatives, business objectives can’t 
be met without thinking through information 
security and privacy impacts, and having that 
embedded into the appropriate processes. 
We’re brought in during the ideation phase as 
it relates to business components and aspects. 
Our strategy is 100% focused on supporting the 
business, recognizing that cyber and privacy do 
not exist without the business. We want to ensure 
that we are meaningfully contributing to moving 
the business forward, driving growth, and doing 
so in a manner that’s compliant and secure.”
—Arno Van Der Walt, SVP and CISO, Marriott

## METHODOLOGY
How we 
developed 
the insights
Methodology
Headquarters locations of the organizations we surveyed
Deloitte designed its 2023 Global Future of Cyber 
Survey based on the complexity of today’s business 
and technology landscape, focusing on the needs 
of enterprise leaders who may recognize the 
importance of cyber yet struggle to harness its value. 
Deloitte based its research on a survey of more than 
1,000 cyber decision-makers at the director level or 
higher (C-suite executives and C-suite direct reports), 
across 20 countries and limited to organizations 
with at least 1,000 employees and US$500 million in 
annual revenue.
 
To accurately capture the increased impact that 
cyber has on businesses today, we nearly doubled 
the sample size from the 2021 research, from almost 
600 respondents to 1,110. Deloitte also conducted 
in-depth interviews with a number of senior cyber 
decision-makers across various industries and 
geographies, to glean more detailed insights and 
to help validate our observations. Our approach 
covered every aspect relevant to the future of cyber, 
from strategy to tactics to culture to technology 
implementation.
At the core of this research, we focused our 
intentions and efforts on:
- Exploring how cyber has changed since Deloitte’s 
2021 report
- Applying a forward-thinking lens, to help bring the 
future of cyber into sharper focus 
- Understanding the business value and impact of 
cyber that organizations are experiencing, and the 
distinct actions leading organizations are taking to 
gain more value from cyber

8
## THE IMPERATIVE
By separating high-cyber-maturity organizations 
from their medium- and low-cyber-maturity 
counterparts, we can identify a distinct class of 
cyber leaders and more fully understand the 
extent to which cyber underpins business success 
and value.  
Today, cyber means business, and it is difficult to 
overstate the importance of cyber as a foundational 
and integral business imperative. For any enterprise, 
the future of cyber will be shaped by the C-suite and 
the board’s commitment, and by the business value 
that the entire organization can envision with cyber. 
Altogether, the results of our research show a new 
dynamic emerging as the CISO and the rest of the 
C-suite, along with the board, work in partnership to 
lead the business and enable innovation—together.
Put another way, cyber should be embedded across 
the broader business strategy. It should be included 
in every functional area, as an essential ingredient 
for success—to drive continuous business value, not 
simply mitigate risks to IT.
Demonstrating impact
“
Where we minimize risk, we can clearly articulate 
where and how we have made an impact and how 
we’ve allowed operations to continue in a smooth 
and effective way—especially relative to our 
business partners that in many cases have had 
either operational or integration challenges.”
—CISO, Consumer Organization
In addition to providing essential context for how cyber has evolved 
over the past two years, we developed a view on cyber maturity to 
understand the business impact that leading organizations make 
when they adopt more mature cyber strategies.
The future is cyber

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Both the 2021 survey and this latest survey asked 
respondents about their organizations’ digital 
transformation priorities—to help identify which 
technologies were important to the organization 
and would, therefore, need to be considered as 
part of future cyber strategies. 
Compared to companies’ top two priorities in 2021, 
cloud moved from the #2 spot to the #1 spot, 
displacing data analytics. Operational technology/
industrial control systems and artificial intelligence/
cognitive computing remained in the top five, moving 
up slightly. Joining the top-5 list this year is newcomer 
5G, reflecting the growing role of the standard in 
organizations’ business ambitions.  
The continued importance of cloud brings with it the 
complex cyber considerations that are inherent in 
hosting data and applications off premises and often 
across various environments. While cloud—and cyber 
cloud—maturity varies considerably, findings in our 
recent Future of Cloud Survey suggest that many 
organizations are overcoming those concerns and 
achieving highly positive outcomes for risk-related 
cloud use cases. In fact, 83% of organizations say their 
cloud investments are driving positive outcomes in 
terms of mitigating business and regulatory risk.[^2] This 
is a positive signal regarding maturing cyber cloud 
capabilities, shared responsibility models, and data 
privacy programs being put into place.
Since our previous report in the last quarter of 2021, global 
industries have continued to navigate constant disruption on 
multiple fronts, while adjusting their priorities, business initiatives, 
and capabilities accordingly.

THEN AND NOW

## The role of cyber
As part of our latest Global Future of Cyber survey, 
we asked about the role that cyber plays in each 
of these leading digital transformation initiatives. 
The results are clear: executives see cyber playing a 
crucial role for all digital transformation priorities, 
especially when it comes to cloud, data analytics, 
and 5G (Figure 1).
While digital priorities and emerging technologies have 
evolved, so too have the effects of cyber incidents on 
organizations we analyzed. Even as the organization’s 
focus shifts to the positive benefits and long-term 
business value that cyber readiness can bring, it 
is important to keep sight of cyber’s core ability to 
counter cyber threats, mitigating negative business 
consequences and risks.

## THEN AND NOW
Insights on incidents and impact
The frequency of cyber incidents or breaches has 
been growing, with 91% of organizations reporting 
at least one, compared to 88% in the 2021 survey. A 
multitude of actors, sources, tools, and techniques 
are part of the cyber concerns for organizations. 
High-maturity organizations seem more concerned 
about cyber criminals and terrorists, as well as 
phishing, malware, and ransomware attacks. Low- and 
medium-maturity companies have greater concern 
about denial-of-service attacks. It is worth noting that 
organizations with low maturity report experiencing 
more significant cybersecurity events (Figure 2).

(Precentage) 

13
## THEN AND NOW
Meanwhile, operational disruption continues to be the 
most significant impact of cyber incidents, although 
loss of revenue and loss of customer trust jumped in 
the rankings—to second and third place—with 56% 
of respondents reporting that they suffered related 
consequences to a moderate or large extent. One 
potential hypothesis in play here: Organizations with a 
higher level of maturity may view the impacts differently, 
as they have a deeper understanding of what is actually 
happening in their business. Less mature organizations 
may be evaluating theoretical impacts. Regardless, 
high-maturity organizations do appear to be reaping 
significantly more positive benefits from cyber 
initiatives—including improved brand reputation and 
trust, operational benefits, and financial benefits. Low- 
and medium-maturity groups seem more likely to gain 
benefits around brand reputation and improving trust, 
as opposed to other areas.
In the context of these significant impacts, the need for 
a risk-based cyber strategy—across the organization’s 
ecosystem of cyber strategies, solutions, and controls—
is ever more important for the future of cyber. A zero 
trust architecture can enable modern enterprise 
environments by strengthening security posture, 
simplifying security management, and improving end-
user experience. And the journey to zero trust requires 
a strategy aligned to business outcomes plus significant 
effort and planning, including addressing foundational 
cyber issues, automating manual processes, and 
planning for transformational changes to the security 
organization, the technology landscape, and the 
enterprise itself.[^3]

More than zero
A zero trust implementation is much more than a technological 
implementation, it is also a business and cultural transformation that 
is dependent on culture, communications, and awareness.
 A comprehensive zero trust implementation should address a 
number of elements, including governance (architecture and 
operations), enablers such as analytics and automation, and core 
domains such as identities, data, and devices.

## WHY MATURITY MATTERS
Understanding 
what it means to 
be cyber mature
In today’s environment of heightened cyber 
importance, we drew from our experience 
working with thousands of organizations 
worldwide to segment respondents 
according to their cyber maturity.
Defining maturity
To define cyber maturity and identify the high performers who are shaping the future of cyber, we used three 
sets of leading practices to rate organizations:
Robust cyber planning, 
indicated by the presence of 
strategic, operational, and tactical 
plans to defend against and 
respond to cyber threats
Key cyber activities, such as 
qualitative and quantitative 
risk assessment, industry 
benchmarking, and incident-
response scenario planning
Effective board engagement, 
exemplified by organizations 
whose boards address cyber-
related issues on a regular basis
A closer look at maturity groups
By assigning point values to each set of leading practices, we were able to segment the surveyed organizations 
into three groups:
Medium cyber 
maturity organizations, 
adhering to 1 of the sets 
of leading practices
41%
High cyber maturity 
organizations,  
adhering to 2–3 sets  
of leading practices
21%
Low cyber maturity 
organizations, adhering  
to none of the sets  
of leading practices
38%
Maturity at any size,  
in any industry
In looking across the three 
groups, we dug into their broader 
characteristics to identify any 
trends or traits for maturity. 
All three of the segments (low, 
medium, high) spanned industries 
as well as organization size and 
revenue—indicating that maturity 
level may not be significantly 
dependent on a company’s 
industry or size.

15
## WHY MATURITY MATTERS
While CISOs can serve as organizational  
champions for cyber, many of these leading 
practices only become possible through 
enterprisewide engagement. 
That can take the form of:
- Having a governing body that comprises  
IT and senior business leaders to oversee the 
cyber program
- Conducting incident-response scenario planning and 
simulation at the organizational and/or board level
- Regularly providing cyber updates to the board,  
to secure funding
- Annual cyber awareness training among  
all employees
The high-maturity organizations that we identified 
recognize the effectiveness of distributing cyber 
responsibilities throughout the organization. Such 
efforts align with Deloitte’s common guidance of 
embedding cyber professionals within business 
units, or at least having someone in each business 
unit with a clear responsibility for coordinating 
with the cyber team. They are 31% less likely to cite 
inadequate governance across their organization as 
a top challenge in managing cyber (35% for low cyber 
maturity vs. 34% for medium cyber maturity vs. 22% 
for high cyber maturity).
Crucially, the three leading practices that we identified—cyber 
planning, activities, and board involvement—hinge on stakeholders 
recognizing the importance of cyber responsibility and engagement 
across the whole organization.

## WHY MATURITY MATTERS
Industry 
Of the six industries included in this study, three of 
them have five or more cyber activities implemented—
slightly higher than the overall average. Those three 
industries include government/public services (GPS); 
energy/resources/industrials (ERI); and technology/
media/telecom (TMT). 
Two industries (ERI and life sciences/health care) have 
five or more cyber planning strategies implemented, at 
a level slightly higher than the overall average. 
Meanwhile, the financial services industry is 
implementing four out of eight cyber planning strategies 
at levels slightly higher than the overall average. That 
industry, however, is behind the overall average when 
it comes to cyber activities, with only one activity rising 
above the overall average. 
And our data showed that the consumer industry is 
slightly behind other industries and the overall average, 
with seven out of the ten key cyber activities, slightly 
behind the overall average, and with all of the cyber 
planning strategies being implemented at levels below 
the overall average. 
Organization size
The research also indicated that companies with 
20,000 or more employees are more likely to: 
- Understand the importance of business strategies
around risk management, digital transformation,
digital trust, and technology modernization.
- Recognize the importance of cyber in these
business strategies.
- Engage in cyber planning and implementing key
cyber activities.
The bottom line
Any organization, regardless of industry or size, can 
move toward high cyber performance and maturity. 
Success should not depend solely on your ability 
to “buy” maturity through increased investments in 
cyber. Rather, the actions that you take and the culture 
that you build will be primary factors for improving 
performance.
The survey defined small 
companies as those with 
revenue of US$500 million to 
US$1 billion. Large companies 
included organizations with  
US$10 billion or more in revenue.

## WHY MATURITY MATTERS
Bolstering the business with cyber
Building a bigger business case for cyber
Regardless of an organization’s maturity, there is no 
cyber architecture or approach that can guarantee 
absolute security and risk mitigation. Instead, the most 
striking feature of highly cyber-mature organizations 
is their ability to extract value from their cyber 
investments.
High performers are doing more when it comes to 
engaging leadership, planning, and acting—and it 
appears to be generating more business value from 
their cyber efforts. In terms of seeing impacts like 
increased efficiency, resiliency, and agility, those highly 
mature organizations are ahead of the pack, and they 
are recognizing benefits that may not be typically 
associated with cyber.
Generating confidence and much more
More than half of these leaders (55%) reported that 
cyber provides them with confidence to try new 
things—compared to 45% for medium-maturity 
organizations and 40% for low-maturity organizations. 
And nearly 70% of highly mature organizations said 
cyber was making an impact on both enhancing trust 
and enabling efficiency—significantly higher than the 
low- and medium-maturity organizations.
Likewise, a majority of highly mature leaders (65%) also 
cited resilience and agility as benefits of cyber—once

## WHY MATURITY MATTERS
The highest-performing organizations also were more 
likely to report positive contributions from their cyber 
initiatives in areas such as improved brand reputation 
(64%), increased revenue (47%), improved operational 
stability involving the supply chain and partner 
ecosystem (59%), talent recruitment and retention 
(49%), long-term sustainability (64%), improved 
customer trust and brand impact (62%). 
Trust is an issue of paramount importance when 
it comes to cyber. As an “ecosystem” that can help 
deliver outcomes, trust needs to be built with all of 
your human stakeholders. A trusting workforce, for 
example, achieves 2x improved customer satisfaction, 
and customers who trust a brand are 88% more likely 
to buy again.[^4]  Building customer trust also affects 
partners and improves up to 4x market capitalization, 
with trusted companies ultimately outperforming 
their peers by up to 400%.
And based on the data from our 2023 Global Future 
of Cyber Survey, global organizations can clearly see 
the connection to benefits including trust. While 
organizations that are investing in cyber are seeing 
significant gains across a range of value measures, 
the highest performers get more of that value across 
every strategic measure (Figure 6).

partners and improves market 
capitalization, with trusted 
companies ultimately

Customer expectations
“
The customer—my personal guess—is not 
willing to pay a lot extra for cybersecurity (in our 
products). They will expect to have it. It will be a 
differentiator.”

## WHY MATURITY MATTERS
One other area in which highly mature cyber 
organizations exceeded their peers in the low and 
medium group: the value they are seeing from using 
third-party cyber services.
A majority of these high performers reported 
measurable value when it came to third-party services 
for cyber strategy, data protection and privacy, cyber 
cloud, infrastructure security, and application security.
