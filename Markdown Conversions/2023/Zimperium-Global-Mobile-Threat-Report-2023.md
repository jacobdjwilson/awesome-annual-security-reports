## Executive Perspective

### 1.1 Mobile-Powered Business: Huge Opportunities…and Risks
Shridhar Mittal, CEO at Zimperium

#### The Emergence of Mobile-First Users
In recent years, mobile devices have continued to proliferate around the globe and become increasingly woven into the fabric of our daily lives. As a result, we’ve become mobile-first users—where mobile devices are our first choice for how we communicate, navigate, bank, take photos, shop, and stay informed. In turn, the companies that support us have shifted into mobile-powered businesses. Mobile-powered businesses are those organizations that are harnessing the unique power of mobile devices and apps to improve profitability, productivity, and customer experiences.

Worldwide, there were 7.1 billion mobile device users in 2021, and that number is expected to grow to 7.5 billion by 2025. Mobile app usage and purchases have also continued to grow and reach a massive scale. In 2022, revenue from mobile apps exceeded $400 billion. Mobile apps now account for 60% of e-commerce purchases. One survey found that 89% of respondents now use mobile banking apps. That number is even higher, at 97%, if we include millennials.

Mobile devices are now also integral to the way we work. Last year’s report revealed that 60% of the endpoints accessing enterprise assets were mobile devices. Employees are using mobile devices to interact with more apps, conduct more transactions, collaborate with more people, and access more data. And mobile devices are almost always the additional factor in multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions that govern access to corporate resources, including desktops and laptops.

#### The Thriving Business is a Mobile-Powered Business
The opportunities created and enabled by mobile-powered businesses are enormous. Teams can establish new, more profitable services and new arenas of engagement that provide more convenience, safety, and value. Here at Zimperium, we have a front-row seat to see hundreds of these strategic efforts up close. Every day, we protect mobile-powered initiatives for some of the largest and best-known organizations in the world, as they use mobile to enable their employees (e.g., remote work, bring your own device [BYOD], point of sale) and serve their consumers (e.g., mobile banking, app-connected medical devices, automobile apps).

The mobile-first user isn’t going anywhere. The mobile-first user will only continue to grow more reliant upon these services—and less tolerant of the businesses and agencies that fail to deliver them. Businesses that fail to adapt to this new reality will run the risk of losing market share to those who do.

### 1.2 5 Security Principles of a Mobile-First Security Strategy
Jon Paterson, CTO at Zimperium

#### The Implications of Securing Mobile-Powered Business Initiatives
Mobile-powered initiatives are critical to profitability, productivity, and competitiveness. Mobile devices and apps are how customers interact with organizations and how employees access resources, collaborate, and work. In virtually every sphere of our lives, mobile devices are ubiquitous. This ubiquity has created several key implications for organizations:

*   Diverse devices are accessing corporate data, including employee-owned mobile phones and other devices that aren’t managed by corporate IT teams.
*   As this report will detail, threats to mobile apps and devices continue to rise in both volume and sophistication.
*   The number of mobile apps an organization offers to employees continues to increase, and at the same time, the number and type of apps that are active on employee and customer devices is exploding.
*   Sophistication of risks related to mobile are increasing, and businesses want to provide more direct access to mobile devices in zero trust environments, creating new challenges for CISOs and security organizations.
*   Regulations and mandates related to application and user data continue to be more onerous, and more difficult to adhere to when addressing the global needs of an organization.

#### The Unique Security Challenges Posed by Mobile Devices and Apps
With the introduction of mobile devices and apps to the organization, security teams face a new set of challenges and need to be aware of new threat vectors and areas of risk:

*   **Devices**: In a BYOD environment, mobile users are the “device administrators,” often with complete control over the apps they download, when (and whether) to install patches or updates, which permissions to grant, and more. Rather than operating in a relatively protected corporate environment, devices can be used anywhere, may be left anywhere, and are frequently connected to public Wi-Fi. Even in Unified Endpoint Management/Mobile Device Management (UEM/MDM)-managed scenarios, the user continues to have override control for security decisions unless fully supervised. Many organizations allow mobile devices on corporate Wi-Fi without full security assurance. This practice opens the opportunity for a mobile device to be used as an entry-point to other corporate resources.
*   **Apps for business**: Traditional enterprise business applications run in a secure data center on servers organizations control. And mobile apps are deployed to app stores, where they are exposed to reverse engineering and tampered with by attackers, and ultimately run on end-user devices that are outside the control of the app owner with data primarily held in the cloud. Businesses often assess the cloud services they use and how they store data as part of a risk assessment, but the app itself is assumed secure. It’s imperative that organizations assess this potential risk on a continuous basis.
*   **Apps for consumers**: Consumer apps are making their way into the corporate world and pose potential security risks to the business. For example, employees access clipboard content and share resources and files on the device. As security professionals, how do we assess the potential risks of such applications, and have processes to assess and respond at scale?

The level and scope of risk continues to increase and evolve. At the same time, resources within organizations enabled to address mobile threats and complexities are in short supply. The result is a “Vulnerability Gap” that jeopardizes mobile-powered businesses with blind spots and an exponentially increasing number of exposure points.

![The escalating Vulnerability Gap chart showing increasing volume of mobile threats, unmanaged devices, explosion of apps, continuous innovations, and regulations/privacy, leading to a growing vulnerability gap with uncontrolled blind spots and exposure points, while resources remain limited over time.](Image description: A chart illustrating the escalating vulnerability gap in mobile security, showing an upward trend in mobile threats, unmanaged devices, app explosion, continuous innovations, and regulations, contrasted with limited resources over time.)

The fundamental question is this: “How do organizations realize the potential of mobile-powered initiatives without jeopardizing the integrity of the business?” (In other words, how do they solve the Vulnerability Gap?)

#### Five Key Principles of a Mobile-First Security Strategy
Zimperium has helped thousands of enterprises and government agencies around the world answer that important question of how to solve the Vulnerability Gap. From over a decade of experience, we know that the answer lies in having policies and controls addressing the challenges with a Mobile-First Security Strategy—a strategy that accounts for all of the complexities and realities of mobile devices, apps, users, and business models; one that supports and enables mobile-powered initiatives and enables users and productivity rather than slowing them down or constricting them.

We believe there are five key principles to a complete, scalable, and effective mobile-first security strategy:

1.  **Prioritize and assess risk as close to the user or point of entry as possible.** Organizations need to prioritize securing mobile-powered business initiatives across all mobile devices and apps.
2.  **Operate in a known state - visibility and vulnerability assessment for all your entry points.** Gain complete visibility of your mobile ecosystem and risk level. Automatically assess vulnerabilities and address them—without throttling productivity. Establish safeguards that are measurable, auditable, and insurable.
3.  **Enhance your detection and response strategy for mobile.** Detect anomalies and prioritize remediations based on contextual intelligence—so the most critical gaps get addressed first. Embed security across the device and application lifecycle, provide risk-based response, and enable zero trust assessment of mobile endpoints.
4.  **Start the autonomous journey.** Dynamically respond to ever-changing threats and mobile ecosystems. Automatically isolate compromised devices and untrusted environments. Establish a proactive, resilient, and scalable security posture.
5.  **Minimize risk compliance failures.** Stay ahead of regulations, data sovereignty and privacy standards, while respecting employees’ work/life boundaries.

#### A Real World Example
A great example of a well-considered Mobile-First Security Strategy is that of a major international organization who, prior to working with Zimperium, had a restrictive mobile security strategy where all devices, regardless of corporate-owned or BYOD, were required to be enrolled into UEM for device management. This caused friction with BYOD end users. Due to the lack of visibility to vulnerability and risk, they only supported a small subset of handset vendors that were approved for BYOD use.

By leveraging mobile threat defense (Key Principle #1), the organization gained better visibility into its risk posture and enabled the adoption of a broader range of device models & manufacturers. This allowed them to accelerate its BYOD strategy—while providing real-time insights into the risks on those devices (Key Principles #2 and #3). It also gave them the ability to provide and deliver automated response (Key Principle #4) without compromising security.

As a result, the bank has been able to achieve the vision of its mobile-powered initiative without security impacts. This is exactly how a Mobile-First Security Strategy should work in real life.

The same organization was able to leverage the Zimperium Mobile Application Protection Suite (MAPS) to provide runtime security insight to their mobile application (Key Principles #1, #2, and #3), as many of their customers were being targeted for scams/fraud via social engineering and malicious app installation. With the implementation of security telemetry inside their consumer banking app, they can now gain visibility to the risks, and automatically respond to them within the app (Key Principle #4). All of this can be accomplished while ensuring that they meet compliance and data sovereignty requirements (Key Principle #5).

As a result, the organization has been able to achieve its vision of its mobile-powered initiative, reducing risk—and providing visibility, actionable insights, and automated response.

#### Let's Get Practical
There’s no turning back. The mobile-powered business is here to stay. Given that reality, what are some practical steps that security teams can take? Here are some key questions to consider:

##### Corporate Device and Application Usage Considerations
When developing your strategy to protect mobile devices and assessing the apps they contain, consider the following questions:

*   How are you baselining your initial mobile device risk posture for both managed and unmanaged devices and responding dynamically to elevated risk?
*   How many mobile devices are accessing your corporate assets that are unmanaged or without visibility?
*   What is your strategy for BYO devices and unmanaged applications?
*   What are your zero trust initiatives, and where does mobile fit?
*   What is your vision for consolidating mobile security telemetry as part of your data lake and extended detection and response (XDR) strategies?
*   Organizations often have a solid strategy for email phishing attacks - How do you reduce risk, measure, and respond to mobile phishing attacks?
*   What is your strategy for mobile ransomware and spyware?
*   How are you assessing the potential risk of publicly available applications on your managed and unmanaged devices?
*   How are you addressing local privacy and data laws and compliance needs across your mobile assets (devices and apps)?

##### Mobile Application Development Considerations
When developing applications internally, or if applications are developed for your organization by third parties, consider the following questions:

*   Often organizations are using external services for application review - typically, security flaws are assessed. Knowing that development teams release versions of apps one to four times a month, how do you deliver assurance of security at scale without impacting development performance?
*   How are you assessing privacy and compliance issues of the applications you are releasing?
*   Are your apps using code obfuscation or integrity checking? How are you attempting to thwart reverse engineering?
*   How well do your app protection approaches score when compared against Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP), Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS), National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), or Mobile Payments on COTS (MPoC) standards?
*   How are you assessing the risk posture of the devices your app is running on (beyond using simplistic open-source jailbreak or root detection to “tick the box”)? What security logic do you have in place to make decisions around device attestation?
    *   How do you keep up to date with new tool coverage?
*   How are you giving security or SOC teams visibility into the attacks, and providing forensics to use as part of a greater security workflow?
*   How will you attest the security mechanisms in place to auditors?
*   An average mobile application has several externally developed software development kits (SDKs). Do you feel you have a robust workflow for identifying risks due to third-party SDK usage?

##### Security Considerations as a Mobile User and Consumer
As users of mobile devices, there are some key steps you can take that will help reduce risk for both your device and the data that you use:

*   Apply security patches whenever available for your device.
*   Disable developer configurations on the device unless actively developing. Keep a separate developer device for this use case.
*   Prefer apps from known, approved stores over third-party ones.
*   Ensure that operating systems and apps are automatically updating. Vulnerabilities are often addressed in updates as well as new features added.
*   Check and consider permissions apps are requesting at download and when running.
*   Read the reviews on apps before installing. If there are complaints of suspicious behaviors, be wary of installation.
*   Leverage external app review services, if available, to provide risk or privacy visibility prior to downloading.
*   Avoid public Wi-Fi usage. If you must use them, leverage a VPN to encrypt traffic.
*   Leverage SMS and malicious URL and phishing protection solutions. As the report will highlight, this is a significant vector of attack that needs robust, immediate solutions.

The 2023 Global Mobile Threat Report is largely built on the data and experiences we’ve gained in helping customers institute Mobile-First Security Strategies. We sincerely hope that you will find the information insightful and helpful as you consider how best to protect your organization’s mobile-powered business.

### 1.3 Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Mobile Security
Nico Chiaraviglio, Chief Scientist at Zimperium

In 1977, the first West Coast Computer Fair was held. During the fair, Ted Nelson gave an exposition titled, “Those unforgettable next two years,”, highlighting the explosion of personal computers that was about to occur. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), we are now experiencing a new version of those “unforgettable next two years.”. Unless you were living completely off the grid, you’ve probably heard of and perhaps even interacted with ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot implementing a language model trained on the whole corpus of human knowledge. Early assessments show that ChatGPT is capable of solving almost any language-oriented task—unless that task is math related (just like for many actual people, math is AI’s least favorite subject). Furthermore, a recent paper from Microsoft claims that ChatGPT-4 is showing sparks of artificial general intelligence.

ChatGPT is only one of many AI milestones in recent years. Last year, there was a succession of milestones:

*   Google’s LaMDA emerged as the first AI system to pass the Turing test.
*   Several developments in scientific fields with DeepMind models for protein folding and matrix multiplication.
*   Advances in text-to-image and text-to-video with OpenAI’s DALL-E and Meta’s Make-A-Video models.
*   New successes in speech-to-speech translation, among several other fields.

#### Why AI is Such a Game-Changer in Cybersecurity
AI is also revolutionizing cybersecurity, demonstrating its facility as the most effective way for organizations to adapt to an evolving threat landscape. AI is such a great leap forward because it can automate and perform tasks such as threat detection, vulnerability management, and network monitoring, to name a few. While not always given due credit in the media, the value of AI has been evident for many years. Perhaps the best example of this is the email spam filter, which has existed since 1996.

Since Zimperium’s inception, AI has been at the core of its technology and innovation, being the only mobile threat defense (MTD) provider that can run machine learning models on device to perform a myriad of tasks such as detecting malware, phishing, system exploits, network reconnaissance, jailbreak/rooting, and system anomalies. Our models are constantly evolving to adapt to changing threats and are updated continuously to deliver peak performance.

Due to its high efficiency and privacy-centric approach, Zimperium’s detection capabilities are protecting residents of Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, and Michigan; students and educators at K-12 institutions; and devices of the U.S. Department of Defense and thousands of enterprise organizations around the world. At the same time, Zimperium has partnered with Google as part of its App Defense Alliance to keep malware out of the Play Store.

AI innovation won’t stop in 2023; it will accelerate, and Zimperium will be at the forefront of the process.

### 1.4 The Way Forward for Unmanaged Devices
Jim Taylor, Chief Product Officer, RSA

The best code you’ll ever write is the code you write with your customers. That’s what happened in 2022, when one of our customers—and one of the world’s largest financial services organizations—told us they had a problem: they needed to secure users’ unmanaged devices.

This need wasn’t unique to this customer, or even to financial services generally. The global pandemic, financial headwinds, and remote work have all made unmanaged devices a fixture of the work-from-anywhere economy. Organizations don’t want to pay for every cellphone, laptop, and tablet. Employees don’t want their employers to install software on their phones.

While unmanaged devices may help an organization’s bottom line, they still come at a high cost. By their very nature, unmanaged devices aren’t as secure as managed hardware. And threat actors are taking notice: Verizon’s 2022 Mobile Security Index found that mobile-related compromise had doubled from 2021 to 2022. About one-fifth of successful phishing emails come from mobile devices, per the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report.

And it’s not just that organizations are encountering more breaches—it’s that those breaches have an even deeper impact: 73% of organizations that experienced a mobile-related compromise described it as a “major” breach. The 2022 IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report found that “costs where remote working was a factor in causing a breach” were roughly $1 million more than when employees were on site.

![73% of organizations that experienced a mobile-related compromise described it as a “major” breach.](Image description: A statistic highlighting that 73% of organizations experiencing a mobile-related compromise reported it as a "major" breach.)

#### Have Cake, Eat it Too
Unmanaged devices expand the attack surface, are inherently less secure than managed hardware, and are still a necessary part of doing business. Our customer wanted to have their cybersecurity cake and eat the cost savings, too. At the same time, cybercriminals wanted to poison the cake, burn down the kitchen, and ransom the recipes.

We found a way forward by working with Zimperium to develop RSA Mobile Lock, which prevents risks and detects on-device threats.

Mobile Lock is automatically deployed as part of the RSA Authenticator App—it’s not a second app that users need to manage. Once installed, Mobile Lock scans for critical risks like jailbroken devices, suspicious apps, elevation of privileges, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other threats. If it detects a threat, Mobile Lock restricts users from using the RSA Authenticator. When it detects a threat, Mobile Lock leaves all other systems on the device unaffected—a user can still call, text, connect to the Internet and, ideally, contact their IT department to resolve the issue.

Mobile Lock addressed our customer’s problem—they can now establish trust in unmanaged mobile devices. Since launching the solution in October 2022, we’re seeing early signs of massive uptake in the solution, with additional customers in healthcare, manufacturing and supply chain, and other financial services adopting Mobile Lock.

#### The Right Thing—Not Everything
The growing number of unmanaged devices is a major accelerant driving explosive growth in the attack surface: increasing users, entitlements, and environments are making larger, more interconnected, and more vulnerable IT universes.

Zimperium’s Global Mobile Threat Report and some of the highest-profile breaches in recent memory—including Colonial Pipeline, SolarWinds, and LAPSUS$—demonstrate how threat actors are successfully exploiting that growth. Zimperium’s observation that the volume and sophistication of attacks are increasing significantly is absolutely correct.

If anything, that’s putting it too lightly. There’s simply too much spread across too many fragmented security solutions for humans to process at speed or scale. Today, I can’t expect my security team to review everything—instead, I need them to prioritize the right thing. And the only way to do that is with automated intelligence solutions that find the signal in the noise, triage risks, and automate responses.

Our initial version of Mobile Lock was a great start at delivering those capabilities, but it was just a start. Cybersecurity’s way forward demands a comprehensive approach that ingests signals, risks, and threats across the entire IT estate and at every stage of the identity lifecycle. The next version of Mobile Lock will do just that: it will review a broader array of signals, risks, and threats and build that intelligence into a broader security fabric.

Mobile Lock v1 solved the last problem—Mobile Lock v2 will get ahead of the next problem. That’s right where our customers need us to be.

## The Mobile Attack Surface

### 2.1 Zimperium zLabs: 2023 Research Highlights

The Zimperium zLabs Advanced Research Group continuously investigates mobile device and application threats targeting users worldwide.

The zLabs team detected an average of 77,000 unique malware samples every month in 2022. Between 2021 and 2022, the team saw the total number of malware samples rise by 51%, with more than 920,000 samples detected.

The following is an overview of some of the most high-profile discoveries made by the zLabs team.

#### Dirty RatMilad: Android Spyware
Mobile spyware is no longer just the domain of sophisticated government surveillance teams and nation states. RatMilad is just one example of how this type of spyware is being employed by smaller organizations. This malware (which has various spyware capabilities such as data exfiltration techniques) has taken various forms. The original variant of RatMilad was hidden within a phone number spoofing app called Text Me, an app that purported to help users verify a social media account by phone. In the fall of 2022, zLabs discovered a live sample of RatMilad hidden within an app called NumRent, which is a renamed, updated version of Text Me. These apps are distributed through links in messages and social media posts.

#### MoneyMonger: Malware Disguised by Flutter
Near the end of 2022, zLabs announced the discovery of MoneyMonger. Disguised as an app enabling individuals to get loans, this malware campaign enables malicious actors to steal private data. MoneyMonger was discovered in a Flutter app. Flutter is an open-source software kit for developing cross-platform apps. Through Flutter, teams can develop and maintain one codebase while delivering native mobile apps on multiple device platforms. By taking advantage of Flutter’s framework, the threat actors behind MoneyMonger were able to obfuscate malicious features so they’re not detected by legacy mobile security products.

#### Dark Herring: Scamware Exceeds 100 Million Installations
Last year’s report featured an Android Trojan attack known as GriftHorse, outlining how it infected 10 million devices in over 70 countries. Unfortunately, since that time, the scamware threat only became more widespread. Early in 2022, zLabs discovered Dark Herring, another scamware campaign. Dark Herring has targeted more than 100 million victims globally. This campaign exploits direct carrier billing to scam money from unsuspecting users, with losses estimated to have reached hundreds of millions of dollars.

#### Cloud9: Chrome Extension Enables Remote Device Control
Late in the fall of 2022, the zLabs team discovered a malicious, potentially extremely dangerous extension to the Chrome browser. Dubbed Cloud9, this malware has the ability to steal information available during browser sessions. In addition, it can install malware that enables malicious actors to gain control over the infected device. This malware is distributed in a number of ways, including sideloading through fake executables and malicious websites purporting to provide users with Adobe Flash Player updates.

#### Schoolyard Bully: Trojan Credential Stealer Afflicts 300,000 Victims
Late in 2022, zLabs discovered a new Android threat campaign, the Schoolyard Bully Trojan. These trojans have been found in numerous apps that were downloaded from the Google Play Store and third-party app stores. The trojans are hidden within seemingly legitimate educational apps. Claiming more than 300,000 victims, the malware is focused on stealing an individual’s Facebook credentials. While these malicious apps have been removed from the Google Play store, they remain on numerous third-party app sites.

The zLabs team detected an average of 77,000 unique malware samples every month.

### 2.2 10 Mobile Attacks that Made Headlines in 2022

### 2.3 State of Mobile Endpoint Security in 2023

#### Global Mobile Device Market
Worldwide, there were 7.1 billion mobile device users in 2021, and that number is expected to reach 7.5 billion by 2025. Apple and Samsung continue to be the two smartphone vendors dominating the market. The number of unique mobile internet users increased to 5 billion, and over 60% of the global internet population uses a mobile device to go online. Mobile internet traffic now accounts for nearly 60% of global web traffic, and the volume of data being consumed continues to grow.

#### Mobile-powered Business Initiatives are Critical to Organizational Success
The surge in digital interactions has catapulted enterprises towards mobile-powered business models and the widespread move to support employees on their devices. With the continued proliferation of remote and hybrid workforces and BYOD policies, we have reached a tipping point for a new era of mobile ubiquity.

Enterprises had to adapt to a “get work done anytime and anywhere” mantra during the pandemic, which has made the need for mobile security more critical than ever. Mobile innovation has continued to make it easier for employees to collaborate, communicate, and access data, which is fueling increased productivity.

#### Mobile is the Modern Workplace
To get work done anywhere and anytime, employees are:

*   **Adopting increasing volumes of mobile apps.** 5.7 million apps are on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store combined. The average American has 80 apps downloaded on their phone.
*   **Collaborating with more people.** 76% of respondents use smartphones for communicating, making it the top-rated response. Seven in 10 individuals reported using mobile devices to send emails.
*   **Accessing a higher volume of data.** 47% of web traffic in the US is from mobile devices. 51% of smartphone users check their apps 1-10 times a day.

For security teams, integrating mobile device telemetry into zero trust frameworks is critical to protect mobile-powered business models. Attacks are growing in volume and sophistication, as shown in this report. A zero trust approach has to be ingrained as a best practice throughout the modern workforce for both the user and the device. If a device that accesses critical business information isn’t secured, one phishing link can lead to rogue access, or worse, ransomware for an enterprise.

#### Mobile Security Trends
Protecting mobile-powered businesses is difficult because mobile devices are an extension of people’s lives, and apps are often the front door to risk. In the modern workforce, users are the administrators; therefore, vetting an app is easier said than done. An everyday user can’t see beyond a privacy nutrition label. They do not know what countries or IP addresses are sharing their data or what third parties that data is being sold to.

Using unmanaged BYOD devices for work is continuing to trend upward. This trend escalates the vulnerability gap because it leaves the door open for mobile threats, privacy concerns, and regulatory consequences. This is why there has been an upward trend in both private and public sector organizations banning social media and other apps that could potentially expose information for nefarious purposes. When an app is used for entertainment and yet exposes corporate data, something has to be done.

Device attestation is another approach that will continue to be at the forefront of mobile security as business and personal apps present increased risk. Mobile devices are being used more and more for authentication purposes, such as MFA, to validate users’ identities. However, 2022’s headline attacks, like the one that led to a breach at Uber, amply demonstrate that MFA can be susceptible to compromise, which is why data attestation is critical for a mobile-first strategy. As RSA’s Chief Product Officer, Jim Taylor explained earlier in this report, RSA has elevated data attestation with RSA Mobile Lock. It detects critical threats to a mobile device and restricts the user’s ability to authenticate until the issue is resolved.

To say that mobile
