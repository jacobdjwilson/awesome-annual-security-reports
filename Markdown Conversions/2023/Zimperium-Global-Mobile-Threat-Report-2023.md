## 1.1: Mobile-Powered Business: Huge Opportunities…and Risks
Shridhar Mittal, CEO at Zimperium

The Emergence of Mobile-First Users
In recent years, mobile devices have continued to proliferate around the globe and become increasingly woven into the fabric of our daily 
lives. As a result, we’ve become mobile-first users—where mobile devices are our first choice for how we communicate, navigate, bank, 
take photos, shop, and stay informed. In turn, the companies that support us have shifted into mobile-powered businesses. Mobile-
powered businesses are those organizations that are harnessing the unique power of mobile devices and apps to improve profitability, 
productivity, and customer experiences.
Worldwide, there were 7.1 billion mobile device users in 2021, and that number is expected to grow to 7.5 billion by 2025.  Mobile app 
usage and purchases have also continued to grow and reach a massive scale. In 2022, revenue from mobile apps exceeded $400 billion. 
Mobile apps now account for 60% of e-commerce purchases.  One survey found that 89% of respondents now use mobile banking apps. 
That number is even higher, at 97%, if we include millennials. 
Mobile devices are now also integral to the way we work. Last year’s report revealed that 60% of the endpoints accessing enterprise 
assets were mobile devices. Employees are using mobile devices to interact with more apps, conduct more transactions, collaborate with 
more people, and access more data. And mobile devices are almost always the additional factor in multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
solutions that govern access to corporate resources, including desktops and laptops.
The Thriving Business is a Mobile-Powered Business
The opportunities created and enabled by mobile-powered businesses are enormous. 
Teams can establish new, more profitable services and new arenas of engagement that 
provide more convenience, safety, and value. Here at Zimperium, we have a front-row seat 
to see hundreds of these strategic efforts up close. Every day, we protect mobile-powered 
initiatives for some of the largest and best-known organizations in the world, as they use 
mobile to enable their employees (e.g., remote work, bring your own device [BYOD], point of 
sale) and serve their consumers (e.g., mobile banking, app-connected medical devices, 
automobile apps).
The mobile-first user isn’t going anywhere. The mobile-first user will only continue to grow 
more reliant upon these services—and less tolerant of the businesses and agencies that fail 
to deliver them. Businesses that fail to adapt to this new reality will run the risk of losing 
market share to those who do.

Security Teams Need to Adapt to the Mobile-Powered Business, Fast
The rise of the mobile-powered business has fundamental implications for security teams. The explosive growth in mobile device and app 
usage has created an ever-growing attack surface—and increasing numbers of sophisticated cyber criminals and nation states continue 
to exploit these areas of vulnerability. Meanwhile, security budgets and staffing levels remain relatively flat. Consequently, today’s teams 
are confronting large and rapidly growing vulnerability gaps.
The consequences of these vulnerability gaps have been devastating. For example, losses from online payment fraud cost e-commerce 
businesses $41 billion in 2022 and are expected to grow to $48 billion in 2023.  Another report found that 70% of digital fraud now occurs 
on mobile devices.
In 2023, enterprise security teams will still contend with the aftermath of the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid, massive shifts it precipitated. Telehealth, 
remote and hybrid work, cloud storage, short message service (SMS)-based 
multi-factor authentication, and QR codes are just a few examples of approaches 
that saw explosive growth in recent years—with each of these areas posing new 
security risks that teams haven’t fully addressed. For example, one report 
revealed that 79% of respondents felt that recent changes to working practices 
had adversely affected their organization’s cybersecurity. Nearly two-thirds (66%) 
of respondents indicated that they had previously come under pressure to 
sacrifice mobile-device security “to get the job done,” and 52% said they 
succumbed to that pressure.
The concerns expressed by security teams are well founded, with major attacks 
on the rise. The same report found that 45% of companies surveyed suffered a 
compromise in the past 12 months, up 22% over the prior year.

2023 Global Mobile Threat Report
As mobile phones continue to be used for increasingly essential services, whether shopping, banking, or working, cybercriminals know 
there are growing opportunities to profit. For those tasked with countering these attacks, security must address a range of threats, 
including:
- **Device vulnerabilities.** Mobile devices of every form continue to be vulnerable. In recent months, significant vulnerabilities have 
been discovered in both Android and iOS devices.  
- **Spyware.** Nation states continue to leverage spyware to pursue their objectives, and mobile devices continue to be targeted. 
U.S. ambassadors, Spain’s Prime Minister, and the former Prime Minister of the UK have all fallen victim to spyware. However, 
spyware isn’t just a threat to high-ranking government officials, and the public is increasingly aware of this fact. A Zimperium 
survey revealed that 85% of respondents felt spyware posed a threat to them and their organization. 
- **Phishing.** Phishing has been and continues to be one of the most prevalent forms of cyberattacks on mobile. Our researchers 
found that 80% of phishing sites now either specifically target mobile devices or are built to function on both mobile devices and 
desktops. The average user is 6-10 times more likely to fall for an SMS phishing attack than an email-based one.
In response to these escalating threats, 85% of organizations now have a budget dedicated to mobile security.
All these factors point to how critical it is to address mobile security comprehensively. Security teams need advanced, adaptive 
protections that safeguard against device, network, phishing, and app attacks. In addition, mobile apps must be effectively secured across 
the development lifecycle and post-deployment. What organizations truly need is a Mobile-First Security Strategy. Zimperium’s CTO, Jon 
Paterson, explains what this is and how to begin executing this type of strategy in the next section of this report.
We Hope You Find Our 2023 Global Mobile Threat Report Useful
While these emerging trends can be sobering and downright scary for security teams, they don’t have to be. This report is not intended to 
stoke fear but to provide an authoritative look at what is really happening in the global mobile threat landscape so teams will be able to 
make informed decisions about their risks and what to do about them. 
In this report, we’ve compiled and distilled some of the most important trends and developments that shaped the mobile security 
landscape over the last year and those that are most critical to respond to in 2023. This report draws on the research of our internal 
experts and the insights of our partners and leading industry observers.
We sincerely hope you find these insights useful as you seek to strengthen security in our increasingly mobile-first world. If you ever need 
additional information to inform your strategies and plans, rest assured that the Zimperium team is here to help.

## 1.2: 5 Security Principles of a Mobile-First Security Strategy
Jon Paterson, CTO  at Zimperium

The Implications of Securing Mobile-Powered Business Initiatives
Mobile-powered initiatives are critical to profitability, productivity, and competitiveness. Mobile devices and apps are how customers 
interact with organizations and how employees access resources, collaborate, and work. In virtually every sphere of our lives, mobile 
devices are ubiquitous. This ubiquity has created several key implications for organizations:
- Diverse devices are accessing corporate data, including employee-owned mobile phones and other devices that aren’t managed by 
corporate IT teams.
- As this report will detail, threats to mobile apps and devices continue to rise in both volume and sophistication.
- The number of mobile apps an organization offers to employees continues to increase, and at the same time, the number and type of 
apps that are active on employee and customer devices is exploding.
- Sophistication of risks related to mobile are increasing, and businesses want to provide more direct access to mobile devices in zero 
trust environments, creating new challenges for CISOs and security organizations.
- Regulations and mandates related to application and user data continue to be more  onerous, and more difficult to adhere to when 
addressing the global needs of an organization.

The Unique Security Challenges Posed by Mobile Devices and Apps
With the introduction of mobile devices and apps to the organization, security teams face a new set of challenges and need to be aware 
of new threat vectors and areas of risk:
- **Devices:** In a BYOD environment, mobile users are the “device administrators,” often 
with complete control over the apps they download, when (and whether) to install patches 
or updates, which permissions to grant, and more. Rather than operating in a relatively 
protected corporate environment, devices can be used anywhere, may be left anywhere, 
and are frequently connected to public Wi-Fi. Even in Unified Endpoint Management/
Mobile Device Management (UEM/MDM)-managed scenarios, the user continues to 
have override control for security decisions unless fully supervised. Many organizations 
allow mobile devices on corporate Wi-Fi without full security assurance. This practice 
opens the opportunity for a mobile device to be used as an entry -point to other corporate 
resources.
- **Apps for business:** Traditional enterprise business applications run in a secure data 
center on servers organizations control. And mobile apps are deployed to app stores, 
where they are exposed to reverse engineering and tampered with by attackers, and 
ultimately run on end- user devices that are outside the control of the app owner with data 
primarily held in the cloud. Businesses often assess the cloud services they use and how 
they store data as part of a risk assessment, but the app itself is assumed secure. It’s 
imperative that organizations assess this potential risk on a continuous basis.
- **Apps for consumers:** Consumer apps are making their way into the corporate world and 
pose potential security risks to the business. For example, employees access clipboard 
content and share resources and files on the device. As security professionals, how do 
we assess the potential risks of such applications, and have processes to assess and 
respond at scale?
6
2023 Global Mobile Threat Report
The fundamental question is this: “How do organizations realize the potential of mobile-powered initiatives without 
jeopardizing the integrity of the business?” (In other words, how do they solve the Vulnerability Gap?)
The level and scope of risk continues to increase and evolve. At the same time, resources within organizations enabled to address 
mobile threats and complexities are in short supply. The result is a “Vulnerability Gap” that jeopardizes mobile-powered businesses 
with blind spots and an exponentially increasing number of exposure points.
![Vulnerability Gap Diagram]
We believe there are five key principles to a complete, scalable, and 
effective mobile-first security strategy:
Five Key Principles of a Mobile-First Security Strategy
Zimperium has helped thousands of enterprises and government agencies around the world answer that 
important question of how to solve the Vulnerability Gap. From over a decade of experience, we know 
that the answer lies in having policies and controls addressing the challenges with a Mobile-First Security 
Strategy—a strategy that accounts for all of the complexities and realities of mobile devices, apps, users, 
and business models; one that supports and enables mobile-powered initiatives and enables users and 
productivity rather than slowing them down or constricting them.

2023 Global Mobile Threat Report
1. **Prioritize and assess risk as close to the user or point of entry as possible.** Organizations need to prioritize securing mobile-
powered business initiatives across all mobile devices and apps.
2. **Operate in a known state - visibility and vulnerability assessment for all your entry points.** Gain complete visibility of your 
mobile ecosystem and risk level. Automatically assess vulnerabilities and address them—without throttling productivity. Establish 
safeguards that are measurable, auditable, and insurable.
3. **Enhance your detection and response strategy for mobile.** Detect anomalies and prioritize remediations based on contextual 
intelligence—so the most critical gaps get addressed first. Embed security across the device and application lifecycle, provide risk-
based response, and enable zero trust assessment of mobile endpoints.
4. **Start the autonomous journey.** Dynamically respond to ever-changing threats and mobile ecosystems. Automatically isolate 
compromised devices and untrusted environments. Establish a proactive, resilient, and scalable security posture.
5. **Minimize risk compliance failures.** Stay ahead of regulations, data sovereignty and privacy standards, while respecting 
employees’ work/life boundaries.
Let's Get Practical
There’s no turning back. The mobile-powered business is here to stay. Given that reality, what are some practical steps that 
security teams can take? Here are some key questions to consider:
Corporate Device and Application Usage Considerations
When developing your strategy to protect mobile devices and assessing the apps they contain, consider the following questions: 
- How are you baselining your initial mobile device risk posture for both managed and unmanaged devices and responding dynamically to elevated risk?
- How many mobile devices are accessing your corporate assets that are unmanaged or without visibility?
- What is your strategy for BYO devices and unmanaged applications?
- What are your zero trust initiatives, and where does mobile fit?
- What is your vision for consolidating mobile security telemetry as part of your data lake and extended detection and response (XDR) strategies?
- Organizations often have a solid strategy for email phishing attacks - How do you reduce risk, measure, and respond to mobile phishing attacks?
- What is your strategy for mobile ransomware and spyware?
- How are you assessing the potential risk of publicly available applications on your managed and unmanaged devices?
- How are you addressing local privacy and data laws and compliance needs across your mobile assets (devices and apps)? 
A Real World Example
A great example of a well- considered Mobile-First Security Strategy is that of a major international organization who, prior to working with 
Zimperium, had a restrictive mobile security strategy where all devices, regardless of corporate- owned or BYOD, were required to be 
enrolled into UEM for device management. This caused friction with BYOD end users. Due to the lack of visibility to vulnerability and risk, 
they only supported a small subset of handset vendors that were approved for BYOD use.
By leveraging mobile threat defense (Key Principle #1), the organization gained better visibility into its risk posture and enabled the 
adoption of a broader range of device models & manufacturers. This allowed the organization to accelerate its BYOD strategy- while 
providing real-time insights into the risks on those devices (Key Principles #2 and #3). It also gave them the ability to provide and deliver 
automated response (Key Principle #4) without compromising security. 
As a result, the bank has been able to achieve the vision of its mobile-powered initiative without security impacts. This is exactly how a 
Mobile-First Security Strategy should work in real life.
The same organization was able to leverage the Zimperium Mobile Application Protection Suite (MAPS) to provide runtime security insight 
to their mobile application (Key Principles #1, #2, and #3), as many of their customers were being targeted for scams/fraud via social 
engineering and malicious app installation. With the implementation of security telemetry inside their consumer banking app, they can now 
gain visibility to the risks, and automatically respond to them within the app (Key Principle #4). All of this can be accomplished while 
ensuring that they meet compliance and data sovereignty requirements (Key Principle #5). 
As a result, the organization has been able to achieve its vision of its mobile-powered initiative, reducing risk- and providing visibility, 
actionable insights, and automated response.onsider the following questions:

2023 Global Mobile Threat Report
Security Considerations as a Mobile User and 
Consumer
As users of mobile devices, there are some key steps you can 
take that will help reduce risk for both your device and the data 
that you use:
- Apply security patches whenever available for your device.
- Disable developer configurations on the device unless actively 
developing. Keep a separate developer device for this use case.
- Prefer apps from known, approved stores over third-party ones.
- Ensure that operating systems and apps are automatically 
updating. Vulnerabilities are often addressed in updates as well 
as new features added.
- Check and consider permissions apps are requesting at 
download and when running.
- Read the reviews on apps before installing. If there are 
complaints of suspicious behaviors, be wary of installation.
- Leverage external app review services, if available, to provide 
risk or privacy visibility prior to downloading. 
- Avoid public Wi-Fi usage. If you must use them, leverage a VPN 
to encrypt traffic.
- Leverage SMS and malicious URL and phishing protection 
solutions.  As the report will highlight, this is a significant vector 
of attack that needs robust, immediate solutions.
Mobile Application Development Considerations 
When developing applications internally, or if applications are 
developed for your organization by third parties, consider the 
following questions:
- Often organizations are using external services for application 
review - typically, security flaws are assessed. Knowing that 
development teams release versions of apps one to four times 
a month, how do you deliver assurance of security at scale 
without impacting development performance?
- How are you assessing privacy and compliance issues of the 
applications you are releasing?
- Are your apps using code obfuscation or integrity checking? 
How are you attempting to thwart reverse engineering?
- How well do your app protection approaches score when 
compared against Open Worldwide Application Security 
Project (OWASP), Mobile Application Security Verification 
Standard (MASVS), National Information Assurance 
Partnership (NIAP), or Mobile Payments on COTS (MPoC) 
standards?
- How are you assessing the risk posture of the devices your app 
is running on (beyond using simplistic open- source jailbreak or 
root detection to “tick the box”)?  What security logic do you 
have in place to make decisions around device attestation?
o How do you keep up to date with new tool coverage?
- How are you giving security or SOC teams visibility into the 
attacks, and providing forensics to use as part of a greater 
security workflow?
- How will you attest the security mechanisms in place to 
auditors?
- An average mobile application has several externally 
developed software development kits (SDKs).  Do you feel you 
have a robust workflow for identifying risks due to third-party 
SDK usage? 
The 2023 Global

## 1.3: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Mobile Security
Nico Chiaraviglio, Chief Scientist at Zimperium
In 1977, the first West Coast Computer Fair was held. During the fair, Ted Nelson gave an exposition titled, “Those unforgettable next two 
years,”, highlighting the explosion of personal computers that was about to occur. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), we are now 
experiencing a new version of those “unforgettable next two years.”. Unless you were living completely off the grid, you’ve probably heard 
of and perhaps even interacted with ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot implementing a language model trained on the 
whole corpus of human knowledge. Early assessments show that ChatGPT is capable of solving almost any language-oriented task—
unless that task is math related (just like for many actual people, math is AI’s least favorite subject). Furthermore, a recent paper from 
Microsoft claims that ChatGPT-4 is showing sparks of artificial general intelligence.
ChatGPT is only one of many AI milestones in recent years. Last year, there was  a succession of milestones:
- Google’s LaMDA emerged as the first AI system to pass the Turing test. 
- Several developments in scientific fields with DeepMind models for protein folding and matrix multiplication. 
- Advances in text-to-image and text-to-video with OpenAI’s DALL-E and Meta’s Make-A-Video models.
- New successes in speech-to-speech translation, among several other fields.
Why AI is Such a Game-Changer in Cybersecurity
AI is also revolutionizing cybersecurity, demonstrating its facility as the most effective way for organizations to adapt to an evolving 
threat landscape. AI is such a great leap forward because it can automate and perform tasks such as threat detection, vulnerability 
management, and network monitoring, to name a few. While not always given due credit in the media, the value of AI has been evident 
for many years. Perhaps the best example of this is the email spam filter, which has existed since 1996. 
Since Zimperium’s inception, AI has been at the core of its technology and 
innovation, being the only mobile threat defense (MTD) provider that can 
run machine learning models on device to perform a myriad of tasks such 
as detecting malware, phishing, system exploits, network 
reconnaissance, jailbreak/rooting, and system anomalies. Our models are 
constantly evolving to adapt to changing threats and are updated 
continuously to deliver peak performance. 
Due to its high efficiency and privacy-centric approach, Zimperium’s 
detection capabilities are protecting residents of Los Angeles, New York, 
Dallas, and Michigan; students and educators at K-12 institutions; and 
devices of the U.S. Department of Defense and thousands of enterprise 
organizations around the world. At the same time, Zimperium has 
partnered with Google as part of its App Defense Alliance to keep malware 
out of the Play Store. 
AI innovation won’t stop in 2023; it will accelerate, and Zimperium will be 
at the forefront of the process.

## 1.4: The Way Forward for Unmanaged Devices
Jim Taylor, Chief Product Officer, RSA
The best code you’ll ever write is the code you write with your customers. That’s what happened in 2022, when one of our customers—
and one of the world’s largest financial services organizations—told us they had a problem: they needed to secure users’ unmanaged 
devices. 
This need wasn’t unique to this customer, or even to financial services generally. The global pandemic, financial headwinds, and remote 
work have all made unmanaged devices a fixture of the work-from-anywhere economy. Organizations don’t want to pay for every 
cellphone, laptop, and tablet. Employees don’t want their employers to install software on their phones. 
While unmanaged devices may help an organization’s bottom line, they still come at a high cost. By their very nature, unmanaged 
devices aren’t as secure as managed hardware. And threat actors are taking notice: Verizon’s 2022 Mobile Security Index found that 
mobile-related compromise had doubled from 2021 to 2022. About one-fifth of successful phishing emails come from mobile devices, 
per the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report.  
And it’s not just that organizations are encountering more 
breaches—it’s that those breaches have an even deeper impact: 
> 73%
> of organizations that 
> experienced a mobile-related 
> compromise described it as a 
> “major” breach.
73% of organizations that experienced a mobile-related 
compromise described it as a “major” breach. The 2022 IBM 
Cost of a Data Breach Report found that “costs where remote 
working was a factor in causing a breach” were roughly $1 million 
more than when employees were on site.  
Have Cake, Eat it Too
Unmanaged devices expand the attack surface, are inherently less secure than managed hardware, and are still a necessary part of 
doing business. Our customer wanted to have their cybersecurity cake and eat the cost savings, too. At the same time, cybercriminals 
wanted to poison the cake, burn down the kitchen, and ransom the recipes. 
We found a way forward by working with Zimperium to develop RSA Mobile Lock, which prevents risks and detects on-device threats.
 Mobile Lock is automatically deployed as part of the RSA Authenticator App—it’s not a second app that users need to manage. Once 
installed, Mobile Lock scans for critical risks like jailbroken devices, suspicious apps, elevation of privileges, man-in-the-middle attacks, 
and other threats. If it detects a threat, Mobile Lock restricts users from using the RSA Authenticator. When it detects a threat, Mobile 
Lock leaves all other systems on the device unaffected—a user can still call, text, connect to the Internet and, ideally, contact their IT 
department to resolve the issue. 
Mobile Lock addressed our customer’s problem—they can now establish trust in unmanaged mobile devices. Since launching the 
solution in October 2022, we’re seeing early signs of massive uptake in the solution, with additional customers in healthcare, 
manufacturing and supply chain, and other financial services adopting Mobile Lock.

2023 Global Mobile Threat Report
The Right Thing—Not Everything
The growing number of unmanaged devices is a major accelerant driving explosive growth in the attack surface: increasing users, 
entitlements, and environments are making larger, more interconnected, and more vulnerable IT universes. 
Zimperium’s Global Mobile Threat Report and some of the highest-profile breaches in recent memory—including Colonial Pipeline, 
SolarWinds, and LAPSUS$—demonstrate how threat actors are successfully exploiting that growth. Zimperium’s observation that the 
volume and sophistication of attacks are increasing significantly is absolutely correct. 
If anything, that’s putting it too lightly. There’s simply too much spread across too many fragmented security solutions for humans to 
process at speed or scale. Today, I can’t expect my security team to review everything—instead, I need them to prioritize the right thing. 
And the only way to do that is with automated intelligence solutions that find the signal in the noise, triage risks, and automate 
responses.
Our initial version of Mobile Lock was a great start at delivering those capabilities, but it was just a start. Cybersecurity’s way forward 
demands a comprehensive approach that ingests signals, risks, and threats across the entire IT estate and at every stage of the identity 
lifecycle. The next version of Mobile Lock will do just that: it will review a broader array of signals, risks, and threats and build that 
intelligence into a broader security fabric. 
Mobile Lock v1 solved the last problem—Mobile Lock v2 will get ahead of the next problem. That’s right where our customers need us 
to be.

## 2.1: Zimperium zLabs: 2023 Research Highlights
The Zimperium zLabs Advanced Research Group continuously 
investigates mobile device and application threats targeting users 
worldwide. 
The zLabs team detected an average of 77,000 unique malware 
samples every month in 2022. Between 2021 and 2022, the team 
saw the total number of malware samples rise by 51%, with more 
than 920,000 samples detected. 
The following is an overview of some of the most high-profile discoveries made by the 
zLabs team.
Dirty RatMilad: Android Spyware
Mobile spyware is no longer just the domain of sophisticated government surveillance 
teams and nation states. RatMilad is just one example of how this type of spyware is 
being employed by smaller organizations. This malware (which has various spyware 
capabilities such as data exfiltration techniques) has taken various forms. The original 
variant of RatMilad was hidden within a phone number spoofing app called Text Me, 
an app that purported to help users verify a social media account by phone. In the fall 
of 2022, zLabs discovered a live sample of RatMilad hidden within an app called
