## Executive Summary

Disruption, transformation, volatility —
whichever keyword fits your style, it all
points to one fact: change is the constant
security teams have had to live by for
years. In 2020, the pandemic stress-tested
their ability to keep data secure during the
global WFH movement. In 2021 and 2022,
The Great Resignation exacerbated talent
shortages and slowed down vulnerability
management. And this year, business pivots,
restructures, and hiring freezes dominate
the news and security teams’ minds – how
do they keep assets secure with fewer
resources and more responsibilities?

For our 5th edition of The State of
Pentesting, we explore three key areas:

*   The most prevalent security
    vulnerabilities in over 3,100 pentests
    completed in 2022 with the help of the
    Cobalt Core — our community of highly
    skilled and vetted pentesters;
*   How macroeconomic shifts are
    affecting organizations’ security
    standards across the US and EMEA,
    and;
*   How teams can avoid business
    disruptions, extract more value from
    their pentests, and maximize ROI;

Top 5 most prevalent security issues

1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
2.  Outdated Software Versions
3.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
4.  Lack of Security Headers
5.  Insecure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) Protocols

Most Common Findings with Critical Severity

1.  SQL Injection
2.  Remote Code Execution
3.  Using Default Credentials

Most Common Findings with High Severity

1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  SQL Injection

Most Common Findings with High Severity

1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

A note on severity levels: Cobalt uses the OWASP Risk Rating
methodology while calculating the severity of any reported finding.
Where the application resides, what level of privilege is required,
requirement for user interaction, business impact and many other
factors which vary business to business determine a finding’s exploit
likelihood and impact. Hence, some findings will appear as the most
common flaws for multiple risk levels.

What’s Lurking in Your Systems?

The most common vulnerabilities from over 3,100 pentests.

### Server Security Misconfigurations continue to dominate.

This year, nearly 40% of our findings were related to Server Security Misconfigurations,
with the most common issues being Lack of Security Headers, Insecure Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cipher Suites, and Fingerprinting/Banner
Disclosure.

Other vulnerabilities we saw spanned across the following categories: Cross-Site Scripting
(nearly 12% of total findings), Sensitive Data Exposure (10%), Broken Access Control (10%),
and Authentication & Sessions (9%).

In fact, Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was our most common finding for 2022, with the
vast majority of discovered flaws earning a Medium or High severity level. Any feature that
allows user input can be vulnerable, because it gives attackers an opportunity to inject and
store malicious content into web applications. To prevent this, Cobalt recommends treating
all user-supplied input as untrusted data and accepting input in select locations. We also
recommend using a well-known and secure encoding API for input and output encoding,
such as the OWASP ESAPI.

Another common high-impact flaw are Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), with
Cobalt Core pentesters marking 85% as either Critical, High, or Medium severity. This
vulnerability can give access to resources via user-supplied input, where attackers bypass
authorization by modifying a value of a parameter that points directly to an object in your
database. Use per-user or per-session indirect object references. Each time your application
uses a direct object reference from an untrusted source, it should also make an access
control check to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested object.

Finally, a vulnerability we saw more of in 2022 compared to previous years is the use of
Outdated Software Versions. When it takes dozens of apps and programs to keep a website,
product, or business running, staying on top of updates for all of them can quickly spiral out
of control. Despite this vulnerability having a reputation as a low-risk issue, our pentesters
marked it as Critical, High, or Medium severity 14% of the time.

Most common findings per vulnerability category.

Cross-Site Scripting

*   Stored XSS
*   Reflected XSS

Sensitive Data Exposure

*   Visible Detailed Error/Debug Page

### Stored XSS and IDOR introduce high levels of risk.

As we work with customers to improve their security posture, we observe fewer and fewer
vulnerabilities marked as high, medium, or critical severity. The majority of our 2022 findings
were on the lower end of the risk scale, with nearly 60% being Low severity.

And yet, teams need to remain vigilant. In 2022 we discovered more than 16,000 findings,
and while the majority posed minimal impact, two of the three most repetitive flaws —
Stored Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Direct Object References — had the potential for
serious damage, with pentesters marking them frequently as Medium or High severity. We
recommend proactively checking for these flaws, whether through internal reviews or via a
targeted pentest.

*   **Critical**: Includes vulnerabilities such as administrative access, remote code
    execution, financial theft, and more.
*   **High**: Includes high probability vulnerabilities with a high business impact.
*   **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that are “Medium risk <> Medium impact,” “Low risk <>

### A large portion of vulnerabilities
remain unaddressed at each
severity level.

As we help customers remediate vulnerabilities, we can observe how teams react to these
findings. The scenarios we see are:

*   Teams fix the finding and request a retest to confirm if the fix is working correctly
    (i.e. validate). Note that we offer retests on discovered findings for free, so there
    is no financial barrier.
*   Teams mark the finding as “Accepted Risk” because its severity level doesn’t
    meet their remediation threshold, or a compromising control is in place.
*   Teams don’t request a retest. The finding could have been remediated, but a
    retest hasn’t checked whether their fix is working. Alternatively, it’s staying in
    their backlogs for an indefinite period of time.

At the time of writing this report, customers had remediated, retested, and confirmed as
fixed 25% of the findings we discovered in 2022. That number changes depending on a
finding’s criticality and the customer’s company size.

For example, smaller companies of up to 50 employees have retested and fixed a sizeably
larger portion of their vulnerabilities compared to larger organizations, although that figure
does drop considerably with lower-risk findings. This is a trend we observe across the board,
which in one part should not come as a surprise — teams have to prioritize, but they do
leave themselves vulnerable to chained exploits from lower-risk findings.

What gives us pause is that just 61% of critical vulnerabilities in our database, regardless
of company size, have been confirmed as fixed. That number drops to as low as 31%
for medium-severity findings. This suggests a considerable security gap — despite their
pentests, many organizations still remain at risk of a successful attack. In the next section,
we dig deeper into what might be holding them back from strengthening their security
postures.

## PART 2
# From Micro to Macro

How layoffs and budget cuts are impacting security teams’ work.

10

### Layoffs and budget cuts are prevalent in the US,
applying more pressure compared to Europe.

Our data shows that, following the pressures of the pandemic-fueled Great Resignation in
2021, security teams now face additional industry headwinds. High employee turnover and
scant bandwidth still hamstring productivity, with mounting pressure to restructure and cut
costs amidst speculation of a downturn.

To best understand how security teams fare against these larger economic trends, we
surveyed 1006 professionals in the field: 501 in the US, and 505 in the UK & Germany. To
limit the scope of our research to the US felt shortsighted, and so we chose additional
countries in an effort to better represent the global community (and hope to continue the
shift in future reports).

In the US, three-fourths of respondents share that their department had been directly
impacted by company layoffs in the last six months. Roughly the same number (72%) said
someone from their team had also resigned, and more than half expect further firings. In
addition, the majority have been affected by hiring freezes (66%) or recruitment slowdowns
(67%).

In the UK and Germany, we see a very different picture. Only one-fourth said their team had
been affected by layoffs, less than half (44%) said a security colleague had resigned, and
less than a third (29%) expect layoffs in 2023. However, the majority (61%) reported their
company has announced a recruitment slowdown for 2023.

In the finance realm, just 28% of UK and German respondents shared their budgets had
been cut. That figure was more than double for the US, and we see the same trend when
comparing how large the cuts had been on average: 31% for the US, and 16% for the UK and
Germany.

The contrast is striking, and it’s challenging to pin this to one specific reason. Many factors
can be at play, including differences in labor laws, fiscal strategies, and previous hiring
decisions. But cybersecurity more often than not works as one large global ecosystem,
where one breach can affect many — it’s safe to say it’s being put under considerable
pressure.

To ensure unbiased
results, no respondents

### Many of the affected teams
struggle to maintain high
security standards.

Where the similarities begin is how layoffs and budget cuts are impacting security
teams’ work. The vast majority of affected teams report their workloads have become
unmanageable, and both sides struggle equally with maintaining security at a high enough
standard.

Not only that, but a large portion of affected US respondents (73%, 15 points higher than
UK & DE) shared they’re struggling to monitor and respond to vulnerabilities and incidents.
Their top-of-mind concerns are Sensitive data exposure, Server security misconfigurations,
and Network security misconfigurations.

Teams in the UK and Germany have similar concerns, though they ranked Insecure data
storage higher (see next page).

### Fewer resources lead to
more and more unaddressed
vulnerabilities.

In the US, 89% of affected teams struggle to collaborate with their dev counterparts, whereas
in the UK and Germany 59% reported this problem — 30 points lower than the US, but still a
sizable portion.

Both sides complained equally that their dev teams show a lack of urgency in fixing
vulnerabilities. For the US, this led to nearly all (96%) of affected respondents saying
critical vulnerabilities get fixed more slowly, and more than three-fourths reported the same
problem for high- and medium-severity vulnerabilities. Alarmingly, 76% said their backlog of
unaddressed bugs increased in 2022 due to lack of resources, and 82% said they expect this
problem to only worsen.

In the UK and Germany, teams were not as pessimistic, but the picture wasn’t much
improved. 79% shared that their dev team was slower to remediate critical vulnerabilities,
and 65% expect the problem to worsen in 2023.

### US teams plan to lean
much more on third parties
compared to their European
counterparts.

When it comes to how teams will move forward, US respondents plan to outsource more
work compared to 2022. At the top of their outsource list are addressing discovered
vulnerabilities, vendor security reviews, and pursuing optional compliance certifications, e.g.,
SOC 2 or ISO 27001 (see next page).

As far as what they plan to deprioritize: the top projects to go are implementing DevSecOps
practices (interestingly, UK and DE respondents plan to continue pursuing this through
outsourcing), hiring, and adopting new technology.

In the UK and Germany, respondents are leaning more towards deprioritizing (66%).
Less time and fewer resources will go into adopting new technology, hiring, and personal
development.

Deprioritizing business-critical projects can be a dangerous move:
on one hand, you’re trying to protect your team from burnout, but
on the other, you’re creating more opportunity for vulnerabilities to
materialize or stay unaddressed, compromising the defenses around
your organization. It’s a tough balance to strike, and sometimes
doing it alone is not the answer. A good external team can help
balance the scales.”

### Teams struggle with preparing for their pentests and
experience business disruptions.

Most security teams did between one and three pentests in 2022, but a much more sizable
portion in the UK and Germany did more than six pentests.

In the UK and Germany, fewer complained of these challenges, but where they did struggle is
preparing their environment accurately for the test.

In the US, compliance was the most common goal (48% selected, see next page), followed
by fulfilling customer requests, and testing new features in their application.

The top objectives in the UK and Germany were checking for specific vulnerabilities (66%
selected), fulfilling a compliance requirement, and testing for cloud misconfigurations.

With time and resources in short supply, every pentest should deliver results quickly with
no disruption to infrastructure. That, however, is not the case. More than half (62%) of
US respondents said engagements with different vendors had disrupted their business
operations, and 66% shared they had had to do unexpected clean-up after the test (not
counting fixing vulnerabilities the tests had discovered).

Teams are under pressure to achieve more with less, and an unproductive, disruptive pentest
does not help them get closer to their goals. Your pentesting vendor should take charge and
ensure tests run smoothly, but that’s not to say things are entirely out of your control. In the
next part of the report, we share practical steps on how to prepare for each test and extract
maximum value, guided by insights from the Cobalt Core — our community of 400+ skilled
and vetted pentesting professionals.

## PART 3
# Set Up Your Pentests for Success

Recommendations from Cobalt’s pentesters on how to prepare and maximize ROI.

20

### Set up the pentest for success with a
clear objective and accurate scope.

Out of the 3,100 pentests we did in 2022, the top areas that slowed the process down were:

*   Testers lacking credentials or necessary access before the test starts
*   Scope misalignment
*   No active collaboration throughout the test
*   Missing brief/asset information

We’ll go over how your team can tackle each of these items, but let’s start at the beginning: setting an objective
and scoping the test correctly. Most of the time, unclear details in this stage are what leads to misalignments
and business disruptions later on.

Start with a clear, achievable objective. Before you kick off your next pentest, align internally on what you want
it to achieve, what needs to get tested, and are there areas testers should prioritize. It’s important to do as
much of this as you can before you kick things off with your vendor, because pentests are typically a time-bound
exercise; once the clock starts ticking, clearing up details will cost you valuable time and resources.

A clear objective leads to an accurate scope, and an accurate scope means more targeted pentests. One of
the first things that should happen when you approach your pentest vendor is to confirm your desired scope.
To give pentesters the chance to test in depth, you should provide more than your application’s URL or how
many static/dynamic pages it has. Consider including more insight into the complexity of your asset, answering
questions like:

*   How many functionalities does your app support?
*   What third-party services does your app call?
*   How many user roles are there, or how many should the testers focus on?
*   Are there any unique setup requirements pentesters should fulfill to follow your internal processes?
    (e.g. setting up MFA, dummy credentials, signing NDAs, etc.)

Having this information will help your vendor correctly estimate how many testers need to join the project,
what skills are required, and how long the engagement should take. If not shared in the preparation stage, this
information will still come up — only later, once the pentest has already started and hours go into recalibrating
the project instead of analyzing your assets.

If your internal stakeholders’ expectations contradict each
other, you may end up starting a white- or gray-box test,
only to have to change it to a black-box exercise halfway
through. The testers will no longer be in the right mindset
and that will hurt results. Take 2-3 days to get everything
aligned internally, and you’ll have a much more productive
pentest.“

Tracy Harper

Lead Technical Project Manager at Cobalt

To-do list before the
test starts:

1.  Align all internal stakeholders on what the goal of
    your pentest is and what assets should be in scope
    — then communicate this information to your vendor.
2.  Describe the in-scope assets with information on
    endpoints, URLs, number of static and dynamic
    pages, etc.
3.  Include information on the complexity of your asset,
    covering the questions we suggest on this page for
    a more accurate scope — if you want a black-box
    test, these details don’t have to reach the pentesters
    joining your project, but your vendor should still be
    aware in order to staff appropriately.

21

### Familiarize the pentesters with how
things are supposed to work.

Sometimes your goal will be to simulate an external attack through a black-box pentest, and there’s definitely
value in that exercise. However, it’s important to note that no black-box pentest will perfectly simulate an
external attacker. Pentests are time-bound, whereas externals can have unlimited time for reconnaissance.
What’s more, insider threats can be just as destructive. To capture more scenarios, we recommend a gray- or
white-box pentest, where testers have access to documentation outlining setup, business logic, and internal
knowledge.

Documentation gets the testers quickly up to speed and can range from diagrams to walkthrough videos to
data flow charts — it all depends on how your asset is set up. For example, say you’re pentesting for PCI DSS
compliance: when testers know how you meant to segment your cardholder data environment from the rest of
your systems, they can confirm whether that is in fact working correctly and can withstand attacks.

Documentation doesn’t just make testers’ lives easier — it also makes your findings more accurate,
particularly their severity levels. When testers know the context around your assets and operations, they’re
able to determine a finding’s likelihood and impact much more accurately, in a way that’s customized to your
