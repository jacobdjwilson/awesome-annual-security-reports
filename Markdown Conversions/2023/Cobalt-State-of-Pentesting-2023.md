# State of Pentesting 2023 Report

## Executive Summary

Disruption, transformation, volatility — whichever keyword fits your style, it all points to one fact: change is the constant security teams have had to live by for years. In 2020, the pandemic stress-tested their ability to keep data secure during the global WFH movement. In 2021 and 2022, The Great Resignation exacerbated talent shortages and slowed down vulnerability management. And this year, business pivots, restructures, and hiring freezes dominate the news and security teams’ minds – how do they keep assets secure with fewer resources and more responsibilities?

For our 5th edition of The State of Pentesting, we explore three key areas:

*   The most prevalent security vulnerabilities in over 3,100 pentests completed in 2022 with the help of the Cobalt Core — our community of highly skilled and vetted pentesters;
*   How macroeconomic shifts are affecting organizations’ security standards across the US and EMEA, and;
*   How teams can avoid business disruptions, extract more value from their pentests, and maximize ROI;

### Top 5 most prevalent security issues
1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
2.  Outdated Software Versions
3.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
4.  Lack of Security Headers
5.  Insecure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocols

### Most Common Findings with Critical Severity
1.  SQL Injection
2.  Remote Code Execution
3.  Using Default Credentials

### Most Common Findings with High Severity
1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  SQL Injection

### Most Common Findings with Medium Severity
1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

A note on severity levels: Cobalt uses the OWASP Risk Rating methodology while calculating the severity of any reported finding. Where the application resides, what level of privilege is required, requirement for user interaction, business impact and many other factors which vary business to business determine a finding’s exploit likelihood and impact. Hence, some findings will appear as the most common flaws for multiple risk levels.

## PART 1
# XSS, IDOR, or SQL Injection —
What’s Lurking in Your Systems?

The most common vulnerabilities from over 3,100 pentests.

### Server Security Misconfigurations continue to dominate.

This year, nearly 40% of our findings were related to Server Security Misconfigurations, with the most common issues being Lack of Security Headers, Insecure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Cipher Suites, and Fingerprinting/Banner Disclosure.

Other vulnerabilities we saw spanned across the following categories: Cross-Site Scripting (nearly 12% of total findings), Sensitive Data Exposure (10%), Broken Access Control (10%), and Authentication & Sessions (9%).

In fact, Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was our most common finding for 2022, with the vast majority of discovered flaws earning a Medium or High severity level. Any feature that allows user input can be vulnerable, because it gives attackers an opportunity to inject and store malicious content into web applications. To prevent this, Cobalt recommends treating all user-supplied input as untrusted data and accepting input in select locations. We also recommend using a well-known and secure encoding API for input and output encoding, such as the OWASP ESAPI.

Another common high-impact flaw are Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), with Cobalt Core pentesters marking 85% as either Critical, High, or Medium severity. This vulnerability can give access to resources via user-supplied input, where attackers bypass authorization by modifying a value of a parameter that points directly to an object in your database. Use per-user or per-session indirect object references. Each time your application uses a direct object reference from an untrusted source, it should also make an access control check to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested object.

Finally, a vulnerability we saw more of in 2022 compared to previous years is the use of Outdated Software Versions. When it takes dozens of apps and programs to keep a website, product, or business running, staying on top of updates for all of them can quickly spiral out of control. Despite this vulnerability having a reputation as a low-risk issue, our pentesters marked it as Critical, High, or Medium severity 14% of the time.

### Most common findings per vulnerability category.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting**
    *   Stored XSS
    *   Reflected XSS
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure**
    *   Visible Detailed Error/Debug Page
    *   Disclosure of Known Public Information
    *   Sensitive Token in URL
*   **Broken Access Control**
    *   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery
    *   Username/Email enumeration
*   **Authentication & Sessions**
    *   Failure to Invalidate Sessions
    *   Privilege Escalation
    *   Concurrent Logins

### The top 10 vulnerabilities
in the last two years.

### Stored XSS and IDOR introduce high levels of risk.

As we work with customers to improve their security posture, we observe fewer and fewer vulnerabilities marked as high, medium, or critical severity. The majority of our 2022 findings were on the lower end of the risk scale, with nearly 60% being Low severity.

![Graph showing the distribution of vulnerability severity levels from 2020 to 2022.](image_description)

And yet, teams need to remain vigilant. In 2022 we discovered more than 16,000 findings, and while the majority posed minimal impact, two of the three most repetitive flaws — Stored Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Direct Object References — had the potential for serious damage, with pentesters marking them frequently as Medium or High severity. We recommend proactively checking for these flaws, whether through internal reviews or via a targeted pentest.

### Most Common
Findings with
Critical Severity
1.  SQL Injection
2.  Remote Code Execution
3.  Using Default Credentials

### Most Common
Findings with
High Severity
1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  SQL Injection

### Most Common
Findings with
Medium Severity
1.  Stored Cross-Site Scripting
2.  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
3.  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

A note on severity levels: Cobalt uses the OWASP Risk Rating methodology while calculating the severity of any reported finding. Where the application resides, what level of privilege is required, requirement for user interaction, business impact and many other factors which vary business to business determine a finding’s exploit likelihood and impact. Hence, some findings will appear as the most common flaws for multiple risk levels.

*   **Critical**: Includes vulnerabilities such as administrative access, remote code execution, financial theft, and more.
*   **High**: Includes high probability vulnerabilities with a high business impact.
*   **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that are “Medium risk <> Medium impact,” “Low risk <> High impact,” or “High risk <> Low impact.”
*   **Low**: Specifies common vulnerabilities with minimal impact on their own, but possibly dangerous if chained.
*   **Informational**: Notes vulnerabilities of minimal risk to your business.

### Top vulnerabilities for
different asset types.

**Web App**
*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Outdated Software Version
*   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
*   Lack of Security Headers
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**API**
*   Lack of Security Headers
*   Descriptive Stack Trace
*   No Rate Limiting on Form
*   Fingerprinting / Banner Disclosure
*   Insecure Cipher Suite

**Mobile App**
*   Lack of Jailbreak Detection
*   Screen Caching Enabled
*   Absent SSL Certificate Pinning
*   User Password Persisted in Memory
*   Lack of Obfuscation

**Internal Network**
*   Outdated Software Version
*   Using Default Credentials
*   Insecure SSL and TLS Protocols
*   Insecure Cipher Suite
*   Fingerprinting / Banner Disclosure

**External Network**
*   Insecure SSL and TLS Protocols
*   Outdated Software Version
*   Fingerprinting / Banner Disclosure
*   Insecure Cipher Suite
*   Using Default Credentials

**Cloud Configurations** (all data since 2017)
*   Outdated Software Version
*   Sensitive Application Data Stored Unencrypted
*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Weak Password Policy
*   Non-Sensitive Application Data Stored Unencrypted

### A large portion of vulnerabilities
remain unaddressed at each
severity level.

As we help customers remediate vulnerabilities, we can observe how teams react to these findings. The scenarios we see are:

*   Teams fix the finding and request a retest to confirm if the fix is working correctly (i.e. validate). Note that we offer retests on discovered findings for free, so there is no financial barrier.
*   Teams mark the finding as “Accepted Risk” because its severity level doesn’t meet their remediation threshold, or a compromising control is in place.
*   Teams don’t request a retest. The finding could have been remediated, but a retest hasn’t checked whether their fix is working. Alternatively, it’s staying in their backlogs for an indefinite period of time.

At the time of writing this report, customers had remediated, retested, and confirmed as fixed 25% of the findings we discovered in 2022. That number changes depending on a finding’s criticality and the customer’s company size.

For example, smaller companies of up to 50 employees have retested and fixed a sizeably larger portion of their vulnerabilities compared to larger organizations, although that figure does drop considerably with lower-risk findings. This is a trend we observe across the board, which in one part should not come as a surprise — teams have to prioritize, but they do leave themselves vulnerable to chained exploits from lower-risk findings.

What gives us pause is that just 61% of critical vulnerabilities in our database, regardless of company size, have been confirmed as fixed. That number drops to as low as 31% for medium-severity findings. This suggests a considerable security gap — despite their pentests, many organizations still remain at risk of a successful attack. In the next section, we dig deeper into what might be holding them back from strengthening their security postures.

## PART 2
# From Micro to Macro

How layoffs and budget cuts are impacting security teams’ work.

### Layoffs and budget cuts are prevalent in the US,
applying more pressure compared to Europe.

Our data shows that, following the pressures of the pandemic-fueled Great Resignation in 2021, security teams now face additional industry headwinds. High employee turnover and scant bandwidth still hamstring productivity, with mounting pressure to restructure and cut costs amidst speculation of a downturn.

To best understand how security teams fare against these larger economic trends, we surveyed 1006 professionals in the field: 501 in the US, and 505 in the UK & Germany. To limit the scope of our research to the US felt shortsighted, and so we chose additional countries in an effort to better represent the global community (and hope to continue the shift in future reports).

In the US, three-fourths of respondents share that their department had been directly impacted by company layoffs in the last six months. Roughly the same number (72%) said someone from their team had also resigned, and more than half expect further firings. In addition, the majority have been affected by hiring freezes (66%) or recruitment slowdowns (67%).

In the UK and Germany, we see a very different picture. Only one-fourth said their team had been affected by layoffs, less than half (44%) said a security colleague had resigned, and less than a third (29%) expect layoffs in 2023. However, the majority (61%) reported their company has announced a recruitment slowdown for 2023.

In the finance realm, just 28% of UK and German respondents shared their budgets had been cut. That figure was more than double for the US, and we see the same trend when comparing how large the cuts had been on average: 31% for the US, and 16% for the UK and Germany.

The contrast is striking, and it’s challenging to pin this to one specific reason. Many factors can be at play, including differences in labor laws, fiscal strategies, and previous hiring decisions. But cybersecurity more often than not works as one large global ecosystem, where one breach can affect many — it’s safe to say it’s being put under considerable pressure.

To ensure unbiased
results, no respondents
were Cobalt customers.

![Bar chart comparing the impact of layoffs and budget cuts on cybersecurity practitioners in the US vs. UK & Germany.](image_description)

### Many of the affected teams
struggle to maintain high
security standards.

Where the similarities begin is how layoffs and budget cuts are impacting security
teams’ work. The vast majority of affected teams report their workloads have become
unmanageable, and both sides struggle equally with maintaining security at a high enough
standard.

Not only that, but a large portion of affected US respondents (73%, 15 points higher than
UK & DE) shared they’re struggling to monitor and respond to vulnerabilities and incidents.
Their top-of-mind concerns are Sensitive data exposure, Server security misconfigurations,
and Network security misconfigurations.

Teams in the UK and Germany have similar concerns, though they ranked Insecure data
storage higher (see next page).

![Bar chart comparing the challenges faced by affected security teams in the US vs. UK & Germany.](image_description)

### Which vulnerabilities is your security team
most concerned about?

*   Sensitive Data Exposure
*   Server Security Misconfigurations
*   Network Security Misconfigurations
*   Insecure Data Storage
*   Server-Side Injections
*   Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
*   Broken Access Control
*   Broken Authentication & Session Management
*   Cross-Site Scripting
*   Lack of Binary Hardening
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery

### Fewer resources lead to
more and more unaddressed
vulnerabilities.

In the US, 89% of affected teams struggle to collaborate with their dev counterparts, whereas
in the UK and Germany 59% reported this problem — 30 points lower than the US, but still a
sizable portion.

Both sides complained equally that their dev teams show a lack of urgency in fixing
vulnerabilities. For the US, this led to nearly all (96%) of affected respondents saying
critical vulnerabilities get fixed more slowly, and more than three-fourths reported the same
problem for high- and medium-severity vulnerabilities. Alarmingly, 76% said their backlog of
unaddressed bugs increased in 2022 due to lack of resources, and 82% said they expect this
problem to only worsen.

In the UK and Germany, teams were not as pessimistic, but the picture wasn’t much
improved. 79% shared that their dev team was slower to remediate critical vulnerabilities,
and 65% expect the problem to worsen in 2023.

“Fewer resources led to a backlog of
unaddressed vulnerabilities in 2022.”

76% Agree (US)
65% Agree (UK & DE)

“I expect this problem to worsen in 2023.”

82% Agree (US)
80% Agree (UK & DE)

### US teams plan to lean
much more on third parties
compared to their European
counterparts.

When it comes to how teams will move forward, US respondents plan to outsource more
work compared to 2022. At the top of their outsource list are addressing discovered
vulnerabilities, vendor security reviews, and pursuing optional compliance certifications, e.g.,
SOC 2 or ISO 27001 (see next page).

As far as what they plan to deprioritize: the top projects to go are implementing DevSecOps
practices (interestingly, UK and DE respondents plan to continue pursuing this through
outsourcing), hiring, and adopting new technology.

In the UK and Germany, respondents are leaning more towards deprioritizing (66%).
Less time and fewer resources will go into adopting new technology, hiring, and personal
development.

![Bar chart comparing plans to outsource or deprioritize projects in the US vs. UK & Germany.](image_description)

“Deprioritizing business-critical projects can be a dangerous move: on one hand, you’re trying to protect your team from burnout, but on the other, you’re creating more opportunity for vulnerabilities to materialize or stay unaddressed, compromising the defenses around your organization. It’s a tough balance to strike, and sometimes doing it alone is not the answer. A good external team can help balance the scales.”
— Caroline Wong, Chief Strategy Officer at Cobalt

outsource or deprioritize.

![Pie charts showing what teams in the UK and Germany plan to outsource or deprioritize.](image_description)

### Teams struggle with preparing for their pentests and
experience business disruptions.

Most security teams did between one and three pentests in 2022, but a much more sizable
portion in the UK and Germany did more than six pentests.

In the UK and Germany, fewer complained of these challenges, but where they did struggle is
preparing their environment accurately for the test.

In the US, compliance was the most common goal (48% selected, see next page), followed
by fulfilling customer requests, and testing new features in their application.

The top objectives in the UK and Germany were checking for specific vulnerabilities (66%
selected), fulfilling a compliance requirement, and testing for cloud misconfigurations.

With time and resources in short supply, every pentest should deliver results quickly with
no disruption to infrastructure. That, however, is not the case. More than half (62%) of
US respondents said engagements with different vendors had disrupted their business
operations, and 66% shared they had had to do unexpected clean-up after the test (not
counting fixing vulnerabilities the tests had discovered).

Teams are under pressure to achieve more with less, and an unproductive, disruptive pentest
does not help them get closer to their goals. Your pentesting vendor should take charge and
ensure tests run smoothly, but that’s not to say things are entirely out of your control. In the
next part of the report, we share practical steps on how to prepare for each test and extract
maximum value, guided by insights from the Cobalt Core — our community of 400+ skilled
and vetted pentesting professionals.

## PART 3
# Set Up Your Pentests for Success

Recommendations from Cobalt’s pentesters on how to prepare and maximize ROI.

### Set up the pentest for success with a
clear objective and accurate scope.

Out of the 3,100 pentests we did in 2022, the top areas that slowed the process down were:

*   Testers lacking credentials or necessary access before the test starts
*   Scope misalignment
*   No active collaboration throughout the test
*   Missing brief/asset information

We’ll go over how your team can tackle each of these items, but let’s start at the beginning: setting an objective
and scoping the test correctly. Most of the time, unclear details in this stage are what leads to misalignments
and business disruptions later on.

Start with a clear, achievable objective. Before you kick off your next pentest, align internally on what you want
it to achieve, what needs to get tested, and are there areas testers should prioritize. It’s important to do as
much of this as you can before you kick things off with your vendor, because pentests are typically a time-bound
exercise; once the clock starts ticking, clearing up details will cost you valuable time and resources.

A clear objective leads to an accurate scope, and an accurate scope means more targeted pentests. One of
the first things that should happen when you approach your pentest vendor is to confirm your desired scope.
To give pentesters the chance to test in depth, you should provide more than your application’s URL or how
many static/dynamic pages it has. Consider including more insight into the complexity of your asset, answering
questions like:

*   How many functionalities does your app support?
*   What third-party services does your app call?
*   How many user roles are there, or how many should the testers focus on?
*   Are there any unique setup requirements pentesters should fulfill to follow your internal processes?
    (e.g. setting up MFA, dummy credentials, signing NDAs, etc.)

Having this information will help your vendor correctly estimate how many testers need to join the project,
what skills are required, and how long the engagement should take. If not shared in the preparation stage, this
information will still come up — only later, once the pentest has already started and hours go into recalibrating
the project instead of analyzing your assets.

“If your internal stakeholders’ expectations contradict each
other, you may end up starting a white- or gray-box test,
only to have to change it to a black-box exercise halfway
through. The testers will no longer be in the right mindset
and that will hurt results. Take 2-3 days to get everything
aligned internally, and you’ll have a much more productive
pentest.”
— Tracy Harper, Lead Technical Project Manager at Cobalt

**To-do list before the
test starts:**
1.  Align all internal stakeholders on what the goal of your pentest is and what assets should be in scope — then communicate this information to your vendor.
2.  Describe the in-scope assets with information on endpoints, URLs, number of static and dynamic pages, etc.
3.  Include information on the complexity of your asset, covering the questions we suggest on this page for a more accurate scope — if you want a black-box test, these details don’t have to reach the pentesters joining your project, but your vendor should still be aware in order to staff appropriately.

### Familiarize the pentesters with how
things are supposed to work.

Sometimes your goal will be to simulate an external attack through a black-box pentest, and there’s definitely
value in that exercise. However, it’s important to note that no black-box pentest will perfectly simulate an
external attacker. Pentests are time-bound, whereas externals can have unlimited time for reconnaissance.
What’s more, insider threats can be just as destructive. To capture more scenarios, we recommend a gray- or
white-box pentest, where testers have access to documentation outlining setup, business logic, and internal
knowledge.

Documentation gets the testers quickly up to speed and can range from diagrams to walkthrough videos to
data flow charts — it all depends on how your asset is set up. For example, say you’re pentesting for PCI DSS
compliance: when testers know how you meant to segment your cardholder data environment from the rest of
your systems, they can confirm whether that is in fact working correctly and can withstand attacks.

Documentation doesn’t just make testers’ lives easier — it also makes your findings more accurate,
particularly their severity levels. When testers know the context around your assets and operations, they’re
able to determine a finding’s likelihood and impact much more accurately, in a way that’s customized to your
circumstances. They can also get creative with your functionalities: instead of following the steps A, B, and C
listed in your documentation, they can report if it’s possible to jump from A to C, and whether that move can
cause issues that expose sensitive information. Ultimately, giving your testers context enables them to deliver
the value that makes pentests unique from scanners and other automated tools — you receive results that are
specific to your situation and aligned to your business context.

And, you guessed it, you should provide documentation as part of your test prep, not throughout the testing
process — otherwise you’ll spend 2-3 days meant for testing on gathering paperwork.

“As pentesters, we see a lot of applications, and we
have only a little bit of insight before we start on our
next project. It really helps us focus when we know
the main areas of the application, what exactly are the
functionalities, and are users actually able to follow your
logic flow without breaking things. This way we can
confirm not only where someone external can attack, but
also where an internal user might unknowingly create a
vulnerability or flaw in your systems.”
— Goonjeta Malhotra, Security Researcher & Lead Cobalt Pentester

**To-do list before the
test starts:**
1.  Decide if you want to have a black-, gray-, or white-box pentest.
2.  Share documentation on how your asset(s) are built, how they are meant to function, where data flows, etc.
3.  Example documentation includes: walkthrough videos/demos, process diagrams, data flow charts, user role breakdowns, access control matrix.

### Prepare a staging environment and
your colleagues for the test.

Business disruptions happen most often when tests are taking place in a production environment. While a test
on production will give the most accurate picture of your vulnerabilities, we recommend creating an exact mirror
image on a staging environment and directing your pentesters there.

“Mirror image” is the important keyword here. If you have even a slightly outdated version of your application
on staging, this can hurt your pentests’ results. When you request testers to replicate a discovered issue on
production, you take time away from hunting for other issues. Not only that, but mixing environments makes
your pentest report much more complex, which might complicate audits or conversations with customers
reviewing your security.

In addition to preparing your environment, you should also prepare the credentials that will grant pentesters
the access they need to continue with their work once they’re finished reviewing your app from an
“unauthenticated” point of view — this is a stage most pentests will start with by default. Having credentials
sorted out in advance saves you time during the pentest. This is especially true if the setup isn’t something you
directly manage: going back and forth with your engineers can take 2-3 days from your pentest, wasting time
and resources.

We understand that credential sharing can make teams nervous, both because they involve a high degree of
trust, and because the process can get complicated. We recommend your team creates bogus credentials you
can quickly spin up and disable after the test’s end. In addition, pentest vendors should mandate their testers to
work via a VPN, so you can whitelist their IP addresses prior to the test’s start and monitor their requests. If a
separate team is responsible for security monitoring, make sure they’re aware a test will be taking place so they
don’t unknowingly block the testers from moving forward.

“In contrast to bug bounty, pentesting – in particular,
PtaaS – encourages collaboration and professionalism,
both with other testers as well as clients. I pentest to
hone my skills, but also want to get high satisfaction
ratings so I can pentest more, and earn more. So
delivering on the concept of ‘value’ is extremely
important. It’s something I wish more businesses were
aware of so they could set engagements up for success
at the outset. Our relationship is mutually beneficial.”
— Gisela Hinojosa, Senior Security Consultant at Cobalt

**To-do list before the
test starts:**
1.  Set up a mirror image of your production
    environment and back up critical data.
2.  Set up and share credentials with the testers.
3.  Whitelist pentesters’ IP addresses.
4.  Inform colleagues a pentest will take place and
    which IP addresses will be making requests.

### Collaborate with the pentesters for
a more productive test and better
insights into your vulnerabilities.

“Testers love customers who are proactive and quick to
reply. Their enthusiasm motivates us to cover even more
in our limited time frame. The more active the customer,
the better the pentest results.”
— Harsh Bothra, Lead Cobalt Pentester

You’ve gone through all the prep steps, provided documentation, set up your environment, and informed internal
teams. The test has begun, and you can step back, right? Not quite.

Pentests are becoming more and more of a collaborative process, where the testers communicate directly with
customers and share updates as soon as they find issues, especially high-severity ones. At least, this is how it
works with Pentest as a Service.

Testers are highly-skilled security experts whose time you’re paying for — take advantage of that. To squeeze
every bit of value from your pentest, instead of completely stepping away, we recommend actively engaging
with the testers, asking them questions around their findings and methodology, and just as importantly,
answering their questions too. When testers discover unexpected behaviors, they reach out to confirm if this
is an undocumented functionality, or in fact a flaw. If left unanswered, pentesters will continue with their next
steps, but the results will likely lack important context. This creates extra work for you at the end of the test —
whether to document why you’re accepting the risk from a vulnerability your team doesn’t consider an issue, or
dispute findings altogether. It hurts results and your bandwidth.

Sometimes you might not have the answers and will need time to gather info from other internal teams. We
recommend removing the silos between the pentesters and your colleagues, and not just those responsible for
security — consider inviting members from the development team, who can answer technical questions and
simultaneously learn more about their app’s security. Add them to the Slack channel, comment thread, or email
chain, whichever you’re using with your vendor. This way, people have direct access to each other and can move
things forward quickly — otherwise, you risk losing days of testing to internal alignment.

**To-do list before the
test starts:**
1.  Establish a point of contact (POC) from your team
    who can liaison with the testers.
2.  That POC should be responsive to the results of a
    pentest, analyze results, and ask questions if more
    info is needed.
3.  The POC should also be available to
