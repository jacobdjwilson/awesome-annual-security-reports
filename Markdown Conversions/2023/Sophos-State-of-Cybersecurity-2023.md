The State of Cybersecurity 2023: The Business Impact of AdversariesExecutive Summary
Situation: Adversaries Are Accelerating, and Defenders 
Are Unable to Keep UpThe study revealed that todays reality is a two\-speed cybersecurity system with 
adversaries and defenders moving at different speeds. Through automation, 
cybercrime as\-a\-service models, stealthy impersonation, and adaptation, 
adversaries are accelerating and can now execute a wide range of sophisticated 
attacks at scale. With 94% of organizations experiencing a cyberattack of some 
form in the last year, all companies regardless of size or revenue should 
assume they will be a target in 2023\.Slowed by a shortage of expertise, an overwhelming volume of alerts, and 
too much time spent on incident response, defenders are unable to keep up. 
Operationalizing threat detection and response is difficult for most organizations, 
with 93% finding the execution of essential security operations tasks challenging.Investigating security alerts is a widespread issue. On average, just under half 
(48%) of all alerts are investigated to determine whether they are signs of 
malicious activity, and most organizations struggle to identify (71%) and prioritize 
(71%) which alertsevents to investigate. For the alerts that require it, the full 
detection, investigation and response process takes nine hours on average for 
organizations with 100\-3,000 employees, rising to 15 hours for those with 3,001\-
5,000 employees.Operationally, defenders lack confidence in their processes, with security tool 
misconfiguration identified as the top perceived security risk in 2023\. Over half 
(52%) of IT professionals say that cyberthreats are now too advanced for their 
organization to deal with on their own, rising to 64% among small businesses 
(100\-250 employees).Business Impact: The Situation Has Financial, Operational
and Resourcing ConsequencesThis two\-speed system has a considerable impact on the wider organization. 
The direct financial repercussions of a cyber incident are huge and already well\-
known, with the average cost to a small or mid\-sized organization to remediate a 
ransomware attack coming in at $1\.4 million1\. These incident clean\-up costs are, 
however, just part of the story.Capacity for IT program delivery is reduced, with 55% of respondents reporting 
that dealing with cyberthreats has negatively impacted the IT teams work on 
other projects. The urgent and unpredictable nature of cybersecurity also gets 
in the way of business\-focused efforts: 64% wish the IT team could spend more 
time on strategic issues and less time on firefighting.The lengthy time spent on detecting, investigating and remediating security 
alerts also has a considerable financial impact in terms of the resourcing cost.The situation also creates a heavy burden on employees. 57% of IT professionals 
say that worrying about the organization being hit by a cyberattack sometimes 
keeps them up at night, rising to 65% among those working in organizations with 
3,001\-5,000 employees. Given the high costs of recruiting, training, and retaining 
staff in this space, these repercussions create additional challenges and costs 
for the business.1The State of Ransomware 2022, SophosA Sophos Whitepaper. April 2023The State of Cybersecurity 2023: The Business Impact of AdversariesRecommendation: Accelerate the Defender Flywheel to 
Move Ahead of AdversariesKey findingsEnabling defenders to overtake attackers in the 2023 cybersecurity race requires 
a comprehensive, but straightforward approach. Firstly, organizations need to set 
up an incident response process that can scale, achieved through minimizing 
the attack surface and the volume of alerts that require attention, and optimizing 
response time by leveraging specialist services.Next, they need to implement adaptive defenses that automatically adjust to the 
situation. This allows them to slow down adversaries and buy defenders time to 
respond.Finally, they also need to set up a virtuous cycle that combines technology and 
human expertise to turbo\-charge defenses, enabling an increase in speed, 
efficacy, and impact. Together they accelerate the defender flywheel, enabling 
them to pull ahead.Central to the success of this approach is the use of third\-party specialists. 
The good news is that organizations already have a blended approach to 
cybersecurity delivery, with 94% of companies working with external specialists 
in some capacity to scale their operations. As adversaries ramp up their efforts, 
engaging with dedicated security operations expertise is increasingly essential.94% of organizations experienced a cyberattack

Reality from the Front Lines
Top Cyberthreat Concerns for 202399% of IT professionals are concerned about cyberthreats affecting their 
organization in 2023\.Data exfiltration (theft by an external attacker) tops 
the list of threats that IT professionals are most concerned about affecting 
their organization, closely followed by phishing (including spear phishing). 
Ransomware rounds out the top three placements.Its important to remember that these three threats are often interlinked: 
a phishing email often starts an attack that results in data exfiltration and 
ransomware.CYBERTHREATPERCENTAGE OF

happening on the front lines with 94% of organizations experienced at least 
one cyberattack in the last year. While ransomware was the most reported 
attack, adversaries execute a wide range of attacks at scale. This breadth and 
depth of attacks creates a considerable and growing challenge for defenders.Behind these numbers is the increasing professionalization of the 
cybercriminal economy, including the growth of the as a service model, 
including access\-as\-a\-service, phishing\-as\-a\-service, and scamming\-as\-

procedures (TTPs) on the fly using real\-time hands\-on\-keyboard actions in 
response to actions by security technologies and defenders, and as a tactic to 
evade detection. These attacks, which often result in devastating ransomware and 
data breach incidents, are among the hardest to stop.23% of respondents reported that their organization experienced an attack 
involving an active adversary last year. The attack rate was consistent regardless of 
organization size, varying by only two percentage points across all organization size 
segment splits.Interestingly, for organizations with less than $10 million in annual revenue, the 
rate of reported active adversary attacks dropped to just 11%, which may indicate 
that attackers are deliberately focusing on targets with deeper pockets. Detecting 
active adversaries requires a high level of skill and it is likely that the actual rate of 
incidents is higher.Reflecting the potential devastation of these attacks, 30% of respondents reported

The State of Cybersecurity 2023: The Business Impact of AdversariesDiffering Approaches to Alert InvestigationDetection, Investigation and Response OverheadOrganizations investigate 48% of their security 
alerts to identify if they are signs of malicious activityOne of the challenges for defenders is identifying which alerts to investigate and 
how to use their limited resources to best effect.On average, just under half (48%) of all security alerts are investigated to identify 
whether they are signs of malicious activity, rising to 54% in organizations with 
3,001\-5,000 employees. However, approaches differ greatly: 16% of organizations 
investigate more than three quarters of their alerts (including 5% who report they 
investigate all alerts) while 18% investigate a quarter or fewer.From a sector perspective, centralfederal government investigates the lowest 
percentage of alerts (39%) (n\=89\) while energy, oilgas and utilities investigates 
the highest (55%) (n\=69\).The median time to detect, investigate, and respond to an alert is nine hours for 
organizations with 100\-3,000 employees, rising to 15 hours for organizations 
with 3,001\-5,000 employees, likely reflecting the increased complexity of their 
operating environments.The survey revealed considerable variation by industry, with organizations in the 
manufacturing and production (15 hours) and energy, oilgas and utilities (18 
hours) sectors taking more than twice as long as those in IT, technology and 
telecoms (6\.75 hours).Its important to note that the majority of alerts will not reach the response stage. 
Most attacks will be blocked proactively by security technologies with a subset of 
alerts triaged and brought forward for investigation. Response actions will also vary 
considerably due to the nature of the event that requires remediation, from deleting 
a phishing email from users' inboxes to rebuilding an entire server farm.Median time to detect, investigate, and respond to an alertACTIVITYDetectionInvestigationResponseTotal100\-3,000 EMPLOYEES

The State of Cybersecurity 2023: The Business Impact of AdversariesOrganizations Lack Essential Security Operations SkillsAs already seen, IT professionals consider the shortage of in\-house cybersecurity 
skillsexpertise to be one of their biggest security risks for 2023\. Diving deeper, 
the survey reveals that the majority of organizations struggle with the day\-to\-
day delivery of core security operations tasks, with 93% rating at least one of the 
following activities as 'challenging': Identifying signals from noise (71% find challenging) Prioritizing which signalsalerts to investigate (71% find challenging) Getting sufficient data to identify if a signal is 
malicious or benign (71% find challenging) Remediating malicious alerts or incidents in a timely way (71% find challenging) Identifying the root cause of the incident (75% find challenging) Keeping accurate records of investigations (68% find challenging)Identifying the root cause of the incident is the most widespread issue, with 75% of 
respondents reporting that they find it challenging.Organizations with the lowest annual revenue (below $10 million) are most likely 
to find security operations tasks challenging, followed by those with the largest 
revenue ($5 billion \+). Both ends of the spectrum will face different obstacles, 
with organizational and system complexity likely to play a greater role in larger 
organizations.This skills shortage creates a domino effect: investigating alerts takes longer, which, 
in turn, reduces the capacity of the team and increases risk exposure.93%

an organization. The highest individual bills occur in the event of a major cyber 
incident. As reported in the Sophos State of Ransomware 2022 report, the 
average ransomware remediation bill comes in at $1\.4 million.57% of respondents say that worrying about the organization being hit by a cyberattack 
sometimes keeps them up at night. Given the high costs of recruiting and retaining 
staff in this space, this is a cause of both welfare and economic concern. It also 
suggests that defenders do not have full confidence in their security tools.However, the financial impact of dealing with cyberattacks is not limited to the 
clean\-up costs. With the average IT Security Specialist salary in the U.S. currently 
just shy of $100,000 per year2, the hourly resource cost for each security alert 
investigation is considerable. While salaries will vary based on local conditions, 
the financial impact of the lengthy incident investigation process is considerable.Burn out is a major issue in cybersecurity. Too many alerts and having too much to do 
puts considerable stress on employees. Over\-stretched teams are more likely to miss 
important signals, adding further pressure. Ultimately, people will eventually break.The propensity for cybersecurity worries to stop people from sleeping increases 
steadily as organization revenue grows, starting at 43% of those in organizations with 
less than $10 million annual revenue and rising to 67% in organizations that turn over

implement a more scalable incident response process that accelerates response 
time; leverage adaptive defenses to slow down adversaries; and create a virtuous 
cycle that improves protection and lowers cost.A Shields Up analogy is useful here. Stopping advanced, persistent adversaries 
requires organizations optimize the efficacy of their defenses (shields), 
including context\-sensitive technologies that can elevate the level of protection 
in proportion to the situation. Crucially, they also need to use the time that their 
defenses buy them to apply human expertise to address the root cause. requiresThe quality of your cybersecurity technologies is paramount, and security controls 
should: Optimize prevention, automatically detecting and stopping as many threats 
as possible early in the attack chain. In doing so, you reduce the risk to the 
organization while freeing up defenders to focus on fewer incidents. Reduce exposure by making it easy to ensure security investments are 
correctly and optimally deployed and avoid misconfiguration issues. Disrupt adversaries. Technologies that automatically detect and disrupt 
adversarial activity frustrate attackers while buying defenders time to 
neutralize the incident.Optimize

dont guarantee 100% prevention, however, which is why timely, well\-informed, and 
well\-executed root cause remediation is essential.As the research has shown, adversaries do not follow a single path. Leveraging 
telemetry from across the security environment, using the security controls 
organizations already have, enables defenders to see and respond to threats faster 
while increasing return on existing investments.Finding malicious activity among the benign alerts is often akin to hunting for the 
needle in the haystack, or even in a pile of needles. Processing the signals through 
an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platform that adds contextual insights 
and correlates related alerts enables in\-house defenders to quickly focus on whats 
important. Investigation and response can be performed via an XDR platform 
by the in\-house team. Alternatively, organizations can outsource the detection, 
investigation, and response work to a specialist Managed Detection and Response 
(MDR) service.Security ControlsEndpoint

more force behind a flywheel, the faster it goes. Organizations can accelerate 
their cybersecurity flywheel by combining security technologies and human 
expertise. Comprehensive security controls reduce the volume of alerts that 
defenders need to deal with, enabling them to focus on neutralizing attacks 
and elevating their security posture. In turn, this increases the efficacy of their 
security controls, creating a virtuous circle.Most Organizations Plan to Adopt
the Security Controls and Services NeededThe survey revealed that most organizations plan to add threat detection and 
response solutions to their security stack within the next 12 months. Over three 
quarters (78%) plan to add Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) andor 
Extended Detection and Response (XDR) tools in the coming year.Investigating and responding to advanced cyberthreats is a specialist skill and 
providing 247 coverage requires a minimum of five or six people. With a shortage 
of in\-house cybersecurity skillsexpertise listed as one of the top three perceived 
cyber risks for 2023, many organizations are looking to external experts for 
support: 44% of organizations plan to start working with a Managed Detection
