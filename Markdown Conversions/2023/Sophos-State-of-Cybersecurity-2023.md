## Executive Summary

### Situation: Adversaries Are Accelerating, and Defenders
Are Unable to Keep Up

The study revealed that today’s reality is a two-speed cybersecurity system with
adversaries and defenders moving at different speeds. Through automation,
cybercrime “as-a-service” models, stealthy impersonation, and adaptation,
adversaries are accelerating and can now execute a wide range of sophisticated
attacks at scale. With 94% of organizations experiencing a cyberattack of some
form in the last year, all companies – regardless of size or revenue – should
assume they will be a target in 2023.

Slowed by a shortage of expertise, an overwhelming volume of alerts, and
too much time spent on incident response, defenders are unable to keep up.
Operationalizing threat detection and response is difficult for most organizations,
with 93% finding the execution of essential security operations tasks challenging.

Investigating security alerts is a widespread issue. On average, just under half
(48%) of all alerts are investigated to determine whether they are signs of
malicious activity, and most organizations struggle to identify (71%) and prioritize
(71%) which alerts/events to investigate. For the alerts that require it, the full
detection, investigation and response process takes nine hours on average for
organizations with 100-3,000 employees, rising to 15 hours for those with 3,001-
5,000 employees.

Operationally, defenders lack confidence in their processes, with security tool
misconfiguration identified as the top perceived security risk in 2023. Over half
(52%) of IT professionals say that cyberthreats are now too advanced for their
organization to deal with on their own, rising to 64% among small businesses
(100-250 employees).

### Business Impact: The Situation Has Financial, Operational
and Resourcing Consequences

This two-speed system has a considerable impact on the wider organization.
The direct financial repercussions of a cyber incident are huge and already well-
known, with the average cost to a small or mid-sized organization to remediate
a ransomware attack coming in at $1.4 million¹. These incident clean-up costs are,
however, just part of the story.

Capacity for IT program delivery is reduced, with 55% of respondents reporting
that dealing with cyberthreats has negatively impacted the IT team’s work on
other projects. The urgent and unpredictable nature of cybersecurity also gets
in the way of business-focused efforts: 64% wish the IT team could spend more
time on strategic issues and less time on firefighting.

The lengthy time spent on detecting, investigating and remediating security
alerts also has a considerable financial impact in terms of the resourcing cost.

The situation also creates a heavy burden on employees. 57% of IT professionals
say that worrying about the organization being hit by a cyberattack sometimes
keeps them up at night, rising to 65% among those working in organizations with
3,001-5,000 employees. Given the high costs of recruiting, training, and retaining
staff in this space, these repercussions create additional challenges and costs
for the business.

### Recommendation: Accelerate the Defender Flywheel to
Move Ahead of Adversaries

#### Key findings

Enabling defenders to overtake attackers in the 2023 cybersecurity race requires
a comprehensive, but straightforward approach. Firstly, organizations need to set
up an incident response process that can scale, achieved through minimizing
the attack surface and the volume of alerts that require attention, and optimizing
response time by leveraging specialist services.

Next, they need to implement adaptive defenses that automatically adjust to the
situation. This allows them to slow down adversaries and buy defenders time to
respond.

Finally, they also need to set up a virtuous cycle that combines technology and
human expertise to turbo-charge defenses, enabling an increase in speed,
efficacy, and impact. Together they accelerate the defender flywheel, enabling
them to pull ahead.

Central to the success of this approach is the use of third-party specialists.
The good news is that organizations already have a blended approach to
cybersecurity delivery, with 94% of companies working with external specialists
in some capacity to scale their operations. As adversaries ramp up their efforts,
engaging with dedicated security operations expertise is increasingly essential.

## Cyberthreats 2023:
Reality from the Front Lines

### Top Cyberthreat Concerns for 2023

99% of IT professionals are concerned about cyberthreats affecting their
organization in 2023. Data exfiltration (theft by an external attacker) tops
the list of threats that IT professionals are most concerned about affecting
their organization, closely followed by phishing (including spear phishing).
Ransomware rounds out the top three placements.

It’s important to remember that these three threats are often interlinked:
a phishing email often starts an attack that results in data exfiltration and
ransomware.

| CYBERTHREAT                                          | PERCENTAGE OF RESPONDENTS SAYING IT IS A TOP CONCERN |

## Adversaries Now Execute Myriad Attacks at Scale

The concerns of IT professional closely match the reality of what is
happening on the front lines with 94% of organizations experienced at least
one cyberattack in the last year. While ransomware was the most reported
attack, adversaries execute a wide range of attacks at scale. This breadth and
depth of attacks creates a considerable and growing challenge for defenders.

Behind these numbers is the increasing professionalization of the
cybercriminal economy, including the growth of the ‘as a service’ model,
including ‘access-as-a-service’, ‘phishing-as-a-service’, and ‘scamming-as-
a-service.’ This evolution in cybercrime operations has lowered the barriers
to entry for would-be cybercriminals. [For more information, read the Sophos
2023 Threat Report.]

## Active Adversary Attacks Are Now Commonplace

### Active Adversary Attack Experience by Revenue

*   23%
    of organizations experienced
    an attack involving an Active
    Adversary in the last year
*   30%
    say Active Adversaries are
    one of their top cyberthreat

    concerns for 2023

Active adversaries are threat actors who adapt their techniques, tactics, and
procedures (TTPs) on the fly using real-time hands-on-keyboard actions in
response to actions by security technologies and defenders, and as a tactic to
evade detection. These attacks, which often result in devastating ransomware and
data breach incidents, are among the hardest to stop.

23% of respondents reported that their organization experienced an attack
involving an active adversary last year. The attack rate was consistent regardless of
organization size, varying by only two percentage points across all organization size
segment splits.

Interestingly, for organizations with less than $10 million in annual revenue, the
rate of reported active adversary attacks dropped to just 11%, which may indicate
that attackers are deliberately focusing on targets with deeper pockets. Detecting
active adversaries requires a high level of skill and it is likely that the actual rate of
incidents is higher.

Reflecting the potential devastation of these attacks, 30% of respondents reported
that active adversaries are one of their top cyberthreat concerns for 2023.

## Understanding Active Adversaries

To appreciate the challenge facing defenders, it’s essential to understand that
blocking active adversaries is not enough to thwart them. These skilled and
persistent threat actors deploy multiple techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs)
to achieve their goals, including:

*   Exploiting security weaknesses to penetrate organizations and
    move laterally once inside the network, including stolen credentials,
    unpatched vulnerabilities, and security tool misconfigurations,
*   Abusing legitimate IT tools used by defenders to avoid triggering detections,
*   Modifying their attacks in real-time in response to security controls, by
    continuing to pivot to new techniques until they find a way to achieve their goals.

## Cybersecurity 2023:
The State of the Defenders

### Top Cyber Risk Concerns

Security control misconfigurations (e.g., of an endpoint or firewall solution) are the
most widely reported perceived security risk, with 27.4% of respondents including
it in their top three cyber vulnerabilities. This top ranking illustrates the challenges
IT teams face in ensuring that their security controls remain correctly configured
and deployed at all times, and the readiness with which adversaries exploit any
gap in an organization’s defenses.

Zero-day attacks, i.e., attacks that take advantage of a previously unknown
security vulnerability or software flaw, are in second position, rated a top three
security risk at 26.8%. A shortage of in-house cybersecurity skills/expertise is
third on the list, rated a top three security risk by 25% of respondents.

There is a direct relationship between skills shortage and security tool
misconfiguration: without the time, knowledge, and experience to configure
controls correctly, you create gaps in your defenses.

## Differing Approaches to Alert Investigation

### Detection, Investigation and Response Overhead

Organizations investigate 48% of their security
alerts to identify if they are signs of malicious activity

One of the challenges for defenders is identifying which alerts to investigate and
how to use their limited resources to best effect.

On average, just under half (48%) of all security alerts are investigated to identify
whether they are signs of malicious activity, rising to 54% in organizations with
3,001-5,000 employees. However, approaches differ greatly: 16% of organizations
investigate more than three quarters of their alerts (including 5% who report they
investigate all alerts) while 18% investigate a quarter or fewer.

From a sector perspective, central/federal government investigates the lowest
percentage of alerts (39%) (n=89) while energy, oil/gas and utilities investigates
the highest (55%) (n=69).

The median time to detect, investigate, and respond to an alert is nine hours for
organizations with 100-3,000 employees, rising to 15 hours for organizations
with 3,001-5,000 employees, likely reflecting the increased complexity of their
operating environments.

The survey revealed considerable variation by industry, with organizations in the
manufacturing and production (15 hours) and energy, oil/gas and utilities (18
hours) sectors taking more than twice as long as those in IT, technology and
telecoms (6.75 hours).

It’s important to note that the majority of alerts will not reach the response stage.
Most attacks will be blocked proactively by security technologies with a subset of
alerts triaged and brought forward for investigation. Response actions will also vary
considerably due to the nature of the event that requires remediation, from deleting
a phishing email from users' inboxes to rebuilding an entire server farm.

## Organizations Lack Essential Security Operations Skills

As already seen, IT professionals consider the shortage of in-house cybersecurity
skills/expertise to be one of their biggest security risks for 2023. Diving deeper,
the survey reveals that the majority of organizations struggle with the day-to-
day delivery of core security operations tasks, with 93% rating at least one of the
following activities as 'challenging':

*   Identifying signals from noise (71% find challenging)
*   Prioritizing which signals/alerts to investigate (71% find challenging)
*   Getting sufficient data to identify if a signal is
    malicious or benign (71% find challenging)
*   Remediating malicious alerts or incidents in a timely way (71% find challenging)
*   Identifying the root cause of the incident (75% find challenging)
*   Keeping accurate records of investigations (68% find challenging)

Identifying the root cause of the incident is the most widespread issue, with 75% of
respondents reporting that they find it challenging.

Organizations with the lowest annual revenue (below $10 million) are most likely
to find security operations tasks challenging, followed by those with the largest
revenue ($5 billion +). Both ends of the spectrum will face different obstacles,
with organizational and system complexity likely to play a greater role in larger
organizations.

This skills shortage creates a domino effect: investigating alerts takes longer, which,
in turn, reduces the capacity of the team and increases risk exposure.

*   93%
    find security operations challenging
*   75%
    find it hard to identify the root cause
    of the incident
*   71%
    struggle to identify which alerts
    to investigate

## Adversaries Have Outpaced Defenders

### Cyberthreats are now too advanced for the organization to deal
with on their own

*   52%
    say cyberthreats are now too advanced for their

    organization to deal with on their own

Over half (52%) of IT professionals say that cyberthreats are now too advanced
for their organization to deal with on their own, rising to 64% among small
businesses (100-250 employees).

As organizational revenue increases, so does the likelihood that in-house
teams cannot keep up. This likely reflects the greater complexity of the internal
cybersecurity environment in larger revenue organizations and a greater
propensity to engage specialist security services. It may also reflect a greater
understanding of the threat environment and the challenges in defending
against advanced threats.

## The Business Impact

### Program Delivery Impact

*   64%
    wish the IT team could spend
    more time on strategic issues
    and less time on firefighting
*   55%
    say dealing with cyberthreats
    has negatively impacted the IT
    team’s work on other projects

For 60% of organizations, cybersecurity and the wider IT function are very tightly
linked: 52% have a cybersecurity team within their IT team, while for 8%, their IT
team manages their cybersecurity. The remaining 40% have separate cybersecurity
and IT teams. The vast amount of time and effort required for cybersecurity has
considerable consequences for the IT organization.

Over half (55%) of organizations say that dealing with cyberthreats has negatively
impacted the IT team’s work on other projects, with the highest-revenue
organizations reporting the greatest impact.

The urgent and unpredictable nature of cybersecurity also gets in the way of
business-focused efforts: 64%, on average, wish the IT team could spend more
time on strategic issues and less time on firefighting. Again, as revenue increases, so
does the impact on wider program delivery.

### Financial Impact

The challenging cybersecurity environment has multiple financial impacts for
an organization. The highest individual bills occur in the event of a major cyber
incident. As reported in the Sophos State of Ransomware 2022 report, the
average ransomware remediation bill comes in at $1.4 million.

However, the financial impact of dealing with cyberattacks is not limited to the
clean-up costs. With the average IT Security Specialist salary in the U.S. currently
just shy of $100,000 per year², the hourly resource cost for each security alert
investigation is considerable. While salaries will vary based on local conditions,
the financial impact of the lengthy incident investigation process is considerable.

### Team Impact

57% of respondents say that worrying about the organization being hit by a cyberattack
keeps them up at night. Given the high costs of recruiting and retaining
staff in this space, this is a cause of both welfare and economic concern. It also
suggests that defenders do not have full confidence in their security tools.

Burn out is a major issue in cybersecurity. Too many alerts and having too much to do
puts considerable stress on employees. Over-stretched teams are more likely to miss
important signals, adding further pressure. Ultimately, people will eventually break.

The propensity for cybersecurity worries to stop people from sleeping increases
steadily as organization revenue grows, starting at 43% of those in organizations with
less than $10 million annual revenue and rising to 67% in organizations that turn over
$5 billion or more.

## Recommendations

### Strong Shields Are Essential

Addressing the situation requires a straightforward three-step approach:
implement a more scalable incident response process that accelerates response
time; leverage adaptive defenses to slow down adversaries; and create a virtuous
cycle that improves protection and lowers cost.

A “Shields Up” analogy is useful here. Stopping advanced, persistent adversaries
requires organizations optimize the efficacy of their defenses (“shields”),
including context-sensitive technologies that can elevate the level of protection
in proportion to the situation. Crucially, they also need to use the time that their
defenses buy them to apply human expertise to address the root cause. requires

The quality of your cybersecurity technologies is paramount, and security controls
should:

*   Optimize prevention, automatically detecting and stopping as many threats
    as possible early in the attack chain. In doing so, you reduce the risk to the
    organization while freeing up defenders to focus on fewer incidents.
*   Reduce exposure by making it easy to ensure security investments are
    correctly and optimally deployed and avoid misconfiguration issues.
*   Disrupt adversaries. Technologies that automatically detect and disrupt
    adversarial activity frustrate attackers while buying defenders time to
    neutralize the incident.

A Sophos Whitepaper. April 2023

### Address The Root Cause with People and Technology

Shields buy defenders valuable time to investigate and respond to attacks. They
don’t guarantee 100% prevention, however, which is why timely, well-informed, and
well-executed root cause remediation is essential.

As the research has shown, adversaries do not follow a single path. Leveraging
telemetry from across the security environment, using the security controls
organizations already have, enables defenders to see and respond to threats faster
while increasing return on existing investments.

Finding malicious activity among the benign alerts is often akin to hunting for the
needle in the haystack, or even in a pile of needles. Processing the signals through
an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platform that adds contextual insights
and correlates related alerts enables in-house defenders to quickly focus on what’s
important. Investigation and response can be performed via an XDR platform
by the in-house team. Alternatively, organizations can outsource the detection,
investigation, and response work to a specialist Managed Detection and Response
(MDR) service.

## Accelerating the Defender Flywheel

Once a flywheel starts spinning at high speed, it wants to keep spinning. The
more force behind a flywheel, the faster it goes. Organizations can accelerate
their cybersecurity flywheel by combining security technologies and human
expertise. Comprehensive security controls reduce the volume of alerts that
defenders need to deal with, enabling them to focus on neutralizing attacks
and elevating their security posture. In turn, this increases the efficacy of their
security controls, creating a virtuous circle.

### Most Organizations Plan to Adopt
the Security Controls and Services Needed

The survey revealed that most organizations plan to add threat detection and
response solutions to their security stack within the next 12 months. Over three
quarters (78%) plan to add Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and/or
Extended Detection and Response (XDR) tools in the coming year.

Investigating and responding to advanced cyberthreats is a specialist skill and
providing 24/7 coverage requires a minimum of five or six people. With a shortage
of in-house cybersecurity skills/expertise listed as one of the top three perceived
cyber risks for 2023, many organizations are looking to external experts for
support: 44% of organizations plan to start working with a Managed Detection
and Response (MDR) provider within the next 12 months.
