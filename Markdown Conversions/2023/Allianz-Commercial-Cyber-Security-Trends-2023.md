## Introduction

Investments in cyber security are paying off but an evolving threat landscape will require much greater focus on early detection and response capabilities.

Improvements in cyber security and business continuity are helping to combat encryption-based ransomware attacks, yet the cyber threat landscape is continually evolving. 2023 has seen a worrying resurgence in ransomware and extortion claims, resulting in an uptick in costly incidents, demonstrating that although progress is being made, the threat posed by ransomware shows little sign of abating.

Reports note that the number of ransomware victims surged by as much as 143% globally during the first quarter of 2023 with January and February seeing the highest number of hack and leak cases in three years. Ransomware alone is projected to cost its victims approximately US$265bn annually by 2031.

Hackers are increasingly targeting IT and physical supply chains, launching mass cyber-attacks and finding new ways to extort money from companies, large and small. Most ransomware attacks now involve the theft of personal or sensitive commercial data for the purpose of extortion, adding further cost and complexity, as well as the increased potential for reputational damage and third-party liability. Allianz analysis of a number of large insurance industry cyber losses shows that the proportion of cases in which data is exfiltrated is increasing every year – from 40% of cases in 2019 to around 77% of cases in 2022, with 2023 on course to surpass last year’s total.

Protecting an organization against intrusion remains a cat and mouse game, in which the cyber criminals have the advantage. Threat actors are now exploring ways to use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate and accelerate attacks, creating more effective AI-powered malware and phishing. Combined with the explosion in connected mobile devices and 5G-enabled Internet of Things, the avenues for cyber-attacks look only likely to increase in the coming years.

**Key Statistics:**
- **143%** increase in the number of ransomware victims globally during the first quarter of 2023.
- **January and February** saw the highest number of hack and leak cases in three years.
- **US$265bn** is the approximate projected annual cost of ransomware to its victims by 2031.

Preventing a cyber-attack is therefore becoming harder, and the stakes higher. As a result, early detection and response capabilities are becoming ever more important. An intrusion can quickly escalate, and once data is encrypted and / or stolen, the consequences and costs snowball – costs can be as much as, or even more than, 1,000 times higher than if an incident is not detected and contained early, Allianz analysis shows.

Ultimately, early detection and effective response capabilities will be key to mitigating the impact of cyber-attacks and ensuring a sustainable insurance market going forward.

## Threat landscape: Resurgent ransomware targets data and supply chains

Ransomware remains the top cyber threat and the single largest cause of cyber insurance claims by some distance. Following a short hiatus in 2022, ransomware attack frequency has picked up again in 2023 as threat actors use data exfiltration and supply chain attacks to maximize their leverage.

In many ways, the last 12 months has been business as usual for ransomware gangs. They continue to evolve their tactics and business models in response to changes in cyber security and as they find new ways to extort money from businesses and public sector organizations.

According to research from cyber threat intelligence firm Black Kite[^1], ransomware attacks surged in early 2023, with the number of victims in March nearly double that of last April and 1.6 times higher than the peak month in 2022. Akamai Technologies said the number of ransomware victims surged by 143% globally in the first quarter of 2023[^2]. Meanwhile, January and February 2023 saw the highest number of ransomware hack and leak cases in the past three years, according to the NCC Group, which also noted that ransomware activity was up almost 50% year-on-year as of May 2023[^3]. In future, ransomware alone is projected to cost its victims approximately US$265bn annually by 2031, Cybersecurity Ventures predicts[^4].

A surge in data exfiltration attacks from the likes of LockBit and Clop in 2023 has seen the number of attacks reach new levels, while according to cryptocurrency firm Chainalysis, ransomware victims paid demands of US$449.1mn[^5] in the first six months of this year, already close to last year’s total of US$500mn. At the current rate, 2023 could end up as the second biggest year for ransomware revenue after 2021.

### Key developments
- Ransomware groups continue to adapt their tactics and business models in response to cyber security changes.
- Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) remains a key driver for the ongoing frequency of attacks.
- Double and triple extortion attacks are not new, but they are now more prevalent, and potentially more impactful and costly for affected companies.
- Supply chain-enabled ransomware attacks have now become an established part of the ransomware playbook.
- Rise in mass ransomware attacks means insurers will need to better understand the interconnectivity and dependencies that exist between companies and within digital supply chains.

This year has witnessed several large mass ransomware attacks as threat actors used exploits in software and weaknesses in IT supply chains to target multiple companies. At the same time, ransomware gangs continue to fine tune their business models in order to carry out more attacks, faster. According to research from IBM X-Force[^6], the average number of days taken to execute a ransomware attack has fallen from 60+ days in 2019 to less than four days in 2021.

In June, ransomware group Clop carried out a successful mass cyber-attack that is thought to have impacted thousands of companies, compromising the data of millions of individuals and businesses. Clop exploited a ‘zero-day’ vulnerability in MOVEit file transfer software to steal data from companies and public sector organizations, threatening to publish the data if they failed to pay a ransom demand.

The attack affected a number of large corporates, including energy giant Shell, British Airways, broadcaster the BBC, logistics firm DHL, insurer Genworth Financial, as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Energy[^7]. Genworth Financial alone reported that the personal information of nearly 2.5 million to 2.7 million of its customers was breached[^8]. Clop is now the second-largest ransomware group by number of victims.

> "As companies have enhanced network security and backup strategies, and as regulation dissuades companies from paying ransom demands, the chances of a successful encryption ransomware attack are becoming slimmer, and threat actors are changing strategies," explains Rishi Baviskar, Global Head of Cyber Risk Consulting, Allianz Commercial. "The recent MOVEit supply chain attack is a good example of how gangs are increasingly resorting to mass attacks and data exfiltration."

### RaaS groups responsible for majority of incidents
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) remains a key driver for the ongoing frequency of attacks. With access to RaaS kits and services, criminals lacking the skill to develop their own malware can launch ransomware attacks quickly and affordably. With prices starting from US$40 per month, RaaS kits enable cyber criminals to make millions from extortion demands with little financial investment.

**RaaS Statistics:**
- RaaS kits start at **US$40 per month**.
- LockBit: **1,700+** attacks since 2020 in the US.
- **US$91mn** approximate cost of ransoms paid to LockBit.

> "This is not a problem that is going away," says Michael Daum, Global Head of Cyber Claims at Allianz Commercial. "We often deal with the same attack groups. They change – they disappear, reorganize and then reappear under a different name – but the groups with the best tactics make the most money, and then they start re-selling their tools and expertise to others. They operate like successful businesses."

### Data exfiltration becomes the norm
Double and triple extortion – using a combination of encryption, data exfiltration and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to extort money – are not new, but they are now more prevalent, and potentially more impactful and costly for affected companies.

Allianz analysis of a number of larger insurance industry cyber losses (>€1mn) between 2019 and the end of the first half of 2023 shows that the proportion of cases in which data is exfiltrated increases from year to year:
- **2019**: 40%
- **2022**: 77%
- **2023**: Over 77%

**Ransom Payment Trends:**
- Proportion of companies paying a ransom: **10% in 2019** vs **54% in 2022**.
- Companies are **2.5x more likely** to pay a ransom in cases where data has been exfiltrated, on top of the encryption.

It compares Single Extortion (encryption) costs like Lost Income, Recovery Expenses, Extortion Payment, and Forensics Expenses against Double Extortion (encryption and exfiltration) which adds Notifications Costs, Monitoring Costs, Regulatory Fines/Legal Expenses, and Data Recovery/PR Repairment.]

> "Attackers will 100% try to exfiltrate data before they try to encrypt. It’s faster and easier compared to fully encrypting the victim’s environment. In almost every extortion-focused intrusion, data will get exfiltrated," says Michael Daum.

### Top industries targeted
The percentage of extortion cases by industry observed in incident response engagements in 2022:
- **Manufacturing**: 30%
- **Professional, business, and consumer services**: 22%
- **Energy**: 13%
- **Finance and insurance**: 13%
- **Retail and wholesale**: 9%
- **Media and telecom**: 4%
- **Education**: 4%
- **Transportation**: 4%

### Threat actors target weak links in supply chains
Supply chain-enabled ransomware attacks have now become an established part of the ransomware playbook. Increasingly, threat actors are targeting companies in the IT supply chain, as well as companies that hold sensitive data in physical supply chains.

Notable examples include:
- **SolarWinds (2019)**: One of the largest software supply chain attacks.
- **Kaseya (2021)**: Exploited a zero-day vulnerability impacting 1,500 businesses with a US$70mn ransom demand[^11].
- **JumpCloud (2023)**: North Korean hacking group penetrated the provider to target cryptocurrency companies[^12].

### Mass attacks raise accumulation concerns
Mass ransomware attacks are a potential “gamechanger” for the insurance industry.
> "This year we had our first event case, with 40 policies triggered at the same time. The once theoretical risk of an accumulation exposure is now reality," says Jens Krickhahn, Regional Practice Leader, Cyber Insurance, Allianz Commercial.

## Future threats: AI, IoT and skills shortage to fuel future cyber-attacks

Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely expected to power future ransomware attacks, with automated attack processes, more convincing phishing, and faster malware development.

### Key developments
- AI-powered language models and voice simulation software are recent additions to the cyber criminal’s arsenal.
- Allianz Commercial has seen a growing number of incidents caused by poor cyber security around mobile devices.
- Technical skills crisis in cyber security is also increasing the cost of responding to an incident.

Threat actors are already using AI-powered language models like ChatGPT to write code. Generative AI can help less technically proficient threat actors write their own code or create new strains and variations of existing ransomware.

**Deepfake and Voice Simulation:**
- In 2019, a CEO was scammed out of **€220,000** via AI-generated voice simulation[^15].
- Deepfake video technology for phishing is being sold for as little as **US$20 per minute**.

### Mobile devices expose personal and corporate data
Lax security and the mixing of personal and corporate data on mobile devices is making for an attractive target.
> "Cyber criminals are now targeting mobile devices with specific malware in order to gain remote access, steal login credentials, or to deploy ransomware," says Rishi Baviskar.

### Cyber security skills shortage
The current global cyber security workforce gap stands at **3.4 million people**[^16].
- **70%** of organizations say they do not have enough cyber security staff to be effective.
- Organizations with high security skills shortages had a **US$5.36mn** average data breach cost, 20% higher than average[^18].

## Claims: Stabilization trend threatened by mass attacks and data exfiltration

Cyber claims frequency picked up again during the first half of 2023, although improved cyber security over the past two years has helped control first party losses.

### Key developments
- Ransomware and extortion-based attacks remain the largest source of cyber insurance claims.
- Uptick in data privacy claims in the US related to biometric information.
- Analysis shows breaches not detected early can be 1,000 times more expensive.

![Image description: Bar chart showing "Number of cyber-related claims per year" from 2017 to 1H 2023. 2017: 250; 2018: 518; 2019: 863; 2020: 1,131; 2021: 1,086; 2022: 956; 1H 2023: 785.]

### Cause of loss by value of cyber claims
- **External manipulation of systems**: 81%
- **Accidental internal cause**: 9%
- **Malicious internal action**: 9%

### Privacy and liability risks on watch
There has been an uptick in US data privacy claims related to biometric information (voice, fingerprint) under laws like the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).
> "Defending these actions is much more expensive than a typical general liability claim," says Marisa Anthony, Senior Complex Claims Handler.

### Data exfiltration and inflation drive up claims costs
Business interruption accounts for **50%** of all cyber-related losses by value.
- Average cost of a data breach in 2023: **US$4.45mn**[^19].
- Proportion of cases becoming public: **60% in 2019** vs **85% in 2022**.

## Mitigation: Early detection is key to combating emerging cyber threat

The vast majority of cyber-attacks are contained quickly. According to Allianz analysis, just 2% of claims drive the overall loss amount.

### Key developments
- The key to avoiding damaging cyber-attacks is early detection.
- Companies should direct additional spend on detection and response.
- Proper data management (deletion of old data) reduces risk.
- Smaller companies need tailored security measures and MSSP collaboration.

### €20,000 or €20mn?
**Example Case (Manufacturing company, 2,000 employees):**
- **Outcome 1 (Early Detection):** Attack contained before admin access. Cost: **€20,000**.
- **Outcome 2 (Late Detection):** Attacker gains domain admin rights, encrypts system. Cost: **€20mn** (1,000 times more).

> "Prevention drives frequency, while detection determines severity," says Michael Daum.

### Preparing for the worst
- **Data Management**: Purge old data. One claim involved a 10-year-old hard drive that hadn't been managed.
- **Vendor Services**: Secure specialist vendors (breach coaches, forensics) in advance to avoid "emergency" rates.
- **Tabletop Exercises**: Conduct simulations to ensure the response plan works.

### Reliance on outsourcing puts small and mid-sized firms at risk
- Data breaches at small businesses jumped **152%** during 2021[^21].
- **54%** of SMEs in the UK experienced a cyber-attack in 2022[^22].
