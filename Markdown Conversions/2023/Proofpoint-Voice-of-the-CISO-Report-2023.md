## Introduction

### A Reality Check for CISOs

It’s no overstatement to say that the past year was a busy one in the world of cybersecurity.

Ransomware continued to wreak havoc across the globe. New and increasingly devastating attacks upended organizations of every size, across every industry and in every jurisdiction. For example, a single ransomware attack contributed to the permanent closure of Lincoln College, a 157-year-old educational bastion in rural Illinois.[^1] On the other end of the spectrum, a series of attacks paralyzed the government of Costa Rica, forcing officials there to declare a national emergency.[^2]

The supply chain also found itself firmly in the sights of cyber criminals. Attackers doubled down on compromising third party, cloud and privileged identities to infiltrate networks and exfiltrate data.[^3]

Meanwhile, critical infrastructure hung in the balance amid a backdrop of unrelenting attacks and geopolitical unease. Russian attackers targeted U.S. airports,[^4] and Chinese-aligned threat actors exploited telecoms’ vulnerabilities.[^5]

The prior year, with most pandemic disruption overcome, CISOs for a brief time appeared to feel a sense of calm, composure and confidence in their security posture. Astoundingly, that feeling has already vanished, replaced by elevated concern.

As we look to 2023 and beyond, we can expect a return to a harsher reality. Ransomware looks set to wreak more disruption as data extortion becomes the rule rather than the exception. At the same time, increasing commercialization of dark-web exploit tools, initial-access brokers and “as-a-service” attack infrastructures threaten to make cyber crime even more open to anyone with a few dollars and ill intent.

Amid growing concerns around cyber risk and organizational preparedness, navigating this threat landscape remains a matter of protecting people and defending data. Modern CISOs know that users are at the center of cybersecurity. And they understand how critical it is to safeguard their organization’s sensitive information, especially in light of an uncertain economy and employee churn.

To gain deeper insight into the mind of the CISO during this pivotal time, Proofpoint surveyed 1,600 of them from around the world. They graciously shared their experiences over the last year and their outlook for the years ahead.

In this summary of our findings, we explore how the global recession is applying pressure to security budgets and how CISOs must remain steadfast in pressing the C-suite for critical controls to protect their organizations. We also learn how boards are increasingly becoming part of the cybersecurity conversation and the impact this is having on their understanding of security issues and their relationships with CISOs. Finally, we unpack the issue of burnout among CISOs as many struggle with the pressures of personal liability and excessive expectations.

Once again, this report would not have been possible without the insight offered by cybersecurity and information security professionals across the globe. We offer our sincere thanks for your time and your feedback.

## Chapter 1: Back to "Business as Usual"

Last year’s report uncovered a palpable feeling among CISOs that there was a period of calm after a once-in-a-generation crisis. With the pandemic disruption finally subsiding and hybrid work setups a mainstay for most, CISOs felt comfortable that the worst was behind them. At the time, just 48% believed that a cyber attack was on the horizon within the coming year.

That’s changing. In this year’s survey, over two-thirds (68%) of CISOs said they feel at risk of a material cyber attack in the next 12 months. This pronounced shift suggests that security professionals see the threat landscape heating up once again, and have recalibrated their level of concern to match.

**68%** of CISOs feel their organization is at risk of experiencing a material cyber attack in the next 12 months, with 25% rating the risk as very likely.

*Percentage of CISOs who agree that their organization is at risk of a material cyber attack in the next 12 months*

| Country      | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
| :----------- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UK           | 84%  | 60%  | 80%  |
| Germany      | 83%  | 40%  | 64%  |
| Singapore    | 80%  | 64%  | 44%  |
| South Korea  | 75%  | 80%  | 34%  |
| UAE          | 75%  | 31%  | 38%  |
| France       | 74%  | 72%  | 72%  |
| U.S.         | 73%  | 28%  | 44%  |
| Spain        | 72%  | 44%  | 27%  |
| Brazil       | 69%  | 68%  | 46%  |
| Japan        | 65%  | 68%  | 81%  |
| Canada       | 58%  | 50%  | 79%  |
| Netherlands  | 58%  | 63%  | 44%  |
| Sweden       | 58%  | 50%  | 68%  |
| KSA          | 55%  | 56%  | 20%  |
| Australia    | 53%  | 78%  | 58%  |
| Italy        | 49%  | 72%  | 64%  |

*   CISOs in the UK (84%), Germany (83%) and Singapore (80%) are most concerned about experiencing a material cyber attack.
*   Italy’s CISOs are the most optimistic, with just 49% fearing an attack.
*   CISOs (68%) and board members (65%) both feel that a material cyber attack is likely in the next 12 months.
*   Retail (77%), manufacturing (76%) and finance (71%) lead the way for cyber attack concerns across industry verticals.

### Awareness vs Preparedness

Increased awareness among CISOs of the danger of a potential cyber attack can be viewed as a positive. But we found a concerning disconnect between the perceived likelihood of such an event and how prepared organizations are to deal with one.

Nearly two-thirds (61%) agree that their organization is unprepared to cope with a targeted cyber attack. Once again, this is above 2022’s figure of 50% and more in line with 2021’s finding of 66%. This is further evidence that CISOs are returning to the “new normal”—though it’s a normal that offers little comfort.

**61%** of CISOs agreed that their organization is unprepared to cope with a targeted cyber attack in 2023.

For their part, board members are much more confident in their organization’s ability to deter cyber threats. In our survey of board members last year, just 47% believed they were unprepared for such an eventuality.[^6] But with CISOs having a better read of security posture and understanding of the threat landscape, this board-level optimism is likely based on an incomplete picture of the current situation.

*A CISO’s eye view of the threat landscape*

*Percentage of CISOs who agree that their organization is unprepared to cope with a targeted cyber attack in 2023*

*   **Top 3 Countries:**
    *   UK: 76%
    *   France: 76%
    *   Brazil: 72%
*   Global Average = 61%

When it comes to the kinds of threats occupying the minds of the world’s CISOs, four major categories lead the way:

*   Email fraud (33%)
*   Insider threats (30%)
*   Cloud account compromise (29%)
*   DDoS attacks (29%)

This list is almost unchanged from the previous year (though email fraud and insider threats swapped places in the top two spots.) CISOs are right to remain concerned about these threats. Their continued prominence as a top priority reflects the challenge they continue to pose.

On a more positive note, CISO concerns seem to be filtering through to the rest of the C-suite; board members agree that email fraud poses the most pressing threat.

*What, if anything, do you perceive to be the biggest cybersecurity threats within your organization/industry in the next 12 months? (Pick up to three.)*

*   33% Email fraud (business email compromise)
*   30% Insider threat (negligent, accidental or criminal)
*   29% Cloud account compromise (Microsoft 365 or G Suite or other)
*   29% Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack
*   27% Ransomware attacks
*   27% Supply chain attacks
*   27% Smishing/Vishing
*   26% Malware

*   Email fraud is the top concern among CISOs in Japan (45%), UAE (45%), France (35%) the UK (34%) and Germany (31%).
*   Insider threats lead the way in Spain (38%), Singapore (35%) and Canada (32%).
*   Among industries, business and professional (39%), public sector (38%), retail (35%) and IT, technology and telecoms (33%) all agree that email fraud will be the biggest threat over the next 12 months.

> Organizations are finally back to ‘business as usual’ following years of coping with the pandemic and its aftermath. CISOs fully understand how critical their supply chains are and the significant impact of cyber-attacks and ransomware on those supply chains. There is a need for a continuous and constantly evolving partnership between companies and their suppliers on the topic of cybersecurity that results in stronger requirements and cyber controls. Working collaboratively across sectors to raise the level of security yields benefits for all and creates greater deterrence for the adversaries.

## Chapter 2: Protecting People—The Cybersecurity Cornerstone

Just as CISOs remain largely unchanged in their view of the threat landscape, they also hold their organization’s employees in a similar light to previous years.

Almost two-thirds (60%) consider human error to be their organization’s biggest cyber vulnerability. This is consistent with our findings in 2022 and 2021. In those studies, 56% and 58%, respectively, agreed with the statement.

An even higher percentage of board directors (67%) shared this view. The finding suggests that the C-suite now, if belatedly, recognizes the threat that CISOs have witnessed firsthand. This newfound awareness can only be good news.

Still, CISOs have expressed similar concerns about human vulnerability for several years now. Clearly, improving confidence in workers’ cybersecurity savviness remains a challenge.

**60%** of CISOs consider human error to be their organization’s biggest cyber vulnerability.

*Percentage of CISOs in agreement that human error is their organization’s biggest cyber vulnerability.*

| Country      | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
| :----------- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UK           | 78%  | 65%  | 78%  |
| Japan        | 75%  | 61%  | 75%  |
| Brazil       | 73%  | 46%  | 48%  |
| Singapore    | 70%  | 56%  | 56%  |
| U.S.         | 69%  | 78%  | 76%  |
| Spain        | 67%  | 53%  | 65%  |
| France       | 66%  | 48%  | 37%  |
| Canada       | 65%  | 58%  | 70%  |
| Netherlands  | 59%  | 62%  | 50%  |
| Australia    | 59%  | 76%  | 59%  |
| KSA          | 56%  | 38%  | 43%  |
| Italy        | 51%  | 56%  | 58%  |
| Germany      | 48%  | 65%  | 69%  |
| South Korea  | 48%  | 75%  | 63%  |

Even more CISOs (63%) agree that human risk more broadly—including malicious and negligent employees—is a key cybersecurity concern in the next two years. This is most keenly felt in the UK, where 78% of CISOs agree, followed by:

*   Japan (75%)
*   Brazil (72%)
*   Singapore (72%)
*   U.S. (68%)
*   Spain (68%)

### The people problem

It is hardly surprising that people risk remains such a prominent concern among CISOs when just 61% believe that employees understand their role in protecting their employer. This leaves 2 in 5 CISOs ill at ease about whether their users are equipped to detect and deter cyber threats.

Once again, this number is consistent with previous findings (60% in 2022 and 58% in 2021). The trend suggests little progress in building a culture of security awareness.

*Countries with the highest percentage of CISOs who agree that “employees understand their role in protecting their organization against cyber threats,” include:*

*   France (79%)
*   Japan (75%)
*   UK (75%)
*   Spain (73%)

**61%** of CISOs believe that their employees understand their role in protecting their organization against cyber threats, with 25% strongly agreeing.

In our earlier survey, board members reported a greater level of confidence. More than 75% agreed that employees understand their role—a concerning disconnect about the perceived security posture of their people.

This is likely because board directors can be sheltered from employees’ day-to-day actions, in many cases interacting only with higher-ranking, well-informed and top-performing workers. By contrast, the CISO rightly has a closer ear to the ground—and a more realistic grasp of cybersecurity awareness and abilities throughout the organization.

*   CISOs in France (79%) have the most confidence that employees understand their role in protecting their organizations.
*   The belief that people are the biggest security vulnerability decreases as company size increases: 61% in those with 200-499 employees and 47% in those with 5,000+.
*   CISOs in retail (76%), transport (67%), IT, technology and telecoms (67%) and finance (67%) are most concerned about people risk over the next two years.

> Research consistently finds that human error is one of the key contributors to successful cyber attacks. As long as this vulnerability remains, CISOs will struggle to protect their data and systems. Although human error is inevitable, having guardrails, as well as strong policies and procedures in place, can go a long way in mitigating this risk and hardening your people perimeter.

## Chapter 3: Defending Data

Protect people, defend data: these are the keys tenets of any effective cybersecurity strategy. But unfortunately, organizations appear to struggle with both.

**63%** Almost two-thirds—63%—of global CISOs say they have had to deal with the loss of sensitive information in the past year. Bearing the brunt of data loss incidents are organizations in energy (71%), business and professional services (68%) and retail (68%).

of global CISOs say their organization has dealt with a material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months.

*Percentage of CISOs whose organizations have dealt with a material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months*

*   2023 Global Average = 63%

*What was the cause of the data loss event? (Pick all that apply.)*
*(Respondents whose organization dealt with a material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months)*

For most, data loss came about as a result of an operating system (OS) vulnerability on endpoint, server or device (36%), an external attack (35%), system misconfiguration (35%) or negligent insider (34%).

And the consequences of data loss are as far reaching as the causes. Most CISOs report post-attack recovery costs such operational downtime and data recovery (38%), financial loss (33%) and regulatory sanctions (33%).

*What was the end result of the event on your organization? (Pick all that apply.)*
*(Respondents whose organization dealt with a material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months)*

*   38% Post-attack recovery costs (operational downtime, data recovery, legal, etc.)
*   33% Financial loss
*   33% Regulatory sanctions (fines or market loss/sanctions)
*   31% Loss of critical data
*   31% Credential theft
*   31% Loss of customers
*   31% Reputational damage

### Spotlight on malicious insiders

Although insider negligence edged out malicious and compromised users as the leading cause of data loss events last year, CISOs expect a reversal in the year ahead. Malicious (43%) and compromised (40%) insiders are deemed more likely to cause a data breach or exposure in the next 12 months. The finding suggests that CISOs increasingly believe that more employees are exposing data on purpose. The continuing impact of the Great Resignation—and more recently, mass layoffs—undoubtedly loom large in this assertion.

Many industries saw a significant increase in post-pandemic staff turnover. Some 82% of CISOs report that employees leaving their organization has contributed to a data loss event. The two sectors affected the most were retail (90%) and IT, technology and telecoms (88%).

These trends leave security teams with a near-impossible challenge. When people leave, stopping them from taking data is difficult.

Some organizations require written guarantees from former employees that they will delete all company data. Others threaten the new employer of potential liability if the employee shares any data from the old job. But neither is close to being a satisfactory solution.

**82%** of CISOs agree that employees leaving their organization played a role in a data loss event.

> Organizations typically deploy a variety of security solutions and mitigating controls to protect against the loss of sensitive data, but they often overlook one factor—employees who leave for greener pastures often take the data with them. CISOs can’t solve this problem with technical controls alone, and this is where a strong security culture comes in. Educating employees, setting the expectations, garnering senior business leadership support—and then adding procedures and controls around it—can mitigate and eliminate some of the most common data leak problems.

### Dealing with data loss

Against a backdrop of constant data loss across industries and countries, 60% of CISOs still contend that they have adequate data protections in place.

Board members are even more confident, with 75% believing this to be the case. However, this may due to CISOs sharing with them a well-presented picture of events rather than the unfiltered reality.

Despite confidence in their current abilities, information protection and data governance remain a top priority going forward for 61% of the world’s CISOs. That’s a slight increase from 59% last year.

Once again, board members feel more strongly, with 75% in agreement. Again, this is likely because of their limited view—board members focus on top-line concerns rather than the numerous security issues CISOs deal with throughout the year.

**60%** of CISOs agree that the data within their organization is adequately protected.

When it comes to the tools and protocols making up cyber defense, most CISOs report a broad and varied arsenal.

*What protocols do you have in place to combat organizational data loss?*

*   39% We educate employees on data security best practices
*   36% We have a cloud security solution in place (example: CASB)
*   36% We have isolation technology which avoids employees entering credentials on web forms
*   35% We have a data loss prevention (DLP) agent in place
*   35% We have email security technology in place
*   35% We have endpoint security technology in place

*   87% of organizations in Sweden dealt with material data loss in the last year—the highest rate of any country surveyed.
*   Insider negligence is the leading cause of data loss in Brazil (54%), Japan (48%) and Singapore (40%).
*   Loss of critical data (36%) and reputational damage (36%) are the biggest consequences of data loss for large organizations (5,000+ employees).
*   Smaller organizations (200-499 employees) are most impacted by post-attack recovery costs (46%).

## Chapter 4: Building a Defense to Fight on Every Front

Today’s CISOs face a fight on multiple fronts. They must combat external threats such as ransomware and supply chain risk to malicious, negligent and compromised insiders. For the most part, CISOs feel they have adequate resources to wage such a war. But many remain woefully overexposed.

As supply chains grow larger and more complex, protecting these increasingly opaque networks is more difficult than ever.

In spite of this, most CISOs say they have the issue under control. Some 64% believe they have appropriate controls in place to mitigate supply chain risk. This represents a modest increase from 2022 (59%), demonstrating that the issue remains a top priority.

When it comes to more direct attacks on their organization, CISOs are increasingly prepared to rely on insurers to limit the damage. Almost two-thirds (61%) said they would place a claim on cyber insurance policies to recover losses incurred. Retail (75%) and IT, technology and telecoms (65%) are most likely to mitigate financial losses in this way.

The World Economic Forum reports that 71% of organizations have cyber insurance in place,[^7] so this finding is no surprise. But relying on such policies alone is growing more complicated.

For one, a recent increase in claims has led many insurers to raise premiums; some are withdrawing coverage for common threats like ransomware altogether.[^8] What’s more, while insurance can offer some financial compensation in the event of a data breach, it does little to rebuild customer trust or company reputation.

This, along with an increase in more sophisticated and devastating ransomware attacks, may be why CISOs are increasingly open to paying ransoms to cyber criminals.

Just 14% disagree that their organization is likely to pay a ransom to restore systems or prevent the release of data in the next 12 months; 62% say the opposite.

*   Retail: 73%
*   Public sector: 68%
*   IT, technology and telecoms: 65%
*   Financial services: 65%

Most CISOs (62%) are confident that their organization can detect and remove a threat actor using stolen or compromised credentials before any material damage occurs. Just 14% disagree.

This confidence is likely misplaced. While most organizations may have adequate endpoint detection and response technology, such tools will not alert on compromised credentials.

### Spotlight on budgets and priorities

With a look to the future, CISOs’ priorities for the next two years are largely unchanged from last year’s report. The desire to innovate (39%), consolidate (37%) and outsource (35%) aspects of cybersecurity remain strong. The numbers underline a commitment to these transformational long-term projects.

*What are the top priorities for your organization’s IT security department over the next two years? (Pick up to three.)*

*   39% Improving information protection and data classification, Enabling business innovation (example: DevSecOps, product development)
*   37% Consolidation and/or simplification of security solutions and controls
*   35% Outsourcing security controls
*   34% Addressing insider threats
*   34% Improving employee cybersecurity awareness
*   33% Addressing supplier risk

But a global economic downturn could make it more challenging for many organizations to achieve these aims. Over half (58%) of CISOs agree that recent economic events have hit their cybersecurity budget. The two sectors most affected are the public sector and IT, technology and telecoms (65% of CISOs in both reporting budget cuts).

No one can control global market forces. Still, organizations must not make rash budgetary decisions when concerns about cybersecurity preparedness are on the rise. CISOs must have a seat at the table when boards set spending priorities.

**58%** of global CISOs say the current economic downturn has negatively impacted their organization’s cybersecurity budget.

*   CISOs in retail (76%) are most confident that their organization has appropriate controls in place to mitigate supply chain risk.
*   CISOs in the UK (79%), France (73%) and Sweden (73%) are most likely to rely on cyber insurance to cover losses.
*   Ransoms are most likely to be paid by CISOs in the UK (75%), Japan (73%) and Brazil (73%).
*   UK (73%), Brazil (73%) and U.S. (67%) CISOs believe their budgets have been most negatively impacted by the economic downturn.
*   CISOs in retail (69%), public sector (65%) and IT, technology and telecoms (65%) are the industries most impacted by the economic downturn.

> It is imperative to have alignment with leadership on the need to provide resources that maintain a robust cybersecurity program, even when dealing with a difficult business climate. Our adversaries do not stop in an economic downturn—on the contrary, they step up their efforts knowing that organizations may put fewer resources into their defenses. Maintaining solid cybersecurity protections is always paramount because the threat landscape will only continue to expand.

## Chapter 5: Boards and CISOs—Closer to the Same Page

The issue of CISO and board member alignment is not new. But as the CISO role takes on greater influence, board-level interactions are more frequent—and relations appear to be improving as a result.

A little under two-thirds (62%) of CISOs agree that their board sees eye to eye with them on cybersecurity issues. That’s up from 59% in 2021 and 51% in 2022. For their part, board members are even more positive about the relationship, with 69% feeling the same way.

As CISOs feel more at risk of a cyber attack and less prepared to cope with the consequences, they are beginning to feel more in tune with their boards—an encouraging sign. Both, no doubt, hope this trend can continue. And perhaps the slight drop in perceived positive relations in 2022 was little more than late-pandemic stress and strain.

**62%** of CISOs say their board sees eye-to-eye with them on the issue of cybersecurity.

*Percentage of CISOs by industry who agree their board sees eye to eye with them on the issue of cybersecurity.*

*   Retail: 71%
*   Manufacturing and production: 66%
*   Public sector: 64%
*   IT, technology and telecoms: 63%
*   Media, leisure and entertainment: 62%
*   Business and professional services: 61%
*   Healthcare: 58%
*   Financial services: 57%
*   Energy, oil/gas and utilities: 55%
*   Education: 52%
*   Transport: 50%

Even though relations are burgeoning, a slight disconnect remains around the consequences of a cyber attack. Based on their interactions, CISOs believe their boards’ greatest concerns to be:

*   Reputational damage (36%)
*   Impact on business valuation (36%)
*   Loss of current customers (36%)

While all of these concerns are valid, they are slightly out of step with the top real-world impacts of data loss:

*   Operational downtime and data recovery (38%)
*   Financial loss (33%)
*   Regulatory sanctions (33%)

That said, many of the concerns held by CISOs and board members are interlinked. Operational downtime leads to reputational damage, impact on business valuation and loss of customers.

*Given your interactions with the board, what do you believe are their greatest concerns with regard to a material cyber attack on the business? (Pick up to three.)*
