## Introduction

In 2023, the cloud is fundamentally delivering on its promised business outcomes, including flexible capacity and scalability, increased agility, improved availability, and accelerated deployment and provisioning.

However, security concerns remain a critical barrier to cloud adoption, showing little signs of improvement in the perception of cloud security professionals. Cloud adoption is further inhibited by a number of related challenges that prevent the faster and broader embracement of cloud services, including the continued lack of cloud security talent, proliferating compliance requirements, and the significant lack of visibility and control, especially in hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

This 2023 Cloud Security Report surveyed 752 cybersecurity professionals to reveal key challenges and priorities, including:

*   Cloud security continues to be a significant issue, with 95% of surveyed organizations concerned about their security posture in public cloud environments. Misconfiguration remains the biggest cloud security risk, according to 59% of cybersecurity professionals. This is closely followed by exfiltration of sensitive data and insecure interfaces/APIs (tied at 51%), and unauthorized access (49%).
*   Despite economic headwinds, cloud security budgets are increasing for the majority of organizations (60%) by an average of 33%.
*   44% of organizations are looking for ways to achieve better visibility and control in securing hybrid and multi-cloud networks, with 90% looking for a single cloud security platform to protect data consistently and comprehensively across their cloud footprint.

We would like to thank Fortinet for supporting this important industry research project. We hope you’ll find this report informative and helpful as you continue your efforts to secure your organization’s cloud journey against evolving threats.

Thank you,

### Barriers to Cloud Adoption

While the cloud offers important advantages, significant barriers to cloud adoption still exist. The biggest challenges organizations are facing are not primarily about technology, but people and processes. Most critical is the perennial lack of qualified staff (37%), which continues to be the largest impediment to faster adoption, despite dropping slightly from last year. This is closely followed by legal and regulatory compliance (30%), data security issues (29%), and integration with existing IT environments (27%).

What are the biggest barriers holding back cloud adoption in your organization?

Lack of staff resources or expertise: 37%
Legal and regulatory compliance: 30%

### Public Cloud Security Concerns

Despite increasing cloud adoption, cloud security concerns show no signs of improving. Virtually all surveyed organizations are moderately to extremely concerned about their security posture in public cloud environments (95%). The number of organizations that are extremely concerned about public cloud security even increased this year — 35%, up from 32%.

How concerned are you about the security of public clouds?

95% of organizations are moderately to extremely concerned about cloud security.
41% are extremely concerned.
35% are very concerned.
19% are moderately concerned.
4% are slightly concerned.

### Risk of a Breach

Concerns about public cloud security, combined with a lack of resources and expertise, are driving the perception that the risk of a security breach in the public cloud is higher than in traditional on-premises environments (43%). Only 27% of security professionals perceive risk to be lower in a public cloud environment.

Compared to traditional, on-premises IT environments, would you say the risk of security breaches in a public cloud environment is higher or lower?

43% say public cloud risk is somewhat to significantly higher than on-premises.
30% say public cloud risk is about the same.
20% say public cloud risk is somewhat lower.
7% say public cloud risk is significantly lower.
