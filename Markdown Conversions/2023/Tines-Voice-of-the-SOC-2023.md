## A word from Eoin Hinchy

### A word from Eoin Hinchy

CEO and Co-Founder, Tines

Security teams are getting restless.

Before founding Tines, I spent 15 years in
the SOC leading teams charged with
protecting organizations from ever-evolving
threats. Over that time, the challenge facing
SOC analysts became harder, not easier:
workloads are increasing, but teams aren’t
growing alongside them. SOC analysts are
burning out as a result of tedious and
repetitive tasks. In the best-case scenario,
staff will leave in search of new opportunities
and leave their previous organizations
scrambling to replace them. In the worst case,
their burnout will lead to human error that
could cost a company millions.

Last year, we examined these issues in detail
in our first “Voice of the SOC Analyst” report.
Our survey found that while SOC teams were
passionate and engaged in what they do,
they were plagued by endless manual tasks,
inefficient processes, and overwhelming alert
fatigue — all preventing them from focusing
on high-impact work. The same holds true in
2023.

For the second edition of the “Voice of the
SOC,” Tines surveyed 900 security
professionals. We expanded the scope
beyond the United States to include Europe
and sought perspectives from security
leaders up to and including the C-suite, rather
than just analysts.

Like many, security teams have felt the added
pressure of economic instability over the past
12 months. They were asked to do more with
less, as business leaders scrutinized every line
on the balance sheet.

This year’s data reveals that overall job
satisfaction in the SOC remains high —
security practitioners love the work they do.
However, burnout is taking its toll. Leaders
continue to feel their teams are understaffed
and don’t have access to the tools that could
automate the most mundane aspects of their
work. The bottom line: more than half of
respondents, across job levels, say they’re
likely to switch jobs in the coming year.

This should be an alarm bell to business
leaders. With both cyberattacks and skill
shortages increasing, staff retention in the
SOC is mission critical. The following report
digs into the factors that undermine morale
and offers practical solutions to help alleviate
burnout and empower staff to do their
best work.

We hope you find it useful in your SOC in 2023
and as you plan for 2024.

## Key findings

Here are a few of the insights we learned from
the security professionals we surveyed:

### #1
63% of practitioners experience
some level of burnout.

With more than 80% saying their workloads
have increased in the past year, the problem is
only getting worse.

### #2
55% say they’re likely to switch jobs
in the next year.

Organizations could increase retention by
increasing salaries, supplying modern tools
with advanced capabilities, hiring more staff,
and investing in solutions that automate
tedious, manual tasks.

### #3
Spending time on manual work is the
most frustrating aspect of the job.

If respondents had to spend less time on
manual tasks, they would most likely use that
time to research and evaluate new tools,
develop more advanced detection rules, and
integrate more systems and logs.

### #4
There’s hope in
automation.

Nine out of ten security teams are automating
at least some of their work, and 93% of
respondents believe that more automation
would improve their work-life balance.
Respondents expect automation to help their
teams increase productivity, save time, and
optimize performance and reliability.

### #5
Security practitioners are
learning to code.

Security teams now consider learning to code
— along with computer forensics and malware
analysis techniques — most important to
succeed, likely because of coding’s key role in
automation. No-code security solutions could
provide similar benefits as organizations
automate repetitive tasks.

## Chapter 1 • Job satisfaction and workloads

### Chapter 1

### Job satisfaction
and workloads

Security teams enjoy the work they do and feel
appreciated by the organization. But all is not well in
the SOC — burnout and understaffing threaten
stability and security. To better understand how
leaders can fix the challenges at play, we first must
take stock of how security teams are feeling today.

### Job satisfaction

#### 99% are satisfied with
their job

Overall job satisfaction is up among
security teams this year. The number of
respondents satisfied with their current
job rose from 88% last year to 99% in
2023. 54% are very satisfied this year.

#### 98% are engaged with
their work

Analysts aren’t just satisfied — they’re
locked in. 50% of respondents are very
engaged with their work, and 98% are
at least somewhat engaged.

#### 99% feel respected by their
peers outside the SOC

Security teams may sometimes feel like
they are working in the shadows as they
defend their organizations against
threats, but their hard work does not go
unnoticed. Almost all (99%) of
respondents said they feel respected by
their peers outside of the SOC team,
and 52% feel very respected.

### Workloads

#### 63% are experiencing some
level of burnout at work

Despite 99% saying they’re satisfied
with their job, nearly two thirds (63%) of
respondents said they feel burned out
at work. One in five feel very burned out.
We’ll uncover some of the reasons for
this shortly, along with ways to help SOC
teams join the 37% who say they do not
feel burned out at work.

#### 50% say their SOC team is
understaffed

For 81%, workloads have
increased over the past year

Half of our respondents said their team
is currently understaffed, and staffing
problems are tied closely to burnout. Of
those who felt understaffed, nearly four
in five (79%) are burned out, compared
to just 47% of those who felt they
currently have the right amount of staff
for their needs.

One of the reasons for burnout could be
that 81% had more work than ever over
the past year. This was particularly true
in the United States, where 39% said
their workload had increased
substantially, compared to 22% in
Europe. Just 2% of overall respondents
said their workload had decreased.

SOC teams love what they do. The majority of
respondents report feeling satisfied with their
jobs, engaged in their work, and respected by
their colleagues in other departments. They
also indicated they are paid what they
deserve, with 96% feeling fairly compensated.

However, 63% are experiencing some level of
burnout at work, and many security teams
feel understaffed and overburdened by ever-
increasing workloads. These issues can lead
to employee churn, even among those who
love their jobs. In the next sections, we’ll take
a closer look at the factors that have helped
retain respondents who would otherwise look
for new opportunities.

### Top three skills needed to
succeed as an analyst

- 15% Computer forensics techniques
  Knowing how to recover data from crashed servers and drives after an
  incident is a key step in uncovering what went wrong in the failure or
  attack.
- 14% Learning to code
  Being able to code can help in task automation, which alleviates some
  of the most tedious processes. There are also no-code automation
  options that allow teams to focus on security analysis.
- 14% Malware analysis techniques
  SOC teams must be able to examine malicious software to reveal its
  purpose and potential impact on their systems.
- 11% Threat hunting techniques
- 9% Obtaining high-level training and certifications
- 9% Operationalizing Mitre ATT&CK
- 9% Advanced query language techniques
- 7% Keeping up to date on threat actors’ TTPs
- 7% Learning penetration testing
- 4% SOAR integration

## Chapter 2 • Where time goes

### Chapter 2

### Where
time goes

We know security teams are frustrated by time
spent on tedious tasks, and this repetitive work
prevents them from engaging in the improvements
that will enhance their organization’s security
posture. In this section, we find out exactly what
these necessary but mundane tasks are, and learn
more about the internal metrics guiding this time
management.

### Top five time-
consuming tasks

- 18% Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)
  The number one most time-consuming task is SOAR, likely because
  nearly every current SOAR tool uses an app-based integration model
  which relies on limited pre-built integrations and often requires teams
  to build their own custom apps. Direct integrations can address these
  challenges.
- 17% Troubleshooting system errors/system maintenance
  Troubleshooting and maintenance take up a significant amount of
  time, preventing teams from doing the proactive work that could
  improve security postures.
- 16% Intelligence (i.e. researching threat actors, TTPs, ATT&CK)
  Teams are also spending time researching threat actors — including
  their tactics, techniques, and procedures — and operationalizing the
  MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- 15% Monitoring
  Respondents are spending valuable time monitoring for threats and
  alerts, despite the fact that respondents over the practitioner level
  should not be doing front-line monitoring.
- 15% Managing a knowledge base/operational documentation
  Documentation rounds out the top five tasks — ensuring all essential
  documents are stored, backed up, and eventually discarded when
  they’re no longer needed.

Lower on the list, you’ll find more proactive, higher-impact tasks like managing IOCs
and modifying alert rules — tasks that SOC would likely prefer to prioritize. One task
that saw a steep decline this year? Reporting.

- 13% Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- 12% Communicating (email, phone, messenger, etc)
- 11% Detecting (including intrusion detection)
- 11% Responding to security incidents
- 11% Vulnerability/compliance
  scanning (e.g. Nessus) and
  patching
- 9% Malware analysis/forensics
- 8% Threat hunting
- 8% Evaluating new vendors/
  products/services
- 8% Log analysis
- 8% Operations/ShiftOps
- 7% Tracking
- 7% Compliance and audits
- 7% Modifying alert rules
- 6% Penetration testing, Red
  teaming, Purple teaming, etc.
- 6% Reporting
- 5% Phishing triage/response
- 5% Recovery
- 4% Containment
- 3% Managing IOCs

### Top four tasks security
teams enjoy the least

- 18% Communicating (email, phone, Slack, etc.)
  One of the two tasks which respondents enjoyed the least was
  communicating. Slack notifications come for us all, but there are ways
  to automate communications internally and externally and increase
  transparency on shared projects.
- 18% Reporting
  The other top choice was reporting. Reporting matters, but it’s reactive
  — collecting what happened after an incident — rather than proactive.
  Streamlining the reporting process through automation frees up
  security practitioners to focus on analysis and increases job
  satisfaction.
- 10% Monitoring
  Monitoring, one of the most time-consuming tasks, is also one of the
  least enjoyable. Much of this type of manual front-line monitoring can
  be automated.
- 10% Responding to security incidents
  As you’ll see below, teams are judged on their ability to respond to
  incidents. It should be noted that 14% of respondents named this type of
  response their most enjoyable task — including 22% of VPs and above,
  suggesting a split between analysts and leaders on the task.
- 9% Triaging
- 9% Threat hunting
- 8% Tracking
- 6% Intrusion detection
- 6% Detecting
- 6% Operations/ShiftOps

### Top four key metrics used to
measure job performance

What key metrics are used to measure a
security team’s job performance? In other
words, what metrics should SOC teams
prioritize to improve team performance?

When we asked this question last year, the
top five responses were mean time to
investigate (54.1%), number of alerts (43.8%),
mean time to respond (40%), time to detect
(37.6%), and number of incidents handled
(34.2%). Four of those answers cracked the
top five again this year, with only the
number of alerts falling off — possibly
because security teams are learning that an
avalanche of alerts is an impediment to
success, not a marker of it.

- 36% Mean time to investigate (MTTI)
  The average amount of time between when a problem is
  detected and when the security team begins to investigate it.
  Successful SOC teams reduce the intervening window.
- 36% Time to detect
  The time it takes an organization to discover an incident. SOC
  teams need solutions in place to identify issues quickly and
  catch zero-day vulnerabilities.
- 36% Number of incidents handled
  SOC teams are measured by the amount of incidents they
  resolve successfully. They can slash this figure by implementing
  faster and more thorough alert and resolution tools.
- 36% Mean time to respond
  The average time it takes to resolve an incident completely.
  Automation can help security teams investigate and remediate
  threats and return a system to operation after a failure.
- 33% Adherence to SOW/SOP/KBs
  (Statements of Work,
  Standard Operating
  Procedure, Knowledge Base
  articles)
- 33% Percentage of
  recurring incidents
- 31% Time to containment
- 31% Adherence to Service Level
  Agreements (SLAs)
- 30% Number of alerts
- 28% Rules or detections created
  or enhanced
- 28% Percentage of
  escalated events
- 28% Knowledge base/wiki articles
  created or enhanced
- 26% Time to eradication
- 25% False positives identified and
  reduced
- 22% False positive rate

### Where you can find them

As a fun aside, we asked our participants which conferences they’re aware
of or have attended in the past two years. If you’re looking for your peers,
your best bet is AWS re:Inforce, followed by Black Hat and AWS re:Invent.

- AWS re:Inforce 39%
- Black Hat 37%
- AWS re:Invent 35%
- InfoSec 27%
- DefCon 27%
- BSides 24%
- RSA 19%
- None of the above 13%

Our respondents reveal that their time is mostly spent on necessary but tedious
tasks like operating imperfect SOAR tools, troubleshooting system errors, and front-
line monitoring (which is also one of the tasks they enjoy least). Effective automation
can help maximize a SOC team’s time and improve the metrics — including time to
detect, investigate, and respond — that they are measured against.

## Chapter 3 • Barriers to good work

### Chapter 3

### Barriers to
good work

Security teams want to do their best work — they’re
passionate about protecting their organizations and
highly engaged in their roles.

Let’s take a look at some of the other obstacles
that SOC teams encounter.

15

### Top three challenges

We wanted to better understand the primary pain points for SOC
teams, so we asked respondents to rank their teams’ top day-to-day
challenges. The following ranked in the top five most frequently.

- 37% Too much data, not enough information
  Security teams are drowning in data but struggle to turn that
  data into actionable insights.
- 36% Time spent on manual tasks
  As we’ve seen elsewhere, tedious tasks — like reporting, monitoring,
  and detection — are a daily challenge.
- 34% Too many reporting requirements
  Reporting is one of the least popular tasks, likely because of its
  arduous requirements.
- 31% Too many logs
- 30% Compliance
- 30% Too many alerts
- 29% System downtime
- 28% High staff turnover rate
- 28% Lack of training
- 28% Understaffed
- 26% Tools don’t integrate
- 26% Poor processes
- 25% Clunky, outdated, or misconfigured tools
- 25% Leadership issues
- 23% Restrictive SLAs
- 23% Teams are very siloed
- 22% Poor visibility into our environment
- 17% Boredom

### Top five things that frustrate
security teams the most

- 53% Spending time on manual work
  No one likes doing tedious work, and a majority of respondents
  feel, or their team feels, frustrated by repetitive, manual tasks.
- 49% Too many different consoles/tools to investigate incidents
  Tool consolidation was a trend this year across the tech industry,
  but its effects haven’t yet taken hold in security. Fragmented
  toolsets could lead to gaps in an organization’s response.
- 47% High cost of security and log management software
  All those tools don’t come cheap.
- 45% Lack of unified query language to access all data across all
  monitored systems
  Security teams are swapping screens, tools, and languages to
  access all their distributed data.
- 44% Poor integration of different security tools
  When tools don’t integrate well, it creates unnecessary friction
  within teams and between business units.
- 43% Inaccurate or incomplete attribution
- 42% High false positive rates
- 42% Slow or delayed log file ingestion and processing
- 41% Lack of broad support for different log types and systems
- 34% Toxic work environment/personnel issues
- 34% Lack of space for logs
- 27% Our SIEM

### Lack of time, budget, and
effective tools are inhibiting
SOC teams

Overall, what prevents the SOC team from doing their best work? In a word:
resources. Our respondents, selecting all that applied, said a lack of time
(42%) was the top factor holding them back, followed by lack of budget
(39%), lack of effective tools (39%), and lack of people (35%).

- 42% Lack of time
- 39% Lack of budget
- 39% Lack of effective tools
- 14% Lack of people
- 31% Lack of buy-in from management or the rest of the organization
- 31% Lack of skills
- 31% Interpersonal challenges between team members
- 1% Other

SOC teams identified three clear challenges
preventing them from doing their best work:
too much data, too many tedious tasks, and
too many reporting requirements. These pain
points are amplified by a lack of time, budget,
tools, and people.

Automation offers a path forward for security
leaders to remove obstacles and refocus their
teams on proactive, high-impact work. No-
code tools can help teams catch up quickly,
keeping their organizations safe and possibly
keeping their teams intact as well.

## Chapter 4 • Automation — friend or foe

### Chapter 4

### Automation —
friend or foe

Business leaders are focused on streamlining
processes and achieving operational efficiencies.
They’ve found an effective way to do so in
automation. But how do they feel about
automation? Are they embracing the technology?

Nearly all security teams have already adopted
automation to some extent. This is especially true in
Ireland, where 44% of respondents said much of
their work is automated, the highest percentage
among the countries we surveyed.

#### What best describes your team’s adoption of
security automation tools?

- Much of our work is automated 57%
- Some of our work is automated 35%
- Very little of our work is automated today 6%
- None of our work is automated 1%

#### SOC teams are excited about
automation’s effect on their lives

A stunning 93% of respondents agreed that
automation at their workplace would improve their
work/life balance.

#### Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with
the following statement: “Automation at my
workplace will improve my work/life balance.”

- Strongly agree 56%
- Somewhat agree 37%
- Neither agree nor disagree 5%
- Somewhat disagree 1%
- Strongly disagree 1%

#### 25% spend more than half their time
on tedious manual work

While tedious manual work is still an obstacle for
security teams, they are making strides in this area.
In 2022, 64% of surveyed analysts reported
spending over half their time on such work. This
year, that number fell to 25%.

#### What percentage of your or your teams’ time would
you describe as tedious manual work?

- 10–24% 35%
- 25–49% 32%
- < 10% 20%
- 50–74% 7%
- 75–100% 1%

20

#### 56% fear automation will
eliminate their job

More than half of respondents worry that
automation will eliminate jobs in the near future.
This figure is down from 69% last year, which may
reflect a growing understanding of how jobs could
evolve after automating manual tasks.

#### How worried are you that automation will eliminate
your job/your co-workers jobs in the near future?

- Not worried at all 31%
- Not very worried 27%
- Somewhat worried 17%
- Worried 13%
- Very worried 12%

#### SOC teams recognize automation
could have an immediate impact

Only 3% of respondents believe less than 10% of
security work could be automated by software
currently available. More than a third said that half
to all of the work could be done by today’s
automation solutions.

#### What percentage of your work do you believe
could be done/automated by software that’s
available today?

- 50–74% 36%
- 75–100% 22%
- 25–49% 7%
- 10-24% 3%
- <10% 1%

### Top five tasks SOC teams
would automate to save time

- 17% Intelligence analysis
  The task SOC teams most want to automate would ensure
  alerts arrive with richer, more actionable context, saving
  valuable time spent tracking that information down manually.
- 12% Threat hunting
  This would automate manual efforts to smoke out hackers or data
  that indicates a system may have been breached.
- 11% Endpoint detection and response
  Survey respondents want to use automation to detect and
  investigate threats on endpoints.
- 11% Risk assessments
  This was the top answer in last year's report. SOC teams would
  love to automate these assessments rather than manually
  monitoring for and triaging risk.
- 10% Vulnerability management
  This process — identifying, assessing, reporting on, and
  remediating vulnerabilities — rounds out the top five.
- 9% Advanced triage
- 8% Email phishing
- 8% Attack surface management
- 6% Patching
- 5% Initial triage
- 4% Abuse response

### What would SOC teams do
if parts of their work was
automated?

- 45% Research and evaluate new tools
  Respondents welcome the opportunity to spend more time
  finding the best tools for their teams.
- 44% Develop advanced detection rules
  These rules help enhance an organization’s security posture and
  improve their key performance metrics.
- 38% Integrate more systems and logs
  Bringing these sources of data together is a key proactive
  action with long-term performance benefits.
- 37% Research TTPs more/intelligence
  Respondents want more time to dive deep on threat actor
  tactics, techniques, and procedures.
- 37% Update reports and dashboards
  In the absence of manual work, SOC teams would focus on
  keeping reports and dashboards up-to-date. This indicates
  they are currently behind, and the first order of business after

### SOC teams and their
tools

Our respondents would love to spend more time researching and evaluating
tools, rather than doing tedious tasks. On the subject of tools, they feel like
they have access to the best available — probably because they are involved
in the evaluation process. Three out of four respondents have found a
security solution and added it to the organization’s toolkit.

#### Do you have access to the best
tools possible?

- Yes 84%
- No 16%

#### How involved are you in evaluating the
software tools your team uses?

- Very involved - we have a lot of influence over the process 58%
- Involved 26%
- Somewhat involved 13%
- Not very involved 3%
- Not involved at all - management just gives us the tools (0%)

In this section, we learned that nearly all
security teams have already adopted
automation — and they’re excited about its
impact on work-life balance. We previously
established that the SOC feels understaffed
and overworked under a deluge of alerts and
manual tasks. Now, we’ve identified the tasks
that security professionals wish they could
automate to save time, and the high-impact
tasks — like researching new tools and
developing advanced detection rules — that
they would work on instead if automation was
deployed to full effect.

Automate the present tedium, and security
teams can anticipate the threats of tomorrow.
Given time, they could focus on protecting the
business with insights from integrated
systems and enhanced research and reporting
capabilities.

### Improving
retention

Burnout is a real issue for SOC teams, and the current economic pressures are only making the job harder. We wanted to know if SOC teams were considering career moves — and what organizations could do to retain them.

### How likely are you to
switch jobs in the next 12 months?

- Likely 29%
- Somewhat likely 22%
- Very likely 17%
- Not likely at all 17%
- Not very likely 15%

We know SOC teams are frustrated by manual work and poorly
integrated tools, so it’s no surprise that more than half of respondents
are at least somewhat likely to leave for a new job in the next year.

### Top three ways to
improve retention

As SOC teams eye the door, we asked our respondents about the actions
their organizations could take to keep them on board. The top answer was
to simply pay more — no surprises there. Despite over 96% of respondents
reporting they feel fairly compensated, they still feel a pay increase would
help keep them around. But security teams also pointed to other factors:
supplying more modern tools with advanced capabilities; hiring more
people; and providing tools that automate the tedious manual tasks that
have them looking elsewhere.

#### What could your current organization do to retain you or your team?

- Pay more 49%
- Provide
