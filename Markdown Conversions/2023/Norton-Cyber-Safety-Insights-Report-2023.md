## Survey Method

The research was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of Gen among 8,022 adults (aged 18+) in 8 countries. The survey was conducted November 29 – December 19, 2022 in Australia (n=1,006), France (n=1,002), Germany (n=1,000), India (n=1,000), Japan (n=1,005), New Zealand (n=1,003), the United Kingdom (n=1,005), and the United States (n=1,001).

Data are weighted where necessary to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population; India was weighted to the population of those who are online. Weighted variables varied by country and included one or more of the following: age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, internet usage, household size, household income, size of place, and propensity to be online. A global post-weight was applied to ensure equal weight of each country in the global total.

Throughout the report, references to YOY changes represent differences in results from the 2022 Global NCSIR Study, conducted online by the Harris Poll on behalf of Gen among 10,003 adults aged 18+ in 10 countries from November 15 – December 7, 2021.

Population projection estimates cited are calculated based on adult population (age 18+) figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 International Data Base and Pew Research Center 2019 Global Attitudes Survey.

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, global sample data is accurate to within + 1.4 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. The table below provides accuracy ranges for country level data:

AU + 3.6 percentage points
FR + 4.0 percentage points
DE + 3.6 percentage points
IN + 4.3 percentage points
JP + 3.6 percentage points
NZ + 4.2 percentage points
UK + 3.6 percentage points
