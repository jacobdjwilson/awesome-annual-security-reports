## Defining “Hacker”

If you were to ask 10 people off the street whether they could distinguish between hackers and cybercriminals, they’d likely be unable to do so.

Merriam-Webster defines a “hacker” as “an expert at programming and solving problems with a computer.”

While “hacker” is the predominant self-descriptor used by the cybersecurity community (with even some CISOs we know adopting the moniker), this benevolent term has sadly become synonymous with malice. The bad guys also call themselves hackers, and unfortunately, they get most of the attention.

Here at Bugcrowd (and in this report), we refer to the good guys as hackers. Other terms you may have heard include “ethical hackers,” “white hat hackers,” and “security researchers.”

## Letter from the Editor

An introduction from our CEO David Gerry

Celebrating hackers is at the core of what we do at Bugcrowd. I’ve witnessed so much change over the past decade when it comes to perceptions of the hacking community.

Years ago, hackers were almost exclusively assumed to be criminals. Now, most security professionals not only understand the difference between threat actors and hackers, but they actually have personal experience with ethical hacking.

This is the eighth year in a row that we’ve published *Inside the Mind of a Hacker*, and we’ve covered some really compelling subjects over the years. From neurodiversity in the hacking community to the rise of hacking influencer platforms, we’ve examined a broad spectrum of important topics.

Originally, we published *Inside the Mind of a Hacker* with the goal of breaking through dated hacker stereotypes. As perceptions changed, this report seized the opportunity to do something different; it now focuses on highlighting what’s next for the hacking community. What trends are we seeing? What unique directions are hackers taking in their security research? How can Bugcrowd customers and the greater cybersecurity community benefit from these shifts?

In the last edition, Bugcrowd provided an exclusive first look into how the hacking community is leveraging generative AI as a tool. Owing to its widespread adoption, generative AI was suddenly a topic of conversation everywhere. But we noticed something interesting this year when analyzing the data provided by almost 1300 hacker survey respondents. There is no denying that AI is still top of mind for many, but a surprising trend surfaced: the increasing prominence of hardware hacking.

At first glance, nothing might seem further from the abstract world of AI than the concrete world of hardware hacking. However, consider the infrastructure needed to support the growing demands of AI and complex applications. In our distributed computing world, it’s easy to forget that the cloud is made of iron. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are in our homes. Autonomous vehicles are on the streets. Technology is in our pockets and wearable on our wrists. Hardware powers everything, and that hardware needs to be secure.

Beyond the tie-ins between hardware hacking and AI as a target, AI is also seen as a tool. Hardware hackers can use AI for educational purposes, such as when deciding what frequency to try for a fault injection on a device.

I’ve personally had the privilege of attending several Bug Bashes, where I’ve witnessed firsthand expert hardware hackers combining technology with the hands-on ingenuity of humans. They’re taking machines apart, turning them upside down, and breaking them down, all while running automation programs, pulling apart code, and testing gaps in technology. It’s truly the perfect union between innovative technology and human ingenuity, which is something we’re really passionate about at Bugcrowd.

*Inside the Mind of a Hacker* spotlights the immense power that the hacker community can unlock for our customers. And we’re just getting started!

## Hacker Spotlight • Ads Dawson

### Meet Ads Dawson
Security Engineer, AI Red Teamer, and Hacker

At Bugcrowd, we talk a lot about the societal misconception that hackers and security professionals are two separate groups when in reality, they are one and the same. Full-time security professionals often hack on the side.

There is no better example of this than Ads Dawson, who has been both a Bugcrowd customer and a hacker on the Bugcrowd Platform. Ads has achieved some amazing accomplishments in his career, including most recently contributing to the Bugcrowd VRT update on AI application vulnerabilities. Read on to learn more about Ads!

#### A Journey into Building and Breaking

Ads started in the security space with an apprenticeship at an MSP. He did not have an educational background in computer science. Nevertheless, from there, he progressed along the path toward networking and security, network pen testing, application security, and eventually LLM applications and AI security. Ultimately, he has a passion for dissecting concepts down to the essence, which is extremely relevant in hacking and the security space. “I figured that if I already know how to build, manage, and deploy hybrid cloud networks, why not learn how to break them?” Ads says.

Ads has been hacking for about six years, and he’s loving it so far. He’s a self-described “meticulous dude” who cites a dedication to curiosity in every aspect of his life to be a main driver of his hacking success. “I have always challenged and motivated myself to fully comprehend a solution or function at a very detailed level,” Ads shares.

> “This has kept me constantly driven to adapt, learn new concepts or technologies, and improve my skills.”

VIEW PROFILE

#### Ads is a self-described “networking nerd at heart,” although he applies a well-oriented full-stack approach to hacking. He is also heavily involved in AI red teaming, which is a particularly new space. He is extremely motivated to constantly improve his machine learning (ML) adversarial capabilities.

> “Another cool aspect of hacking that I love is developing and building tools or a script that helps me fix common hacking problems.”

> “It is really effective to spend time on enhancing your offensive arsenal for investing in the long run,” Ads says.

#### Advice for Security Teams

For teams hoping to get more out of their bug bounty programs, Ads shared valuable insights from the hacker perspective. It starts with fostering better relationships with the hacking community.

> “Challenge the hacker and always motivate them to dig deeper! If you are denying a submission, it’s important to elaborate why and always be open to the possibility of a decision change. Another thing that goes a long way is spending some time on a cadence to update your program with new features or even notifications about behavior changes,” Ads says.

He also recommends that teams put themselves in a hacker’s shoes. Ask yourself if your scope is clear and concise while providing a clear and valid reporting chain with achievable acceptance criteria. By reviewing your program details from a different lens, you can catch areas where you’re potentially pigeonholing your program.

To wrap up, we asked Ads what he wished security leaders understood about hackers. “Hackers spend a lot of time out of their personal lives working within reasonable disclosures and constraints to secure companies’ attack surfaces. Come to the table with a cooperative spirit and a willingness to achieve mutually fair reasoning,” Ads says. “Embrace the fact that every hacker has unique insights, perspectives, and capabilities to offer. Having a dedicated and motivated hacker finding holes in your ecosystem is incredibly valuable, especially compared to traditional methods of security testing in resource-constrained environments.”

> “Embrace the fact that every hacker has unique insights, perspectives, and capabilities to offer.”

#### Advice for Hackers

Ads has been on both sides of a bug bounty program. Therefore, his perspective is valuable for hackers looking to improve their skills and earn greater recognition. When it comes to advice for hackers who are engaging with security teams, Ads suggests a well-rounded approach.

> “Consider every angle, leave no stone unturned, and always parse information thoroughly. It’s always incredibly easy to skim information, especially when you’re running on fumes. Prioritize yourself when you’re feeling burnt out—taking a walk or going to the gym does magic for your productivity. Lastly, don’t become hard-set on your favorite toolset or setup—always take the opportunity to step outside of your comfort zone,” Ads advises.

Ads also views stepping outside their comfort zones as a great way for hackers to earn more invites to hack on private programs. By involving themselves in the community and ongoing CTF events, hackers can increase their visibility. One way Ads does this is through his involvement in an OWASP chapter, which keeps him in the loop and regularly allows him to challenge himself.

Ads also suggests that hackers document their work (such as writeups) as a great way to show off their experience.

## The Heart of Hacking

Hackers are driven by a mix of personal and altruistic motivations that go far beyond the stereotype of the lone coder seeking a payday. Earning money is certainly a benefit, but hackers love making a difference in the digital world, protecting both individuals and organizations from threats.

The rush of outsmarting cybercriminals? Exhilarating. The satisfaction that comes with strengthening digital defenses? Unmatched. And the real magic happens when individual triumphs become collective victories. In this world, every bug squashed and every vulnerability patched is a win for the entire community.

So while the challenging puzzles and cutting-edge tech are cool, the best part about being a hacker is the opportunity to make the digital world a safer place while getting to do so alongside an awesome community. It's a reminder that in the world of cybersecurity, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts—and that's what makes hacking so cool.

### More Than Just a Paycheck

#### Why do you hack?

While hackers still consider making money important, they are increasingly being driven by other factors.

*   For reasons I'd rather not share: **3%**
*   For something to do: **4%**
*   For my livelihood: **8%**
*   For the greater good: **11%**
*   For my personal development: **28%**
*   For financial gain: **18%**
*   For the excitement: **15%**
*   For the challenge: **14%**

Hacking isn't just about the money. It's about personal and professional fulfillment.

### Unleash the Hacker

#### Top Hacking Roadblocks

*   Not enough private program invites: **45%**
*   Not enough scope: **26%**
*   Not enough programs that match my interest: **25%**
*   Not having the physical technology needed: **20%**
*   Unresponsive program owners or brands: **19%**
*   Inadequate incentives: **11%**
*   No safe harbor: **6%**
*   None of the above: **15%**
*   Other: **13%**

**87%** of hackers agree: Point-in-time security testing isn't enough. Companies need ongoing, continuous security measures to stay protected in today's dynamic digital world.

The hacker community is full of untapped potential waiting to be unleashed. While hackers are eager to dive deeper into their work, they are held back by narrow scopes, mismatched interests, and a lack of required technology. Limited access to private programs stands out as the top frustration among hackers, with almost half citing a desire for more opportunities. While hackers can continue to build their reputations, companies have the chance to expand their programs or explore new approaches. The message is clear: Give hackers the room to roam, the tools to tinker, and the challenges to conquer, and watch as they transform the cybersecurity world.

**Level up!** **91%** of hackers say they are now armed with more powerful tools than before.

#### The Disclosure Dilemma

Have you avoided disclosing a vulnerability because a company lacked a clear pathway for you to report it without risking legal consequences?

*   Yes: **52%**
*   No: **48%**

The legal aspect of vulnerability disclosure represents another challenge for hackers. More than half of hackers have held back on reporting disclosures due to unclear reporting pathways. Without a safe harbor, hackers tread a fine line between well-intentioned probes and unauthorized access, turning their exploration into legal trouble.

There’s certainly a path forward. Organizations can potentially double their influx of valuable security information if they can implement clear, hacker-friendly policies.

**73%** of hackers observed more vulnerabilities than last year. It's dangerous out there!

### Top Four Reasons to Be a Hacker

1.  To reduce risk of breach and reputation damage for companies
2.  To earn money
3.  To make the internet safer for consumers
4.  To build relationships and network with the security community

The tides are changing! **89%** of hackers believe companies appreciate hackers more than ever before. **58%** hack to reduce breach risks for companies. Hackers: The unsung heroes of corporate security!

## Hacker Spotlight • Specters

### Meet Specters
From Experiencing Homelessness to Being a Hardware Hacking Specialist

Meet Neiko—also known as Specters—a skateboarder by day, a punk music enthusiast by night, a full-time skilled hacker in between, and a truly selfless individual who prioritizes giving back to his community on top of it all.

Born in Chicago, Specters stumbled upon hacking during a tumultuous time in his life—when he found himself homeless and searching for a way out.

#### Hacking to Change Your Life

Specters was experiencing homelessness when he started hacking. “I figured hacking would be good to learn because it seemed like ‘computer people’ made some money,” Specters says.

He was first inspired by old-school phreaks like Mark Abene. He got started in car hacking and malware analysis.

As he journeyed into the hacking world, Specters had to learn that not all bugs have an impact. He would remind himself of the importance of stepping back when he didn’t get the result he wanted.

> “Bugcrowd truly gave me a shot to prove myself. I had zero credentials or achievements when I started.”

> I was homeless, I had just started car hacking, I was literally a nobody. Bugcrowd gave me a chance to change that.

VIEW PROFILE

#### Getting Started with Hardware Hacking

Specters started with car hacking, but he also loved malware analysis. Now, he is passionate about everything related to hardware hacking.

> “Hardware hacking is experiencing a huge resurgence right now. To be honest, I think it’s kind of due. There are a ton of embedded devices that are not secure, and a lot of people are realizing that again,” Specters says.

For hackers looking to get into hardware hacking, Specters recommends starting with different Arduino kits. These will help aspiring hackers learn many aspects of hardware hacking. Specters personally bought an IoT clock Arduino kit that had many different protocols and circuits that he had to set up, which he recommends as well. He advises aspiring hackers to analyze hardware using different tools and to seek out resources from the security community to get started.

Finally, whether you’re passionate about hardware or other specializations, Specters’ advice for new hackers is, “hack for fun, not for profit.”

#### Paying It Forward

Specters is extremely passionate about paying his success forward and expanding diversity in the hacking community. “I think something that bothers me is the lack of Hispanic representation in hacking,” Specters says.

Specters does presentations for Latinx groups, introducing them to computers and hacking. He also mentors people who are seeking guidance, providing them with instruction and materials to get them started.

He recommends supporting Hack the Hood and Boards 4 Bros, which are two organizations that are very personal to him.

> “Their efforts go toward neighborhoods like the one I grew up in, and they help kids like me.”

> “Identity has always been a difficult issue for me. I am talking to so many different communities now and so many people who had similar experiences, and just making friends has really helped me, so I want to pay that forward.”

## Hardware Hacking

Hardware hacking was once considered a niche pursuit. Today, it’s experiencing a dramatic acceleration.

Given the increase in cheaply made and often unnecessarily complex smart devices on the market and the advancements in tools for hacking, the conditions are ripe for hardware hacking. Unfortunately, this also means that the conditions are perfect for threat actors who target hardware, threatening consumers, companies, and governments.

There's a tendency to oversimplify hardware hacking—people assume that physical access makes hacking easy or, conversely, that remote attacks are impossible. Hardware hacking is far more complex than both these scenarios, and these misconceptions are harmful because threat actors will exploit every hardware vulnerability they can find.

### The Rise of Hardware Hacking

#### Hardware Hacking 101

At its core, hardware hacking exploits vulnerabilities in the physical components of electronic devices rather than just in their software. It involves the unauthorized manipulation or modification of a device's hardware to bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access, or alter a device’s intended functionality. The goal of hardware hacking is often to circumvent protections, steal data, or gain control of a device in ways its designers didn’t intend. Software security, no matter how sophisticated, is practically useless if attackers find ways to exploit the physical hardware.

A number of common techniques are used to break into hardware. In side-channel attacks, for example, a threat actor observes a system and monitors it to catch unintentional information leakage, like power consumption or electromagnetic emissions, to recover cryptographic keys or other secret data. Firmware manipulation is a technique to change a device's core programming, opening doors to unauthorized access. Fault injection is a common hardware hacking technique that deliberately introduces errors into a device's operations. By causing precise, temporary malfunctions through means like voltage glitches or clock signal manipulation, threat actors can bypass security measures, skip important instructions, or gain access.

#### Democratization of Hacking Tools

Many believe that hardware hacking is a prohibitively expensive pursuit that requires specialized equipment or that it's too complex for anyone but advanced technical experts to engage in. These notions are becoming increasingly outdated, as tools are becoming more affordable and resources more accessible. Consider, for example, side-channel attacks. These are becoming increasingly common, as measuring equipment has become more precise and affordable. With these tools, hackers can now capture detailed operational data from live systems. While some extremely expensive tools can certainly make things easier, they're rarely necessary. Like with all forms of hacking, creativity and problem-solving go a long way.

Fault injection attacks are also on the rise, also in part because of the accessibility of low-cost gadgets. An impressive example of this is when security researcher Lennert Wouters hacked a Starlink satellite dish using a custom-built modchip costing just $25. By physically attaching this device to a stripped-down dish, they launched a fault injection attack that temporarily shorted the system. This anomaly allowed them to effectively bypass Starlink's security measures, granting access to previously locked areas of the system's software.

#### Not-So-Smart Devices

As our world becomes increasingly interconnected and as more smart devices are connected to the internet, security risks will multiply exponentially as a result. Devices connected to the internet are part of the large global network, and unfortunately, this means they are exposed to potential dangers. Today, the market is flooded with these "smart" devices, from “smart” microwaves to “smart” flip-flops, and many of these prioritize features over security, creating numerous entry points for cyberattacks. A smart device getting hacked can have immediate real-world impact.

For instance, a vulnerability in a smart oven could allow a threat actor to remotely activate the appliance, creating a significant safety risk. This scenario isn't hypothetical; a security flaw in LG's smart home app once made such a smart oven exploit possible.

Hardware security flaws are found beyond kitchen appliances, and the consequences of these vulnerabilities in other smart devices can be even more severe. The medical field is an industry where hardware hacks of smart devices can be extremely dangerous. In 2017, the FDA confirmed serious security flaws in St. Jude Medical's cardiac devices. It revealed that hackers could potentially manipulate pacemakers and defibrillators through their remote monitoring systems, not only compromising patient data but potentially endangering lives. For such industries, the stakes extend far beyond data protection to matters of life and death.

#### The Power of AI

AI is changing the security industry, and hardware is no exception. First, it’s making tools more powerful. AI significantly enhances the effectiveness of side-channel attacks. For example, AI algorithms can perform complex analyses, discovering minute variations in power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or timing data from a device. Additionally, they can identify behavioral patterns that humans might miss. Moreover, AI's ability to quickly process and adapt to complex patterns makes it particularly suited for tackling the intricate timing issues often associated with fault injection techniques. AI can help determine the correct frequency, timing, and intensity of induced faults.

AI can also extend the reach and speed at which a hacker accesses systems—the ability to automate and parallelize attacks enables simultaneous breaches across multiple devices. For instance, an AI can digitally analyze webcams and access vision data that would normally take one person hours to process. Using AI, a threat actor can tap multiple webcams and create reconnaissance targets and large, powerful intelligence networks. In the not-so-distant future, devices may be so interconnected that an AI could hack all sorts of devices with just an internet connection.

AI could also pose a threat to physical security. It could analyze vast amounts of data to create convincing fake identities, complete with realistic credentials and background information. These might create digital IDs or RFID badges, potentially granting access to restricted areas like server rooms or data centers. Once inside, an attacker could compromise systems or install backdoors, leading to data breaches, espionage, or service disruptions.

#### What Happens Next

Looking to the future of hardware security, we can expect several key developments as AI continues to evolve. AI-driven defense mechanisms will likely emerge, resulting in automated systems for detecting and responding to hardware vulnerabilities. We'll see an increased focus on securing the intersection of hardware and software, recognizing that vulnerabilities often lie in their integration.

While the threat of hardware hacks is significant, this is not a cause for panic but a call for action. The growing community of hardware security experts, now more open
