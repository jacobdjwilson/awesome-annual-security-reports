## INTRODUCTION

In the fall of 2023, WiCyS and N2K formalized a partnership designed to provide insights into the state of cybersecurity talent across the WiCyS organization.

The partnership between N2K Networks Inc. (N2K) and Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS) represents a significant step forward in boosting skills and fostering innovation in the cybersecurity industry. This strategic partnership combines N2K’s deep analytical expertise in cybersecurity workforce development alongside WiCyS’s expansive network within the cybersecurity community. Together, N2K and WiCyS conducted a comprehensive analysis of WiCyS members’ skills to spotlight strengths, identify skill gaps, and ultimately foster a robust and diverse cybersecurity workforce.

At the core of WiCyS is a compelling mission: to recruit, retain, and advance women in cybersecurity. Their vision is a world where the cybersecurity workforce is as inclusive as it is skilled, welcoming diverse talents and perspectives with open arms.

The primary goal of this collaboration was to conduct an in-depth analysis of WiCyS members’ cybersecurity skills. This initiative was designed to uncover critical insights into WiCyS members’ capabilities through diagnostic assessments and enriched by demographic data. The study explores the nuances of skill sets across various roles, pinpoints areas for development, and generates significant findings that will inform strategic enhancements in training and professional growth.

### THE PARTICIPANTS

WiCyS members participating in the study represent a full range of cyber work roles and experience levels. In total, 399 members participated in the study. Because some survey data was optional for participants, 41.8% of participants did not indicate their experience level, and 27.8% opted not to indicate which functional area of cybersecurity they represented.

**Total Participants:** 399

**Experience Levels:**
*   Junior: 118
*   Mid: 54
*   Senior: 36
*   Manager: 24

### OUR APPROACH

The approach adopted for this study involved voluntary participants from WiCyS’s diverse member base and following them through N2K’s NICE Workforce Diagnostic, which is designed to rigorously evaluate participant knowledge and skills across various specialty areas and competency areas identified in the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. This methodical approach ensured comprehensive and precise data collection, providing a clear snapshot of the member’s current capabilities and potential areas for improvement.

N2K’s NICE Workforce Diagnostic is designed to measure performance against TKS (task, knowledge, and skill) statements and competencies for a variety of defined cybersecurity work roles. This method of diagnosing a workforce, along with innovative data visualizations and dashboards to analyze and compare performance data, allows N2K to identify potential strengths and gaps across a cybersecurity and cyber-enabled workforce.

**Process:**
1.  Call for participation across WiCyS member base. Over 700 WiCyS members “raised their hand as willing participants.”
2.  N2K provisioned WiCyS participants access to N2K’s NICE Workforce Diagnostic. Of the volunteers, 399 WiCyS members completed the diagnostic. Participating members were also given access to N2K’s Critical Knowledge Course as a thank you for completing the diagnostic.
3.  N2K analyzed the results of the diagnostic, using Experience Levels and N2K’s Functional Groupings as key components to interpret results. Because N2K’s NICE Workforce Diagnostic tests participants’ knowledge and skills across the broad spectrum of the NICE Framework, it’s important to analyze the results through the lens of the functions of their work roles and experience. As a result, N2K can interpret results by Experience Levels, N2K’s Functional Grouping, and NICE Specialty Areas (and combinations thereof).

**Analyzing & Interpreting Results:**

The findings from this talent study revealed significant strengths among WiCyS members, who consistently demonstrated exceptional proficiency across most of the NICE Framework. Their performances in the NICE Specialty Areas: Legal Advice and Advocacy, Executive Cyber Leadership, Cybersecurity Management, Cyber Operational Planning, Strategic Planning, and Policy were particularly noteworthy.

These areas showcased the depth of their cybersecurity knowledge and also highlighted their potential to lead and innovate within the industry. The data also show specific opportunities for further opportunities, guiding WiCyS in refining its training and development programs to better support its members’ professional growth and ensure their skills remain at the forefront of industry standards.

### About the NIST-NICE Cyber Workforce Framework:

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cyber Workforce Framework, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), plays a crucial role in addressing cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development needs. By providing a standardized taxonomy and common lexicon, the NIST-NICE Cyber Workforce Framework enables organizations to define and understand the essential tasks, knowledge, and skill (TKS) statements required for cybersecurity roles. This framework not only aids in the development and training of cybersecurity professionals but also helps in workforce planning and management. Additionally, the NICE Framework establishes a taxonomy and common lexicon that describes cyber security work and workers irrespective of where or for whom the work is performed.

On March 5th, 2024, NIST unveiled the latest update to this essential framework: version 1.0.0 of the NIST-NICE Cyber Workforce Framework. This release marks a significant milestone, as it incorporates several updates aimed at refining and enhancing the framework to better align with the current and future needs of the cybersecurity workforce. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, so too must the strategies and frameworks that underpin the development of those who support cyber missions and work.

It’s important to note that this Talent Inventory Study was launched prior to the March 2024 update to the NICE Framework (version 1.0.0), and therefore analyze performance results to the 2017 version of the NICE Framework, particularly to the NICE Categories and Specialty Areas as defined in that version of the Framework.

### About the N2K’s Functional Groups & Taxonomy:

To address industry challenges in translating various elements of the NICE Framework into common job titles and functional teams used for cyber professionals across the commercial sector, N2K established and defined 14 Functional Groups*. These groups serve as a translation taxonomy, or a “Rosetta Stone.” Utilizing N2K’s Functional Groups offers a streamlined way to analyze performance and interpret workforce needs, reflecting common cybersecurity team structures.

Moreover, N2K has mapped elements of the NICE Framework—such as NICE Work Roles, Specialty Areas, and Competency Areas—as well as common certifications and training programs to these Functional Groups. This mapping provides a more comprehensive picture of the cyber workforce and training ecosystem. It enables N2K to analyze and compare datasets in several unique ways, offering deeper insights into workforce dynamics and training needs.
