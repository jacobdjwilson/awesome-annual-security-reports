Introduction

This Flexera 2024 Software Vulnerability & Threat Intelligence Report is based upon data from the
Flexera Secunia Research Team who produces valuable advisories leveraged by users of Flexera’s
Software Vulnerability Research and Software Vulnerability Manager solutions.

The report analyzes the evolution of software security from a vulnerability, threat intelligence and
patch perspective.

The report presents global data on the prevalence of vulnerabilities, exploits, the availability of
patches and maps the security threats to IT infrastructures.

What does the report cover?

The annual Vulnerability Review is based on data from Flexera's Secunia Research. Secunia Research
monitors more than 71,000 applications, appliances and operating systems, and tests and verifies
the vulnerabilities reported in them.

The systems and applications monitored by Secunia Research are in use in the environments of the
customers of Flexera Software Vulnerability Management solutions.

The vulnerability database covers vulnerabilities that can be exploited in all types of products,
including software, hardware and firmware.

The vulnerabilities verified by Secunia Research are described in Secunia Advisories and listed in
the Flexera Vulnerability Database, detailing what IT security teams need to know to mitigate the
vulnerability risk posed in their environments. The Secunia Advisory descriptions include criticality,
attack vector, exploitability and solution status.

How do we count vulnerabilities?

Research houses in the vulnerability management space adopt different approaches to counting
vulnerabilities.

Secunia Research counts vulnerabilities per product in which the vulnerability appears. We apply this
method to reflect the level of information our customers need to keep their environments secure.

We provide verified intelligence listing all products affected by a given vulnerability.

Secunia Research software vulnerability tracking process

A vulnerability is an error in software which can be exploited with a security impact and gain.
Secunia Research validates, verifies and tests vulnerability information to author security advisories
which provide valuable details by following consistent and standard processes that have been
refined over the years.

Whenever a new vulnerability is reported, it’s verified and a Secunia Advisory is published. A Secunia
Advisory provides details including description of the vulnerability, risk rating, impact, attack vector,
recommended mitigation, credits, references and more, and additional details discovered during
verification and testing, thus providing the information required to make appropriate decisions
about how to protect systems.

Click here to learn more about Secunia Advisories and their contents.

The anatomy of a security advisory

A security advisory is a summary of the work that Secunia Research performs to communicate standardized,
validated and enriched vulnerability research on a specific software product version.

We issue Secunia Research criticality ratings and common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) metrics after a
distinct analysis in the advisories. This dual rating method allows for a much-improved means of prioritizing by
criticality—delivering a review that includes product context and related security best practices.

A rejection advisory issued by the research team  means we’ve determined it’s not worthy of your attention.
This advisory comes if a vendor issues an advisory acknowledging vulnerability that we don’t believe to be
valid—and would have a product solution we aren’t recommending or exceeding already. We send that out to
save you considerable time.

If someone other than the vendor issues an advisory that we don’t believe to be valid, we discard it. We take
that action so you don’t waste your time processing inconsequential vulnerability information. Check out this
infographic.

2024 summary

Total advisories: 12,318 ↑ (2023: 7,097)

2024 is another record year for highest number of advisories issued by the Secunia Research team.
This was  a busy year for cybersecurity, not only a record-breaking number of advisories and
vulnerabilities were reported, but also many significant vulnerabilities were the cause of data
breaches, ransomware attacks and other types of threats that impacted many organizations
worldwide.

Interesting facts and trends

•  2024 is the year with the most recorded Secunia Advisories since 2002

•  NVD published over 40,000 CVEs in 2024, an increase of almost 39% compared to 2023

(28,817 CVEs)

•  Average threat score went down: ↓ 12.19 (2023: 15.68) (click here to learn how we calculate this)

•  Average CVSS3 score just slightly lower: ↓ 7.04 (2023: 7.28)

•

Less extreme critical advisories have been reported in 2024: 50 (2023: 74)

•  83 advisories reported a zero-day vulnerability (2023: 130)

•  More than 50% of all advisories are Unix/Linux operating systems vulnerabilities

•  More than 80% of all rejected advisories are also Unix/Linux operating systems related

•

Little over 58% of all networking-related advisories are for Cisco, F5 and Juniper

•  About Microsoft:

•  2.91% of all advisories were for Microsoft, which put them  9th (2023: 8th place)

in vendor ranking.

o  56.63% ↓ (2023: 57.6 percent) of all zero-days were related to Microsoft products

(first place).

•  None of the top four vendors with the most advisories (Red Hat, SUSE, Linux Foundation,

Oracle) had any zero-days reported in 2024

Software vulnerability mitigation and ratch management are becoming increasingly important. Due
to the use of AI and the ongoing conflicts in the world, attacks on critical infrastructures in many
countries are increasing. Back in 2019 (just before COVID), patching was recommended within 30
days (or 14 days for CVSS score of seven or higher). Today, hackers can deploy exploits within one
week and even within 24 hours. This means organizations need even better prioritization to quickly
patch vulnerabilities (especially those with associated threats).

The growing challenges with NVD in 2024

An average of 150 CVEs are disclosed per business day. As global tensions escalate and AI empowers
malicious actors to craft and deploy exploits within minutes, timely and accurate vulnerability
intelligence is more critical than ever.

For years, many organizations have leaned on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) as a key
resource for vulnerability management. However, recent developments have exposed significant
limitations within the NVD, pushing businesses to seek out more reliable and effective alternatives.

The decline of NVD: A data-driven crisis

In 2024 the backlog within the NVD
grew drastically, casting doubt on its
ability to keep pace with the demands
of modern cybersecurity.

Persistent API performance issues,
including recent outages, have rendered
automated data retrieval and
integrations unreliable. This further
complicates vulnerability management
workflows for organizations dependent
on the NVD.

The human and business costs of NVD challenges

For organizations relying on the NVD, these delays and inaccuracies translate into significant risks.

Extended risk windows: The lag in vulnerability analysis prolongs the time it takes to detect,
prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities. With some exploits weaponized in as little as 1-7 days after
disclosure, the risk window is dangerously wide.

Resource strain: Security teams often resort to manual research and cross-referencing, sapping
valuable resources that could otherwise be directed toward proactive measures.

Compliance challenges: Delayed and incomplete data impacts an organization's ability to meet
regulatory requirements, such as NIS2, DORA, ISO, CRA or other industry-specific mandates.

Rethinking vulnerability intelligence: Why free isn’t always reliable

The NVD, a free database managed by the U.S. government, has long been a go-to resource for
organizations. However, its unverified, unanalyzed, and often incomplete data poses significant risks
to effective cybersecurity. Flexera’s Software Vulnerability Research provides a trusted alternative,
offering thoroughly researched, validated, and enriched data. Since 2002, the research has provided
reliable vulnerability intelligence without disruptions, ensuring organizations can depend on
accurate and actionable insights to stay secure.

Advisories versus CVEs and vice versa

Secunia Research focuses on delivering verified, tested and enriched vulnerability information per
product or product group. This can result in CVEs being reported for many advisories and vice versa.

included in the below statistics.)

This means that many products are affected by these CVEs.

Below is a great example of a CVE and different results for CVSS scoring, which confirms that CVSS scoring
should not be your only variable to assign urgency or priority.

Filling the gaps – vulnerability ratings and product context

Especially with the perceived absence of NVD, the availability of vulnerability ratings at no cost
largely depends on the vendors respective maintainers of products.

We witnessed first-hand what happens if one of the dominant maintainer’s won’t provide an
exploitability analysis or a CVSS score.

The Linux Foundation CNA (CVE numbering authority) bases its CVE assignments for the Linux Kernel
and the resulting security advisories largely on the impact of a potential vulnerability. However, as
every vulnerability analyst knows, exploitability matters. Is there a vector to exploit a potential
vulnerability with a gain for the potential attacker?

As a result of the lack of quality of such vulnerability reports, vendors of products using the Linux
Kernel scramble to derive their own vulnerability ratings. Take CVE-2024-26923 for example:

NVD
SUSE

* Information as of January 27, 2025

The analysis of Secunia Research derives a CVSS score on a per product basis for any valid
vulnerabilities. Any crucial missing information from vendor reporting will be derived from the
information available.

In this case, the CVE is related to a dangling pointer and requiring a difficult to exploit race condition
involving the garbage collection (GC), which makes it less likely to be able to exploit this vulnerability
for a full-fledged privilege escalation. Thus, in the base Linux Kernel itself we rated the vulnerability
with an unknown impact coming from an attacker who is a local user on the operating system
(CVSS:3.1 Base Score 4.9 / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).

Nevertheless, the situation for SUSE, Red Hat, etc. may differ e.g., due to how their own kernel is
configured and compiled and which parts of the original Linux Kernel code base is used.

Therefore, Secunia Research has the capabilities to rate the very same vulnerability differently
depending on the actual product exposing the vulnerability. The product context matters! The CVSS
scores provided by each vendor are considered as a data point for the respective Secunia Advisories
related to the vendor.

More information about the variables used in the above charts:

•  Attack vector (from where)

•  Criticality (severity)

Though not shown in the chart, Secunia Research also provides information about the impact or
consequence when a vulnerability has been exploited. There are 12 values that can
be used (most advisories have one or more). Read more here.

Advisories and impact (Consequence of exploited)

Impact (Consequence)
The following are Consequence values.

Brute Force
Used in cases where an application or an algorithm allows an
attacker to guess passwords in an easy manner.

Cross-Site Scripting
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities allow a third party to
manipulate the content or behavior of a web application in a
user's browser, without compromising the underlying system.
Different Cross-Site Scripting related vulnerabilities are also
classified under this category, including “script insertion” and
“cross-site request forgery”.
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities are often used against specific
users of a website to steal their credentials or to conduct spoofing
attacks.

DoS (Denial of Service)
This includes vulnerabilities ranging from excessive resource
consumption (for example, causing a system to use a lot of
memory) to crashing an application or an entire system.

Exposure of Sensitive Information
Vulnerabilities where documents or credentials are leaked or can
be revealed either locally or remotely.

Exposure of System Information
Vulnerabilities where excessive information about the system (for
example. version numbers, running services, installation paths,
and similar) are exposed and can be revealed from remote and, in
some cases, locally.

Hijacking
Covers vulnerabilities where a user session or a communication
channel can be taken over by other users or remote attackers.

Manipulation of Data
This includes vulnerabilities where a user or a remote attacker
can manipulate local data on a system, but not necessarily be able
to gain escalated privileges or system access.
The most frequent type of vulnerabilities with this impact are
SQL-injection vulnerabilities, where a malicious user or person
can manipulate SQL queries.

Privilege Escalation
Covers vulnerabilities where a user can conduct certain tasks with
the privileges of other users or administrative users.
This typically includes cases where a local user on a client or
server system can gain access to the administrator or root
account, thus taking full control of the system.

Security Bypass
Covers vulnerabilities or security issues where malicious users or
people can bypass certain security mechanisms of the application.
The actual impact varies significantly depending on the design
and purpose of the affected application.

Spoofing
Covers various vulnerabilities where it is possible for malicious
users or people to impersonate other users or systems.

System Access
Covers vulnerabilities where malicious people are able to gain
system access and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a
local user.

Unknown
Covers various weaknesses, security issues, and vulnerabilities not
covered by the other impact types, or where the impact is not
known due to insufficient information from vendors and
researchers.

14

Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on the
potential consequence is a crucial aspect of
effective cybersecurity management.
The use of a scoring mechanism allows
organizations to systematically assess and
prioritize vulnerabilities, ensuring that
the most critical issues are addressed first.

Below is an example of a scoring table that
can be used in a prioritization process.

Rejection advisories

There are many vulnerabilities posted in the NVD, by many vendors and CNA’s. They are not always
valid and they are not always assigned proper criticality ratings. In some cases, a vulnerability may
be legitimate but does not provide the attacker any benefit.

The Flexera Secunia Research team evaluates vulnerabilities from hundreds of sources, rescores
them when necessary and even rejects vulnerabilities not worth your attention. Rejection advisories
help you reduce the volume of vulnerabilities to be mitigated by helping you focus only on those
that present reasonable risk to your environment.

For example, NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corporation), may require reporting not only
the vulnerabilities covered by the normal advisories but also vulnerabilities,
which our Research Team has rejected as not being a valid threat to security.

On average, 15 percent of the total number of advisories are rejection
advisories. In 2024, there were 23.35% (2,877 rejection advisories).
This is mostly due to the high volume of rejections from Linux Foundation.

Linux Foundation was responsible for a total of 2,600 advisories in 2024, of which more than half
(1,360) were given the rejection tag by the Secunia Research Team.

Top Vendors with most rejection advisories

The Linux Foundation has not only disclosed the most vulnerabilities this year, but most of these
vulnerabilities were given a rejection reason by the Secunia Research Team.

An advisory may be rejected for many reasons; the most common are:

•  No reachability

The vulnerability cannot be exploited because the affected systems cannot be reached
by an attacker.

•  No gain

The vulnerability may be reached, but without any gain for the attacker.

•  No exploitability

The vulnerability cannot be exploited because, for example, policy forbids installation
of the affected software.

•  Dependent on other

The vulnerability cannot be exploited by itself but depends on another vulnerability
being present.

Addressing awareness with vulnerability insights

Prevalence

•  How many systems would benefit from any given security update?
•  Does it pose a risk? Is it on all systems? Patch.

Asset sensitivity

•  What systems would result in the most risk if compromised?
•

Is it a high-risk device? Patch.

Criticality

•  The most popular method of thoughtful prioritization.
•
If exploited, how bad could it affect your security?
•
Is it designated to be of a high criticality? Patch.

 Threat intelligence

•  The newest and most impactful method focuses on the likelihood of exploitation.
•

Is it likely to be exploited? Patch.

©2025 Flexera

17

How do we know  more insights/data is needed?

Focusing on advisories with CVSS 7 or higher would address about 50 percent of exploits. Most exploits are
CVSS scored between four and seven. Focusing on vulnerabilities for the top 20 vendors would address only
about 20 percent.

Browser-related advisories

Web browsers serve as our gateway to the internet, providing a seamless interface for accessing
information, services and entertainment. However, this very connectivity exposes browsers to an
array of vulnerabilities, in most cases exploited through a remote attack vector.

The urgency of timely browser patching cannot be overstated. As users traverse the digital
landscape, the constant evolution of security mechanisms by browser developers remains a critical
line of defense. Failing to patch vulnerabilities in a timely manner increases the likelihood of falling
victim to remote exploits, exposing users to a range of potential risks.

Threat intelligence

In a world where there are now more than 40,000 new vulnerabilities (CVEs) every year, being smart about
prioritizing remediation efforts is essential. Leveraging threat intelligence is another valuable layer of insight
that helps you understand which of the vulnerabilities affecting your environment are being exploited in the
wild.

Leveraging machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human curation from thousands of sources in the
open, deep and dark web, threat intelligence augments Flexera’s Software Vulnerability Research’s
vulnerability intelligence with a threat score that provides the ultimate prioritization tool for your busy
desktop operations teams.

Patching

Most of 2024’s vulnerabilities were vendor patched. In fact, most vulnerabilities are patched within
24 hours after disclosure.

The challenge remains that organizations don’t have full visibility or awareness when a vulnerability
is disclosed (time to awareness). Another big challenge is time to remediation (the time from having
this information, correlating that with your environment and initiating the process to get the
software updated to a secure version).

Recent data about MTTR (Mean Time to Remediation)

192 Days is an industry average based on recent studies

271 Days for organizations using standard practices without dedicated vulnerability
management solutions

135 Days for organizations with robust processes for critical vulnerabilities

Sector specific trends

o  Finance/Banking: Tends to have faster MTTRs (under 100 days for critical

vulnerabilities) due to regulatory pressures and proactive security measures

o  Healthcare: Slower MTTRs (often exceeding 200 days) due to legacy systems and

resource constraints

o  Technology/IT: Typically, closer to 100 days due to better integration of automated

patching systems
