# 2024 Vulnerability Statistics Report
## 9th Edition

We split our statistical models across layers of the technology stack (Full Stack) such as Web Application, API, and Device/Host layers.

Additionally, we make a distinction in the data, highlighting if discovered CVE’s have associated exploit code freely available.

Unfortunately, we still see high rates of known (patchable) exploitable vulnerabilities, with working exploits in the wild being used by nation states and cyber criminal groups against organizations who are slow to patch.

Since Edgescan employs a number of risk prioritization scoring mechanisms, we take a deeper look at the most common risks faced by organizations and also look at correlation of the various risk scoring methodologies.

Some of the results are surprising and we hope you will stay to the end to learn more!

Given Edgescan maps validated vulnerabilities automatically to CVSS¹, CISA KEV², EPSS³ and our own EVSS (Edgescan Validated Security Score), we have leveraged this information to provide a qualitatively better guide to what the most common risks are, as faced by systems deployed in modern enterprises.

## Introduction & Synopsis

Welcome to the 9th edition of the Edgescan Vulnerability Stats Report 2024.

This report demonstrates the state of full stack security based on thousands of security assessments and penetration tests on millions of assets that were performed globally from the Edgescan Cybersecurity Platform in 2023.

This is an analysis of vulnerabilities detected in the systems of hundreds of organizations across a wide range of industries – from the Fortune 500 to medium and small businesses.

The report provides a statistical model of the most common weaknesses faced by organizations to enable data-driven decisions for managing risks and exposures more effectively.

We hope this report will provide a unique by-the-numbers insight into trends, statistics and a snapshot of the overall state of cybersecurity for the past year, from the perspective of vulnerabilities discovered and remediated, as well as penetration testing success rates.

We are proud that this yearly report has become a reliable source for approximating the global state of vulnerability management. This is exemplified by our unique dataset being part of the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), which is the de facto standard for insights into the common drivers for incidents and breaches today.

This year we delve into Risk Density to describe where critical severity vulnerabilities and exposures are clustered in the IT technical stack, quantification of attack surface management exposures and risks, and Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR) critical vulnerabilities.

## Welcome

When we examine cyber posture from an attack surface standpoint, exposed services are a real risk.

Statistically some vulnerabilities have a very low frequency of occurrence compared to the total number of vulnerabilities discovered, but many will result in a breach with an outsized impact, which we can call an intensive rather than extensive risk.

Similarly to the 2023 report, patching and maintenance is a challenge and we still find that it is not trivial to patch production systems.

The MTTR (Mean Time to Remediation) stats also reflect on this issue. Continuous detection and assessment needs improvement and as I’ve always said, visibility is paramount.

Internal, non-public cyber security posture is significantly lacking in terms of resilience and ease of exploit. Combining vulnerabilities across the stack, in some cases, results in the potential impact being much more severe than the sum of the individual discovered vulnerabilities.

Attack Surface Management (Visibility) is a key driver to cybersecurity best practices and based on our continuous asset profiling, we discuss how common sensitive and critical systems are exposed to the public Internet far more than they should be.

The assumption here is that enterprises simply do not have systems, people and processes in place, to make them aware of exposures in a manner that facilitates remediation actions.

This report provides a global snapshot across dozens of industry verticals and how to prioritize what is important, as not all vulnerabilities are created equal.

Best regards,

Oddly, CVE’s dating from 2015 are still being discovered and are being used by ransomware and malware toolkits to exploit systems when they can find them.

## Vulnerability Severity EPSS, CISA KEV & EVSS

### What is EPSS?

The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is an open, data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. The EPSS model produces a probability score between 0 and 1 (0 and 100%). The higher the score, the greater the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited.

[https://www.first.org/epss/](https://www.first.org/epss/)

### What is CISA KEV?

CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild: the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog. CISA strongly recommends all organizations review and monitor the KEV catalog and prioritize remediation of the listed vulnerabilities to reduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.

[https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities)

### Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS)

Every vulnerability discovered by Edgescan is validated via a combination of advanced “big-data” analytics and human expertise, resulting in near false positive-free vulnerability intelligence. Once a vulnerability is validated it is mapped to both the CISA KEV and EPSS to assist with prioritization. All vulnerabilities in Edgescan (where applicable) have a EPSS, CISA KEV, CVSS and EVSS risk score.

[https://www.edgescan.com/solutions/risk-based-vulnerability-management-rbvm/](https://www.edgescan.com/solutions/risk-based-vulnerability-management-rbvm/)

### Edgescan eXposure Factor (EXF)

The edgescan Exposure factor combines EPSS, CVSS, CISA KEV and EVSS to reach a simple priority score which taken in relevance with other vulnerabilities provides a simple way to prioritize discovered and validated vulnerabilities.

## Risk Density

The following is a breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity, discovered across the full stack; Web Applications, API’s and Network/Host deployments.

It also depicts the risks associated with potential PCI (Payment Card Industry) Failures – not every vulnerability results in a PCI fail. Severity is defined via the Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS). Later in the report we draw upon CVSS, CISA KEV and EPSS Risk and Probability scores.

Severity is based on Edgescan EVSS (Edgescan Validated Vulnerability Score). EVSS is applied to Web application vulnerabilities and is based upon likelihood & impact when a vulnerability is undergoing validation.

### Severity Dispersion Across the Full Stack (Network, Web, API combined)

*   CRITICAL: 9%
*   HIGH: 24%
*   MEDIUM: 43%
*   LOW: 8%
*   INFO: 16%

**ACROSS THE FULL STACK MORE THAN 33% OF DISCOVERED VULNERABILITIES WERE OF A CRITICAL OR HIGH SEVERITY**

**SEVERITY IS BASED ON EDGESCAN EVSS (EDGESCAN VALIDATED VULNERABILITY SCORE)**

**EVSS IS APPLIED TO WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITIES AND IS BASED UPON LIKELIHOOD & IMPACT WHEN A VULNERABILITY IS UNDERGOING VALIDATION**

### Web Application & API Vulnerability Dispersion by Severity

*   CRITICAL: 6%
*   HIGH: 6.8%
*   MEDIUM: 27.6%
*   LOW: 59.6%

**ACROSS THE WEB APPLICATION AND API LAYERS 12.8% OF DISCOVERED VULNERABILITIES WERE OF A CRITICAL OR HIGH SEVERITY**

**AS DEPICTED LATER IN THIS DOCUMENT CRITICAL AND HIGH SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES REMAIN VERY SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS YEARS**

**VULNERABILITIES SUCH AS SQL INJECTION (CWE-89) ARE READILY DISCOVERED AND ACCOUNT FOR 19.47% OF ALL CRITICAL AND HIGH SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES**

### Network/Host Vulnerability Dispersion by Severity

*   CRITICAL: 9.1%
*   HIGH: 25.3%
*   MEDIUM: 43.1%
*   LOW: 22.5%

**34.4% OF DISCOVERED VULNERABILITIES IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE/HOSTING/CLOUD/NETWORK LAYER WERE OF A CRITICAL OR HIGH SEVERITY**

**19% HAD AN EPSS SCORE ABOVE 0.8 (PROBABILITY OF BREACH EXCEEDING 80%)**

### Breach Probability Dispersion

*   EPSS > 0.8 (>80%): 19%
*   EPSS 0.6 - 0.79 (60%-79%): 1%
*   EPSS 0.1-0.59 (10% - 59%): 17%
*   EPSS below < 0.1 (10%): 63%

## PCI Failures Per Severity

### PCI Failures Per Severity

*   CRITICAL: 9%
*   HIGH: 23%
*   MEDIUM: 67%
*   LOW: 2%

**32% OF PCI FAILURES WERE OF HIGH & CRITICAL SEVERITY**

### Highest EPSS

*   **CVE-2020-1938**: 97%
*   **CVE-2014-0224**: 97%
*   **CVE-2023-42795, CVE-2023-44487, CVE-2023-45648**: 60%
*   **CVE-2014-3566**: 98%

### PCI Failures with an EPSS Score <10%

AN EPSS SCORE BELOW 0.10 DEPICTS THE PROBABILITY OF BREACH VIA SUCH A VULNERABILITY IS LESS THAN 10%
