The implications are clear.

Welcome to Howden’s fourth annual report on the cyber insurance market. The themes for this year’s edition are risk, resilience and relevance.

At no other point has the market experienced the current mix of conditions: a heightened threat landscape combined with a stable insurance market underpinned by robust risk controls.

The implications are clear. Current conditions offer an opportunity for buyers to secure protection at favourable terms. For insurers, the opportunity is to lean into a class with clear potential for steady exposure-led growth, ongoing profitability and innovation.

## Executive summary

### Risk and resilience

Ransomware continues to stalk the threat landscape as the costliest form of cyber attack. The past 12 months have seen the splintering of ransomware groups, increased collaboration between hackers and tacit support from hostile governments. These trends have sustained the heightened threat, with data from NCC Group showing attacks increasing by 85% last year relative to 2022 (when activity dipped due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) and by 30% from 1Q23 to 1Q24.

Data presents a more nuanced picture on the severity front. Recovery costs from ransomware are once again increasing after a temporary decline in 2022. In addition, multiple high-profile attacks have recently struck the healthcare sector, causing widespread disruption and major economic losses. Investments in cyber security and insurance coverage are paying dividends in this environment, with insured companies now less vulnerable to prolonged disruption in the event of an attack. This is reflected by a marked fall in the proportion of victims compelled to pay a ransom over the last year.

Staying one step ahead of attackers not only makes organisations more resilient to financially motivated cyber attacks, but it also means that they are better prepared to navigate any larger scale incidents. The recent MOVEit, Change Healthcare and NHS hacks have demonstrated how attacks on a single point of failure (SPoF) can radiate across the targeted organisation’s customer base or IT network, ultimately affecting thousands of indirect victims. Insured losses are nevertheless expected to be manageable and these events provide valuable lessons around the potential for loss aggregation in any future attack(s).

The rise of Gen AI is the major new development since Howden’s previous assessment of the threat landscape. Technologists, cyber security experts and the insurance market broadly agree that this new technology will transform offensive and defensive capabilities. Our research brings the debate forward by drawing out the specific ways in which Gen AI is most likely to increase the frequency, severity and aggregation of claims but also how the technology, along with existing risk controls, can be deployed to repel threat actors.

### Relevance

Over the past few years, carriers and brokers have undertaken important steps to enhance price stability, coverage clarity and the consistency of terms and conditions. Taken together, these actions present solid foundations for a new phase of development for the market.

Against this backdrop, the market has two stand out opportunities to preserve market leading annual growth and secure long-term relevance: expansion beyond the U.S. and serving a broader client base amongst small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across all regions.

Analysis in this report reveals that more than half of premium growth is likely to emanate from non-U.S. territories. In the major European economies of Germany, France, Italy and Spain alone, the premium uplift potential in just replicating penetration levels recorded in more mature markets can be measured in the (high) hundreds of millions of euros.

The SME space, which accounts for close to half of GDP in advanced economies, also offers huge opportunity as brokers and insurers find better ways to bring this currently underserved demographic into the cyber market.

Considerable progress has been made in a short space of time, but our research shows that more work needs to be done to meet demand globally. Innovation is crucial to tapping into new pools of capital and penetrating currently underserved markets.

Howden exists to do just that. We look forward to supporting clients (new and old) in finding the best risk transfer solutions and building cyber resilience in what remains a highly fluid threat landscape.

# 01 A pervasive threat

After a prolonged run of market leading growth, cyber insurance is entering a new phase in its journey to maturity.

Having navigated the early stages of development that often come with new, fast growing lines of business, competition is now increasing as insurers look to grow in a space that has huge potential and is relevant to businesses worldwide.

With little sign of the threat environment abating any time soon – the last 12 months have brought resurgent ransomware activity (including a number of high-profile attacks on healthcare entities), persistent geopolitical instability and the proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) – current market conditions offer clients and prospects an opportunity to secure protection at favourable terms.

## A pervasive threat

Strengthened cyber resilience is paying dividends for policyholders now attacks are reverting to the long run upward trend. After a temporary lull in 2022 due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ransomware activity has returned to historic high levels. There has also been a steady increase in U.S. privacy claims due to increased biometric breaches and pixel litigation following some high-profile settlements whilst the resurfacing of aggregation risk continues to hang over the market. Recent developments in both of these areas serve to talk to the tail-risk associated with cyber insurance.

All of which has led cyber to increasing its lead as the top global risk in this year’s Allianz Risk Barometer (see Figure 2). Reflecting the pervasive threat landscape, respondents ranked data breaches as the cyber exposure of most concern (59%), followed by attacks on critical infrastructure and physical assets (53%) and the increase in ransomware attacks (53%).¹

This elevated awareness of risk tallies with the release of several cyber-related policymaking publications in recent years, alongside growing references to cyber risk in corporates’ earnings calls (see Figure 3).

### Ransomware frequency

Ransomware continues to dominate the cyber loss environment. Given current levels of frequency and severity, ransomware looks set to be a source of significant losses for businesses for some time to come.

Figure 4 shows how the frequency of global ransomware attacks has trended since 2021. The availability of accessible (and low cost) ransomware kits, otherwise known as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), combined with the ongoing profitability of attacks, have been important factors in driving the proliferation of ransomware during this timeframe.

Fears that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 would fuel activity proved to be unfounded as both warring sides, host to some of the worst offending ransomware groups, focused their efforts and resources on kinetic warfare.

Ransomware activity has picked up significantly since then, however. Established gangs, facing depleted funds following a drop in revenues in 2022, along with the emergence of new groups, drove a marked acceleration in frequency last year. Figure 5 compares cumulative ransomware activity by month between 2022 and early 2024, with data from NCC Group showing frequency up 85% in FY23 compared to FY22.

Whilst increased pressure on gangs from law enforcement agencies (including efforts to take down Russian groups such as LockBit and BlackCat) has played a part in driving activity down from peak levels recorded in 3Q23, it does not appear to have had a decisive impact. Recorded incidents in the first five months of this year were up 18% on already elevated 2023 levels.

Law enforcement action has also emboldened cybercriminals to hit back at critical infrastructure, with U.S. healthcare providers Change Healthcare and Ascension falling victim to ransomware attacks in February and May this year. These attacks caused significant disruption to both companies and have triggered substantial first-party (in the case of Ascension) and third-party claims. A number of UK hospitals also suffered serious disruption in June following a ransomware attack on Synnovis, a provider of pathology services for the NHS.

Companies of all sizes continue to be targeted, with a noticeable bias towards the upper and lower bands of the revenue range (see Figure 6). Attackers’ tactics are predicated on maximising financial gain whilst minimising risks, with gangs weighing up victims’ ability to pay against security measures in place without provoking a response from law enforcement agencies.

## A pervasive threat

### Mixed severity

Ransomware frequency only tells part of the story from a loss perspective. The severity side of the equation is primarily made up of downtime costs (business interruption and lost productivity), ransom payments and other expenses. These can be more challenging to measure, particularly when factoring in intangible impacts such as reputational damage. Available data presents a nuanced picture, with recent large-scale attacks underlining how the ransom payment (if there is one) can be only the tip of the iceberg.

Whilst data from Chainalysis and Sophos shown in Figures 7 and 8 reveal how paid ransoms in dollars have increased in recent years, they mask an equally important trend away from payment. Coveware data in Figure 9 shows a marked decline in the proportion of companies paying ransoms between 2019 and early 2024, falling to 28% in 1Q24 compared to an average of 70% in 2020.

Companies that have invested in risk controls and crisis management are now less susceptible to material impacts, rebalancing cost-benefit considerations for some firms over whether to pay ransoms. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of double and even triple extortion has undermined the assumption that paying a ransom will put a stop to the hack.

## A pervasive threat

Ransom payments are just one input into losses sustained by companies. Data from Sophos and Coveware in Figure 10 compare mean ransom payments to mean recovery costs, with the latter accounting for the lion’s share of total costs through the timeframe.

According to S-RM, business interruption is typically the biggest cost component of a significant event, making up to 70% of claims costs where a firm is heavily reliant on the availability of critical systems in sectors such as manufacturing and financial services. Other ancillary costs can aggregate when there is significant regulatory exposure, or where multi-jurisdictional exposure brings the need to address various regulatory obligations.

### Building resilience

An increasing number of ransomware attacks now involve the theft of sensitive personal or commercial data for extortion purposes (i.e. threatening to leak data into the public domain), which not only increases the complexity of incidents but also brings a greater risk of reputational damage. Hardened cyber defences and secure backups have helped to mitigate business interruption losses, thereby insulating insured companies from prolonged disruption or outsized losses.

These conflicting dynamics continue to play out in the market, with peaks and troughs in ransomware frequency and severity indicative of fast-moving developments (see Figure 11 for data recorded by Coalition based on its own book of business since 2020).

Disclosures in 2023 and early 2024 nevertheless continue to show strong profitability for cyber insurance, reflecting price adequacy for a wide range of incidents, the success of risk controls in mitigating losses and the ability to adapt terms quickly given the short-tail nature of the business.

All of which portends runway for favourable market conditions more generally. As cyber lives up to its dynamic reputation, the value of insurance is being brought into even sharper focus as it incentivises (and helps to implement) better cyber hygiene, strengthens resilience and indemnifies losses.

# 02 Systemic cyber: the known unknown

Prevention, preparedness and protection are critical layers of defence in such a heightened threat environment. Improved risk management not only makes organisations more resilient to ransomware and other financially motivated cyber attacks, but it also means that they are better equipped to navigate a highly volatile geopolitical climate that increases the potential for larger-scale incidents.

The uncertainty around aggregation continues to hang over the market.

Risks associated with cyber warfare and systemic events more generally – scenarios where single attacks trigger widespread failures across multiple organisations – remain a concern but worst-case scenarios have not yet come to pass. The risk of and uncertainty around aggregation continues to hang over the market by impeding capital inflows and tempering risk appetite, but loss data to date shows that the most pervasive threat comes from targeted (and lower level) attacks carried out by criminal gangs rather than state actors.

Indeed, much of state-level cyber activity connected to current warzones has been integrated and contained to the kinetic campaign. This is indicative of shifting priorities during conflicts: cyber tactics and tools deemed most effective in supporting military goals (e.g. sabotage and / or disruption) are likely to take priority in certain phases.

Hostile governments nevertheless continue to shield criminal actors in their respective countries, allowing them to operate with near impunity when attacking Western companies and critical infrastructure (see the contribution from XCyber on pages 28-31). Healthcare has been a prime target for a number of years now, likely reflecting the prevalence of legacy (and interconnected) systems, large volumes of sensitive data and a relatively high willingness to pay ransoms to restore operations quickly and protect life.

Figure 12 on page 20 shows that the number of ransomware attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure increased by a CAGR of 35% between 2021 and 2023.

## Systemic cyber: the known unknown

### Warning shots

Systemic cyber attacks are highly uncertain in terms of trigger, likelihood and size. On the one hand, the potential for loss is clear – the proliferation of attack surfaces from rapid digitalisation, limited understanding of where and how technologies are vulnerable and a dearth of historical data on cyber catastrophes – but it is also true that only a small number of nation state actors or highly sophisticated groups have the capabilities, expertise and resources to execute such attacks. These actors
