# Global Cybersecurity Index 2024

## Report Summary

The fifth edition of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) measures the commitment of countries to cybersecurity in the context of measures across the following five pillars:

*   **Legal**
*   **Technical**
*   **Organizational**
*   **Capacity Development**
*   **Cooperation**

The GCI, launched in 2015 by the International Telecommunication Union, seeks to help countries to identify areas of improvement and encourage countries to act in building capacity and capabilities under each pillar. The GCI has been continuously adapted across editions to respond to changing risks, priorities and resources, in order to provide a more relevant snapshot of cybersecurity measures taken by countries.

| Countries measured | Collection years | Focal points from countries | Average overall score growth since 2020 |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| 194                | 2023-2024        | 172                         | 27%                                       |

Since 2021, countries have on average taken more cybersecurity-related actions and improved their commitments to cybersecurity. The global average country score has risen to 65.7/100.

Across the five GCI pillars, most countries are strongest in the legal pillar. By contrast, the average country is weakest in the capacity-development and technical pillars.

Each region has countries that are role-modelling or are advancing, and each region also has countries that are in the beginning stages of building their cybersecurity commitments. To capture these differences, country performance is measured across five tiers, with Tier 1 being the highest and Tier 5 the lowest. These tiers provide peer groups based on scores to help countries to understand and identify role models for improvement.

![Figure 1: Tier performance, by region](Image description: A bar chart showing the distribution of countries across five tiers (Tier 1 to Tier 5) for different regions. Tier 1 represents the highest performance, and Tier 5 the lowest. The chart indicates that most regions have countries in all tiers, with varying distributions.)

## Introduction

Robust and coordinated cybersecurity efforts by countries have become more important since the previous edition of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI). With approximately 5.4 billion people online,¹ even offline populations are impacted by continued acceleration of technological developments with the adoption of artificial intelligence, renewed efforts towards digitalization and widespread advances toward universal and meaningful connectivity.²

Cybersecurity issues have become more prominent, owing inter alia to:

1.  **Increased ransomware**: growing reports of ransomware attacks targeting government services and other critical sectors in many countries.³
2.  **Breaches affecting core industries**: the scale, frequency and intensity of cybersecurity incidents or breaches affecting individuals and various sectors including education, manufacturing, energy and IT services, to name but a few.
3.  **Privacy concerns**: data breaches resulted in European data protection authorities issuing General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fines worth over EUR 1.9 billion in 2023,⁴ with total GDPR fines issued since 2018 estimated to be currently worth more than EUR 4.5 billion.⁵
4.  **Cost to businesses**: the global average cost of a data breach was estimated at USD 4.45 million in 2023.
5.  **Outages**: information technology disruptions affecting the integrity and availability of systems, services and supply chains.⁶

It has been 35 years since the first International Telecommunication Union (ITU) cybersecurity standard, Recommendation ITU-T X.509, and a decade since the launch of the first GCI. During this time, ITU has worked with over 140 different Member States on their cybersecurity readiness, as cybersecurity has firmly emerged as a strategic imperative for governments, as well as for critical and non-critical sectors of society. Measuring the efforts towards improving cybersecurity has become a crucial touchstone for governments in driving development in the area. The GCI sits at the nexus of cybersecurity metrics, by assessing the measures taken by countries at the national level to improve their cybersecurity commitments. Based on the five work areas established in the 2008 Global Cybersecurity Agenda, i.e. legal measures, technical and procedural measures, organizational structures, capacity building and international cooperation, the GCI scores complement output-based measurements, such as number of cyberattacks and extent of vulnerabilities, among others. By contrasting the efforts taken by countries with cybersecurity outputs, countries, companies and civil society organizations can identify whether existing efforts need to be revisited or strengthened, how to prioritize future interventions, and how to begin to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures.

The fifth edition of the GCI explores the current level of cybersecurity commitment among 193 Member States and the State of Palestine and the progress made since the last edition. The GCI report examines the implications of the results for governments and policy-makers as they navigate national and regional circumstances, as well as global developments, while planning cybersecurity measures and initiatives. One of the key changes made in this edition is a shift from ranking countries to using a five-level tier for viewing countries' cybersecurity commitments. This tier-based perspective allows for greater focus on the extent of advances in cybersecurity commitments and what this may mean for countries. Moreover, given the nature of the cybersecurity landscape, there is always room for growth, refinement and adaptation regardless of a country’s GCI score. While a score of 100/100 reflects a strong cybersecurity commitment, it does not mean further work is not required in terms of adopting appropriate cybersecurity measures in response to countries’ shifting operating environments and the evolving cybersecurity ecosystem.

The GCI is used by countries, investment groups, development organizations, companies and other actors as an important tool in understanding cybersecurity commitments for several reasons, including:

*   **Comprehensive evidence-based cybersecurity measures**: the GCI takes a multi-dimensional approach to cybersecurity and relies on either publicly available data or verifiable evidence provided by countries. This approach leads to a trustworthy, more reliable view of cybersecurity commitments. As a result, countries have come to rely on the GCI to inform their national cybersecurity plans.
*   **Informing national policies**: countries can better understand their progress in key areas of cybersecurity and identify opportunities for further developments and innovations aligned with their national priorities and situational contexts.
*   **Fostering research and development**: the cybersecurity landscape’s dynamism necessitates proactive responses that include the identification or collection of data and the investigation and development of relevant cybersecurity artefacts, including new policies, laws and regulations, products and standards, among others.
*   **Benchmarking**: countries can assess their level of cybersecurity commitment and progress over time against global and regional averages.
*   **Enhancing cooperation**: with cooperation being a central part of good cybersecurity measures, opportunities for various levels of cooperation can be found and leveraged to support mutual strategic, operational and tactical cybersecurity responses.

To help countries consider their cybersecurity commitments considering the above issues, this edition of the GCI aims to be the most robust yet. It features greater clarity and refinement in questions, greater efforts to ensure consistency in verification and validation, while maintaining high-quality analysis. However, the GCI should be used with consideration for its limitations as it does not measure the quality of actions; it only assesses whether they are in place, partially in place/in progress or do not exist. ITU, in collaboration with the GCI Expert Group, will continue actively to seek ways of improving the relevance, rigour and validity of the indicators relied on and to better communicate results.

## Global view

Overall, the fifth edition of the GCI presents many countries working to improve their cybersecurity commitments through implementing relevant measures across the five pillars: legal, technical, organizational, capacity development and cooperation. To give a more accurate view of the clusters of performance within the GCI, the GCI has shifted to a tier-based presentation of country scores, using score ranges set by the GCI Expert Group. (For more information on the tiers and their development, see section Tiers.)

![Figure 2: GCI tier performance, by region (with counts)](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the distribution of countries across five tiers (Tier 1 to Tier 5) for different regions. Each bar represents a region, and the segments within the bar indicate the number of countries in each tier. Tier 1 is at the top, and Tier 5 at the bottom. The chart highlights that most regions have a significant number of countries in Tiers 3 and 4.)

Almost every region has high and low performing countries. This edition of the GCI has placed 46 countries in Tier 1 (T1), the highest tier. If the tier-based system had been applied to the fourth edition of the GCI⁷, 30 countries would have been placed in T1. Much of the movement to T1 comes from countries in Europe, Asia and the Pacific, the Arab States and Africa. These countries made significant improvements across the five GCI pillars since the last edition.

Most countries (105) were placed in T3 and T4, representing the many countries that have been expanding digital services and bringing people online but still have work to do to ensure that cybersecurity becomes part of their meaningful connectivity objectives.

Many of these countries also have a significant cyber-capacity gap: they are looking to enhance their cybersecurity but face resource limitations in terms of staffing, access to equipment and sustainable funding.

When comparing GCI scores against general information and communication technology (ICT) development, it should be noted that the scores do not necessarily trend in line with the ITU ICT Development Index (IDI), which measures universal connectivity and meaningful connectivity. There are many countries that are active on cybersecurity but still have a lower level of overall ICT development, meaning that they are well positioned to create a safe and trustworthy cyberspace as people come online. Inversely, there are many countries which perform above the IDI median score but lack many cybersecurity measures. While these countries may have prioritized initial ICT development over integrating cybersecurity as they contend with limited resources, they risk a more insecure and less resilient cyberspace for people already online.

![Figure 3: ITU ICT Development Index (2024) as compared to the Global Cybersecurity Index](Image description: A scatter plot comparing the ITU ICT Development Index (IDI) scores on the x-axis against the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) scores on the y-axis for various countries. The plot shows the relationship between ICT development and cybersecurity commitment, with some countries having high IDI but low GCI, and vice versa.)

## Legal measures

Legal measures tend to be countries’ strongest area of cybersecurity, but more still needs to be done.

![Figure 4: Legal measures, by region (one dot = one country)](Image description: A map of the world where each country is represented by a dot. The density or color of the dots in different regions indicates the level of legal measures in place for cybersecurity. Regions with more dots or darker colors suggest a higher prevalence of legal measures.)

Legal measures continue to be countries’ strongest pillar on average. More countries have implemented legal measures designating and clarifying cybersecurity-related concerns, from data protection to illegal online activities. There is evidence of increased harmonization among these laws and regulations, at least in terms of nomenclatures, such as aligning with GDPR or international cybercrime treaties. More countries are also adding or updating measures framed with technology-neutral language, creating increased flexibility in interpretation, and alignment between online and offline offences or obligations.

Efforts are still needed to ensure the specificity and application of laws and regulations. For example, some countries have ambiguities in breach notification requirements and their applications.

### Privacy laws and regulations are increasing, and increasingly needed.

![Figure 5: Number of countries with regulations on personal data protection, privacy protection and/or breach notification](Image description: A bar chart showing the number of countries that have regulations on personal data protection, privacy protection, and/or breach notification. The chart likely shows an increasing trend over time or across different categories of regulations.)

With 8 billion records being breached in 2023 across over 2,800 reported breaches,⁸ the average cost of a data breach has increased by 15 per cent over the past three years.⁹ These incidents can be costly: for small businesses in North America alone, the average breach is estimated to cost USD 3.3 million.¹⁰ Countries also risk users losing trust in ICTs due to these breaches. To provide recourse and rights for users as well as clear expectations for organizations handling data, countries have implemented regulations on personal data protection, privacy protection and/or breach notification.

The previous edition of the GCI noted that GDPR and similar legislation had driven an increase in the number of countries which had adopted privacy legislation and breach notification requirements. While the trend has begun to level out, more countries have also worked to ensure comparability between privacy regimes.

However, many countries can further clarify their privacy, data protection and breach notification laws and regulations. For example, not all countries have clearly defined what is the expected notification period for breaches, or the mandate of competent authorities to monitor and respond to breaches. In addition, these efforts can be complemented by capacity development, to ensure that relevant actors are well trained and aware of current cybersecurity threats.

## Technical measures

The data show a high disparity in implementation of technical measures as a means of supporting cybersecurity efforts at the national level.

![Figure 6: Technical measures, by region (one dot = one country)](Image description: A world map where each country is represented by a dot. The distribution and density of dots across different regions indicate the level of technical measures implemented for cybersecurity. Regions with more dots or darker colors suggest a higher prevalence of technical measures.)

Together with legal measures, technology plays a pivotal role as a line of defence against malicious online actors. Robust cybersecurity mechanisms require a combination of competent individuals, well-documented processes and procedures, and technology. These elements prepare and empower countries to prevent, protect and respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents.

Activities to detect, prevent, respond to and mitigate cyberthreats and incidents take place in a variety of structures such as computer incident response teams (CIRTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) and Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). Security operation centres (SOCs) and information-sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) can also perform some or all of these activities.

The relation between CIRTs and other agencies, particularly national cybersecurity coordination centres (NCCCs) or national cybersecurity authorities (NCAs), varies significantly between countries. While many countries have a national CIRT responsible for, inter alia, cyber-awareness activities, data collection and standards implementation, numerous NCCCs and NCAs have taken on these duties.

CIRTs are not only domestic focal points on incident response, they also serve as important international nodes to connect transnational cybersecurity incident response efforts. Events like regional and international cyber-drills can be important in this regard, as national CIRTs can interact with peers and establish informal and formal connections.

Moreover, participation in international fora, such as the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), as well as regional fora, such as the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT), the Pacific Cyber Security Operational Network (PaCSON), AfricaCERT, the European Union Cyber Security Agency (ENISA), the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Organization of American States, is of paramount importance for CIRTs, as it provides a platform for knowledge-sharing, collaboration and capacity development among cybersecurity professionals worldwide. Some 98 countries reported being part of FIRST or listed TF-CSIRT, with six in the process of joining, while 115 reported being part of regional CIRT organizations.

Standards also figure among best practices for implementation under the technical pillar. As standards undergo rigorous evaluation by experts, they can provide clear roadmaps on how to structure cybersecurity initiatives, teams and technologies. With a proliferation of relevant standards and qualifications, 110 countries had some sort of framework in place for the implementation of cybersecurity standards.

Standards can also help to bridge certain fundamental security gaps that still persist. Globally, between 14 per cent and 35 per cent of regions’ mail services are not using secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) protocols or ciphers, or are using insecure or weak ones.¹¹ Between only 1 per cent and 4.6 per cent of mail services use the recommended implementation of SSL/TLS, with the rest using some sort of secure protocol.

### CIRTs are playing a key role in the cybersecurity ecosystem.

![Figure 7: Percentage of countries with a CIRT, by region/income group/development status](Image description: A bar chart showing the percentage of countries that have a Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT), broken down by region, income group, and development status. This allows for comparison of CIRT adoption across different categories.)

CIRTs, CSIRTs, CERTs, SOCs, ISACs and other teams monitor threats and help to respond in the event of a cybersecurity incident. With an estimated 68 per cent of organizations suffering a cyberattack in 2023,¹² CIRTs have become more important than ever. Based on current data, 139 countries have a national CIRT, while 55 do not have a CIRT or national CIRT in progress.

¹¹ Dreamlab Technologies research data on SSL/TLS implementation for mail protocols (SMTPS, POP3S, IMAPS), November 2023.
¹² https://www.netwrix.com/2023_hybrid_security_trends_report.html

Beyond their immediate function of incident response, CIRTs serve as a catalyst for broader engagement within organizations, fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness and resilience. By conducting coordinated responses to cyber-incidents, CIRTs not only mitigate immediate risks but also lay the groundwork for proactive security measures and continuous improvement in organizational cybersecurity posture. For example, CIRTs can monitor and drive implementation of best practices, such as Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and security vulnerability disclosure.

For example, to ensure that the domain name system (DNS) is safe and authenticates responses to domain name lookups, only 0.43 per cent of African providers have implemented DNSSEC, compared to a higher adoption rate of 13.13 per cent in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region. Regions with high numbers of Internet users, such as Asia and the Pacific, only have a 1.52 per cent adoption of DNSSEC, versus 11.28 per cent in Europe.¹³

CIRTs can also drive security disclosures. For example, websites can adopt security.txt,¹⁴ which includes key contact information in the event of a vulnerability discovery, as well as relevant policies and acknowledgements. Currently, this is underused globally, with less than 0.7 per cent of sites using this mechanism.¹⁵

The presence of a CIRT is most likely in high-income countries (globally, 89 per cent of such countries have a national CIRT), with upper-middle and lower-middle income countries less likely (70 per cent and 67 per cent, respectively). Some 46 per cent of lower-income countries had an operational national CIRT as of 2024.

The ability to respond to an incident varies based on the country’s investment, local capacity and overall organization.

To enhance preparedness and capabilities, CIRTs, as well as cybersecurity authorities, are increasingly running cybersecurity simulation exercises (cyber drills) among stakeholders. While 140 countries participated in regional cyber drills organized by ITU in 2023, running national cyber drills remains important to engage domestic stakeholders in hands-on exercises. National cyber drills can engage a wider set of domestic actors than regional or international cyber drills do and can be better tailored to the national context.

![Figure 8: Percentage of countries with CIRTs and running cyber drills, by region/income group](Image description: A bar chart comparing the percentage of countries with CIRTs and those running cyber drills, segmented by region and income group. This visualization helps to understand the correlation and differences in these two aspects of technical cybersecurity measures.)

### Sectoral CIRTs are being implemented to address specific sectoral needs.

![Figure 9: Countries with a sectoral CIRT, by region/income group/development status](Image description: A bar chart showing the number or percentage of countries that have a sectoral Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT), broken down by region, income group, and development status. This highlights the adoption of specialized CIRTs in different contexts.)

While some countries choose to rely on national CIRTs to support all sectors, sectoral CIRTs also have an important role to play. Specific sectors of industry face different threats and have different incident-response needs depending on whether they are part of critical infrastructure and on their supply chain, etc. For example, 25.7 per cent of all cyberattacks in 2023 targeted the manufacturing sector; of those attacks, 45 per cent used malware and 17 per cent used ransomware. By contrast 18.2 per cent of all cyberattacks targeted the finance and insurance sectors, with 38 per cent of the attacks using malware and 25 per cent using ransomware.¹⁶ Sectoral CIRTs can be better positioned than national CIRTs to respond to a particular sector’s profile in terms of the technologies used, specific vulnerabilities and remediation needs in the event of an attack.

As was the case in the fourth edition of the GCI, sectoral CIRTs are less common than national CIRTs. A number of countries participate in regional sectoral CIRTs, such as regional financial CIRTs, which allow for the leveraging of joint resources with other countries to tackle common issues.

Not all countries have the capacity and resources to implement sectoral CIRTs. For them, as well as countries with sectoral CIRTs, prioritization is key to ensure that relevant sectors receive the tailored support needed to manage cybersecurity risks. Low-income countries and small island developing States in particular are less likely to have sectoral CIRTs, as many have focused their efforts on the process of developing, or enhancing, their national CIRT. As these countries’ ICT infrastructure continues to develop, addressing the cybersecurity needs of sectors can be met domestically or through regional CIRTs.

## Organizational measures

Greater coordination and alignment are necessary for shaping more data-driven and inclusive national cybersecurity efforts.

![Figure 10: Organizational measures, by region (one dot = one country)](Image description: A world map where each country is represented by a dot. The distribution and density of dots across different regions indicate the level of organizational measures implemented for cybersecurity. Regions with more dots or darker colors suggest a higher prevalence of organizational measures.)

Organizational measures are necessary for the proper implementation of a national cybersecurity posture and help to guide effective implementation. Many countries have made strides in ensuring that there are clear strategic objectives, with a comprehensive plan in implementation, delivery and measurement. Without a well-defined organizational network of partners, working together across industry, civil society and academia efforts in different sectors and industries become disparate and unconnected, thwarting efforts towards national harmonization in cybersecurity development.

National cybersecurity strategies are a primary tool towards developing an effective organizational framework. Beyond national cybersecurity strategies, countries have also been working to develop clear metrics and measures to understand how to track outputs of cybersecurity at the national level, and track in-depth inputs of cybersecurity such as audits. Translating these metrics to policy and implementation requires clear roles and responsibilities, as well as responsive organizational frameworks.

### More countries have a national cybersecurity strategy.

National cybersecurity strategies (NCSs) have become an increasingly common tool for governments to organize around cybersecurity. As of 2024, 132 countries have an NCS, up from 107 in 2020. Much of this progress can be attributed to the Africa region, where nine countries have ushered in their first NCS. In addition, many countries have worked to revise and update their existing strategies.

The breadth and depth of NCSs vary considerably. The second edition of the Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy recommends several key areas for countries to consider incorporating into their NCSs. Only 85 out of the 132 countries with an NCS include the following measures:

*   cybersecurity of critical infrastructure;
*   lifecycle management principles;
*   stakeholder engagement; and
*   an action plan.

The quality of each of these measures can also be addressed. Countries most often implement practices like stakeholder engagement and lifecycle management at the beginning or end of their NCS, instead of integrating these concepts through the NCS lifecycle. As a result, they miss out on valuable feedback related to the NCS, opportunities to ensure that domestic stakeholders are aligned on key priorities and the chance to adapt where necessary to help to ensure that the NCS remains relevant and effective over time.

For example, some countries leveraged their action plans to ensure that best practices and recommended activities were implemented, and used lessons learned from the action plan to update and revise their NCS.

Having an action plan does not guarantee that all best practices are prioritized or incorporated. For example, cybersecurity audits are a commonly accepted best practice to assess and analyse organizations’ cybersecurity and cyber-risks. Yet many countries do not have them in their action plan. As shown in Figure 11, while there are 64 countries that have an NCS with an action plan and have carried out national cybersecurity audits, 19 countries with an NCS and an action plan did not do national cybersecurity audits.

![Figure 11: Overlap of having an NCS with an action plan and conducting national cybersecurity audits](Image description: A Venn diagram or a similar visualization showing the overlap between countries that have a National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) with an action plan and those that have conducted national cybersecurity audits. It highlights the number of countries in each category and their intersections.)

### Critical information infrastructure efforts often lack supporting legal measures.

![Figure 12: Percentage of countries which have measures in force related to critical information infrastructure, by region](Image description: A bar chart showing the percentage of countries that have measures in force related to critical information infrastructure, broken down by region. This visualization helps to compare the prevalence of CII protection measures across different geographical areas.)

Critical information infrastructure (CII) is tackled in the GCI through questions under the legal, technical, organizational and capacity-development pillars. Developing a synergistic CII ecosystem involves addressing all these pillars in concert and ensuring that the measures reflect current threats and vulnerabilities. Considering the questions on CII under the legal and organizational pillars, the most common feature is to have an agency responsible for CII cybersecurity.

With 54 per cent of countries globally having an agency, ministry or other entity bearing responsibility for CII cybersecurity, only 49 per cent of countries globally have such a framework in place, or being put in place, to implement cybersecurity standards in relation to CII.

To ensure that professionals working on CII, such as those in the telecommunication or energy sectors, are well prepared to manage cybersecurity risks and respond to incidents, training is important. Some 90 per cent of countries with an NCS that addresses CII and with a responsible agency have conducted sector-specific training for cybersecurity professionals.

### Implementation of child online protection strategies and initiatives remains limited.

![Figure 13: Countries with national child online protection strategies, with associated current child online protection initiatives, by region](Image description: A map or a chart showing the number or percentage of countries that have national child online protection strategies and associated initiatives, broken down by region. This visualization highlights the regional disparities in child online protection efforts.)

It is estimated that every half a second, a child goes online for the first time.¹⁷ In addition, the 2023 Child Online Safety Index (COSI) found that nearly 70 per cent of children and adolescents aged 8-18 years old worldwide have experienced at least one cyber-risk incident in the past year.¹⁸ With this in mind, child online protection has long been a building block for collaboration between law enforcement, policy-makers, educators, parents, advocates and other stakeholders. To coordinate these stakeholders’ efforts, child online protection strategies with associated initiatives are needed.

In this edition, 164 countries reported having legal measures on child online protection, compared to 130 countries in the previous edition of the GCI.¹⁹ These measures were sometimes part of other rules and regulations, such as on online crime or sexual exploitation. Despite most countries having laws and regulations on child online protection, only 94 countries globally have strategies with associated current child online protection initiatives in place. Activities included awareness-raising campaigns, training for educators, training for police, and reporting mechanisms, among others. These activities are targeting a wide range of ages, as not only young children are at risk.

![Figure 14: Example child online protection initiative, offered by ITU with partners](Image description: An image or graphic illustrating an example of a child online protection initiative, possibly featuring logos of ITU and its partners, and a brief description of the initiative's goals or activities.)

As children continue to come online, they need to be both protected and empowered in order to become active participants in creating a safe and trustworthy cyberspace. For this to happen, parents, teachers, policy-makers, law enforcement, public sector actors and other stakeholders need to be able to support children and youth in their digital journeys and need to understand the risks and challenges facing children online.

## Capacity-development measures

Cybersecurity training and awareness efforts vary across regions against the backdrop of efforts to develop a strong industry.

![Figure 15: Capacity-development measures, by region (one dot = one country)](Image description: A world map where each country is represented by a dot. The distribution and density of dots across different regions indicate the level of capacity-development measures implemented for cybersecurity. Regions with more dots or darker colors suggest a higher prevalence of capacity-development measures.)

Capacity development is key to building a robust cybersecurity ecosystem. Countries risk eroding progress that has been made in enhancing full and universal connectivity if they do not support cybersecurity skills and awareness-raising. Over 95 per cent of countries have some activity under the capacity-development pillar, with the most activities reported in the awareness-raising campaign category.

Efforts to develop a domestic cybersecurity industry were also present in many countries, taking the form of incentive mechanisms, such as grants and scholarships, and organizations acting to promote the cybersecurity industry. Such initiatives can increase the level of cybersecurity in a country beyond the level that may have developed without government support.

Research and development (R&D) was also tracked as part of efforts to develop domestic capacity. Some 127 countries reported some form of R&D, whether through the private sector, public sector or academia, with academia being the most common centre for R&D.

### Countries are increasingly targeting specific demographics as part of cyber-awareness campaigns.

![Figure 16: Number of countries with targeted cyber-awareness campaigns beyond the general population, global](Image description: A bar chart showing the number of countries that conduct targeted cyber-awareness campaigns beyond the general population, globally. This visualization helps to understand the extent of specialized awareness efforts.)

Creating a culture of cybersecurity is an ongoing challenge for all countries. Awareness-raising campaigns, which seek to inform users and change behaviours, are developed or supported, with 152 countries reporting having a cybersecurity awareness-raising campaign aimed at the general public. In addition, 130 countries had some form of targeted cyber-awareness campaign carried out or planned, with 52 per cent of those targeting four or more different demographic groups. Some 20 countries reported upcoming, planned or in-progress targeted cybersecurity awareness campaigns.

Targeted awareness-raising campaigns serve as vital tools in identifying specific threats and educating individuals and organizations about cybersecurity threats and best practices. The effectiveness of such campaigns, however, often hinges on the metrics used to track impact, particularly when the campaigns are primarily conducted on social media platforms. While social media offer extensive reach and engagement potential, relying solely on metrics such as likes, shares and comments may not accurately gauge the campaigns' true efficacy in raising awareness and changing behaviour. Instead, there is a growing recognition of the need for human-centred approaches that resonate with people's realities and address their specific concerns and challenges in navigating the digital landscape securely. This requires the tailoring of awareness-raising campaigns to diverse audiences, considering factors such as cultural context, digital literacy levels and socio-economic backgrounds. By adopting a more nuanced approach that prioritizes meaningful engagement and behavioural outcomes over superficial metrics, organizations can ensure that their awareness campaigns effectively empower individuals to protect themselves against cyberthreats and contribute to building a safer online environment for all.

### Many countries still lack cybersecurity skill development programmes across educational levels.

This visualization highlights regional differences in educational integration of cybersecurity.)

While the cybersecurity workforce grew 8.7 per cent from 2022 to 2023, the gap between the workers needed and the number available has also grown, by 12.6 per cent.²⁰ To address this gap, countries are increasingly seeking to develop cybersecurity skills within their population by incorporating cybersecurity into school curricula at the primary (61 countries) and secondary (68 countries) levels, as well as in university-level courses and programmes (137 countries).

Beyond formal schooling, countries are offering training programmes that target youth (85 countries) and cybersecurity professionals (123 countries).

To ensure that a domestic cybersecurity industry can flourish, countries can work to ensure that the variety of educational opportunities available at different ages sufficiently prepare students and professionals for their careers.

## Cooperation measures

Operationalization and impact of agreements and frameworks remains a challenge.

The distribution and density of dots across different regions indicate the level of cooperation measures implemented for cybersecurity. Regions with more dots or darker colors suggest a higher prevalence of cooperation measures.)

Cybersecurity is a complex, interconnected challenge necessitating a holistic, multistakeholder approach. Given its transnational character, effective response demands cooperation across public, private and government sectors. The past decades have been characterized by a variety of efforts to build international cooperation and coordination, including the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which entered into force in 2004; the African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (Malabo Convention), which came into effect in 2023; and the Commonwealth of Independent States Agreement on Cooperation in the Fight Against Crimes in the Field of Information Technologies (Dushanbe Agreement), which came into force in 2020. In addition, cybersecurity efforts have
