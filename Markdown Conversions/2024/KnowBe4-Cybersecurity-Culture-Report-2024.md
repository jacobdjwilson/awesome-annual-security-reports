## Introduction

Human factors are crucial to the integrity of an organization’s cybersecurity framework. As highlighted by Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, a vast majority—74%—of data breaches stem from manipulative social engineering techniques and human error or oversight. As organizations fortify their technical cybersecurity defenses, adversaries rapidly adapt, opting for simpler methods of system infiltration. Cybercriminals tend to bypass the daunting task of breaching advanced technological security measures and instead focus on targeting human susceptibilities.

Consequently, employees have emerged as the preferred target for these adversaries. This positions your workforce as either your most critical defense layer, or your weakest link…you choose. The collective knowledge, attitudes and conduct of employees significantly determine an organization’s susceptibility to cyber threats. Therefore, it is imperative to cultivate a strong security culture within the workplace. Employees are at the heart of an organization’s operations and can transform into a formidable human firewall, but only if an organization invests in empowering them to recognize and respond to cyber attacks.

## The KnowBe4 Security Culture Report

The Security Culture Report is a comprehensive yearly publication crafted by the premier organization in security culture research, KnowBe4 Research. This document stands out as the most in-depth and comprehensive analysis available, offering survey findings from thousands of organizations across the globe and a rich five-year comparative perspective.

This report represents a treasure trove of data-driven insights, brought to life with easy-to-understand graphics. It dives deep into how security measures really affect organizations and the way people act and feel at work. It’s become the go-to guide for understanding the true power of a strong security culture. With its broad coverage, there’s nothing else quite like it out there.

### 18 Industries, 6 Continents, 111 Countries

Additionally, the report presents an intricate and exhaustive examination of 18 industries, assessing each one’s security culture readiness. It does not stop at industry-specific evaluations but extends to furnish regional insights that encompass North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and an additional noteworthy global overview.

A robust security infrastructure hinges on a multi-tiered strategy, with its foundation firmly rooted in the human element. It is essential for security culture to evolve into a persistent, ingrained practice that every member of the organization embraces as a standard operating practice. Such a culture must be like second nature—and thoroughly integrated in every layer of the organization.

The 2024 Security Culture Report is the most comprehensive study of security culture available. It stands as a comprehensive tool, equipping yourself with the knowledge and strategies to foster a more security-conscious culture within your organization.

## What is Security Culture?

KnowBe4 defines “security culture” as the ideas, customs and social behaviors that influence an organization’s security. Security culture is best understood as the collective mindset, practices and norms that shape how an organization approaches and prioritizes security. This encompasses shared knowledge and thinking patterns, ingrained habits of staff and employees’ demonstrated behaviors in any setting where they carry out their professional duties. When referring to the workplace, we apply a broad view of where and how work is conducted and define security in similarly broad terms.

Under this concept, organizations are encouraged to direct their energy toward boosting employee involvement through evaluations and training, refining processes and protocols and adopting technologies that simplify adherence to security best practices.

For those seeking a more comprehensive exploration of security culture and strategic guidance on establishing a robust security culture program, “The Security Culture Playbook, An Exclusive Guide To Reducing Risk and Developing Your Human Defense Layer” authored by Perry Carpenter and Kai Roer, published in 2022 by Wiley, is an excellent resource.

## Security Culture Dimensions

We systematically evaluate culture across seven distinct dimensions:

- **Attitudes**: The feelings and beliefs that employees have toward the security protocols and issues.
- **Behaviors**: The actions and activities of employees that have direct or indirect impact on the security of the organization.
- **Cognition**: Employees’ understanding, knowledge and awareness of security issues and activities.
- **Communication**: The quality of communication channels to discuss security-related topics, promote a sense of belonging and provide support for security issues and incident reporting.
- **Compliance**: The knowledge of written security policies and the extent that employees follow them.
- **Norms**: The knowledge of and adherence to unwritten rules of conduct in the organization.
- **Responsibilities**: How employees perceive their role as a critical factor in sustaining or endangering the security of the organization.

## Security Culture Index

The Security Culture Index (SCI) is the global index for rating organizations based on their security culture score. The index was created by KnowBe4 Research and is calculated by analyzing the security culture of thousands of organizations around the world.

| Score Range | Rating |
| :--- | :--- |
| 90 up to 100 | Excellent |
| 80 up to 89 | Good |
| 70 up to 79 | Moderate |
| 60 up to 69 | Mediocre |
| 0 up to 59 | Poor |

**Note**: None of the industry sectors have demonstrated Excellent or Good security culture this year.

## The Security Culture Maturity Model

The KnowBe4 Research team has pioneered the Security Culture Maturity Model, an industry-first tool designed specifically to assess security culture, underpinned by a robust, data-driven and empirical approach. This innovative model draws on the extensive set of security awareness, behavior and culture data collected by KnowBe4, ensuring a comprehensive and insightful evaluation of an organization’s security posture.

![Security Culture Maturity Model chart showing five levels of progression. A dashed red line represents breach likelihood and relative cost remediation (decreasing as maturity increases). A solid blue line represents awareness/culture maturity gains at each stage.]

## The 5 Maturity Levels

The model describes a spectrum that includes organizations at the most basic level of compliance, where there is little to no conscious strategy for fostering awareness, behavior, or a security-centric culture (Level 1). We then look at organizations with a Sustainable Security Culture (Level 5). These organizations not only meet but exceed standard expectations, and endeavor to influence even the informal norms and social dynamics that shape their employees’ attitudes toward security.

| Level | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | **Basic Compliance** | Bare minimum of training; Limited metrics; “Check the box” |
| **Level 2** | **Security Awareness Foundation** | At least annual and onboarding training; Occasional phishing simulations; Focus on variety of content |
| **Level 3** | **Programmatic Security Awareness & Behavior** | Intentional awareness program with integrated tools; Quarterly training with simulated phishing; Focus on security-aware behaviors |
| **Level 4** | **Security Behavior Management** | Continuous training across varied delivery methods and audiences; Heavy use of integrated tools to inform training strategy; Program focused on real behavior change |
| **Level 5** | **Sustainable Security Culture** | Program that intentionally measures, shapes and reinforces security culture; Multiple methods of behavior-based encouragement; Security values woven through fabric of entire organization |

## Global Overview
**By Javvad Malik, Lead Security Awareness Advocate**

### Cultural Adoption
The world may be your oyster, but how does it fare when looking at cybersecurity culture? Approximately 5.35 billion people have internet access, which means 66.2% of the global population are potential targets for criminals. Against this backdrop, strengthening security cultures is more than a corporate challenge. It’s a societal imperative.

Organizations around the world vary greatly in how deliberate they are in building a strong security culture that aligns with their risk tolerance and overall culture. While many governments and organizations have attempted to implement some form of cybersecurity strategy, their efforts have met varying degrees of success.

Many organizations approach cybersecurity culture in the same way they approach a technology project. However, what works for computers and networks doesn’t translate well when dealing with humans. This can be why practical steps to build a strong culture falter or regress into a compliance exercise. Such faltering mirrors the outdated security awareness and training models of years gone by, when employees were subjected to an annual dose of awareness training.

### General Attitudes
The maturity levels of security culture vary greatly across the globe. In some areas, individuals are more aware and vigilant of threats at a personal level, but these do not automatically translate to organizations. In other areas, threats are viewed more as an organizational challenge that does not impact individuals personally.

Anecdotally, it appears security culture grows stronger where it is relevant not just to an organization, but to individuals—when it is something they can take home to share with friends and family. On a positive note, it appears as if more organizations are embedding cybersecurity initiatives beyond technological controls and understanding that people form an important part in creating a strong security culture.

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)
There are many existing, updated and new regulatory requirements globally that attempt to bring cybersecurity front of mind within organizations. However, many of these fall short by focusing on technological controls, breach notification requirements or basic awareness. While these are fundamental building blocks of a security culture, they alone cannot sufficiently move the needle.

### Security Events/Prevalent Issues
There are many issues around the globe impacting organizations when it comes to security culture. Cyber crime remains a priority for many organizations. The focus is largely on issues such as ransomware while ignoring the fact that social engineering remains the most prevalent method of deploying ransomware.

In 2023, these events left a lasting impact. The shifts to remote or hybrid working models required rapid deployment of technology and incurred cyber debt in the process, which negatively impacted many organizations.

As the COVID-induced panic buying of toilet rolls was starting to wane, global events introduced a new set of complex risks. In 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, while the following year brought escalating conflict in the Middle East. These are significant because we’ve seen how cybersecurity has played a prominent role not only among those directly involved in such conflicts but also among supporters from afar.

### Dimensions
In 2023, we collected insights on 816,733 employees representing 4,078 organizations. The overall security culture score globally stands at 72 (low moderate), unchanged from the prior year. As one would expect, smaller organizations tend to have higher culture scores. It’s far easier to change the culture of a smaller group than a larger one. In fact, Behaviors was the only dimension in which large organizations scored higher than others.

Globally there seems to be less understanding, knowledge and awareness of security, as well as less responsibility. While there is a great deal of variance depending on geographical location, organization size and industry, the sobering fact is that there is much work still to be done in order to raise the standard in culture.

### AI Influences
Of all new technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) will probably have some of the most profound cybersecurity impacts on organizations and individuals. AI is already being used to facilitate disinformation and misinformation campaigns, enhance social engineering attacks, and automate multi-layered and multi-faceted attacks at scale—even by attackers with little technical know-how.

In the coming months and years, as elections, wars and other notable events occur, AI will emerge as an increasingly important tool in the arsenal of criminals. With low awareness and a lack of effective regulation, by the time governments and regulators agree on a way forward, it could be too late.

### Key Takeaways
Security culture greatly varies across the world. That’s a problem in our fully connected world, where a mobile phone in the middle of a desert can interact with a stock market trading account as well as a banker in an office on Wall Street. A siloed approach is not sustainable. Governments need to collaborate more closely with each other and with regulators not just to define legislation, but also to demonstrate and embed the practical steps needed to build a strong culture.

For their part, organizations need to look at the human challenge and not treat this as a technological issue. Unlike patching computers, “patching” humans requires a sustained effort of awareness and training. To quote Nelson Mandela, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”

## North America
**By Erich Kron, Security Awareness Advocate**

### Cultural Adoption
The importance of security culture is gaining momentum in North American organizations, especially among leaders. The North American Manufacturing sector has sustained a decades-long emphasis on security culture, and organizations across industries have observed the fruits of this labor: safer working environments and fewer accidents. North American leaders understand how a strong culture can have similar positive impacts on cybersecurity. Many of the organizations that have successfully built a strong safety culture are applying the same strategy and tactics to improve their security culture.

Alongside cultural awareness, supply chain, vendor management, and all other types of third-party risk have become a hot topic. As such, smaller organizations supplying goods and/or services to large organizations must address their own security culture or risk losing large contracts. For organizations operating in countries that require strong physical security, the need for cybersecurity is more of an evolution than a new idea.

### General Attitudes
Organizations across North America are realizing that cybersecurity is a critical part of business. They recognize that employees aren’t the weakest link; rather, they are a key defense against these attacks. For their part, employees are realizing that while they are not expected to be cybersecurity experts, they do have a significant role in the organization’s cybersecurity readiness. Employees are learning that cyber attacks do not cease to be a threat when they head home for the day. Cyber risks are becoming a part of people’s personal lives, as well. As a result, they often become much more receptive to education and learning habits that can protect them personally.

The KnowBe4 survey found that organizations that deal with money are top performers in the security culture game. This makes sense given the stakes. Organizations in the Insurance, Financial Services and Banking industry have been targets of traditional and cyber crime for decades, so a higher level of security culture is not unexpected. Unfortunately, the Education industry comes in last with a score of 69, eight points off the leaders. This industry is often understaffed, with funding being a major hindrance. This translates into tired, hurried people, a favored target for cybercriminals. These U.S. security culture scores are similar to those across the rest of North America (Canada and Mexico).

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)
While there are a number of significant data privacy and security regulations that can impact organizations in North America, one of the more significant is related to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that publicly traded companies report a material cybersecurity incident within four business days of materiality determination.

### Security Events/Prevalent Issues
Ransomware continues to be the hot topic for both executives and security practitioners due to the resulting damages and other impacts, which are often transparent to the general public. Some top new stories highlighted Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts and Clorox as targets of the same ransomware group, with losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars and countless hours of downtime.

### Dimensions
As with industry comparisons, survey data for the U.S. versus North America as a whole are quite similar, with small organizations beating out the larger ones in overall score. It’s not surprising to see that large organizations may lag in some dimensions. A key part of establishing a good security culture is communication from leadership, something that tends to be much easier for small organizations. In addition, with fewer people on staff, it makes sense that employees of smaller organizations may feel more responsibility for security. For them, it’s just another of many hats they wear as part of a small company. Among the regions evaluated in the report, North America, which represents the highest number of employees/organizations surveyed, experienced a slight decline in overall security culture score, falling one point to 73 (low moderate).

### Language Localization
Language localization is very important when working to influence security culture. While some people confuse localization with translation, the two are very different when it comes to impacting culture. Using locally relevant phrases or situations aids understanding much more than simply changing a word or phrase from English to another language. This nuance can also be important when communicating with employees who speak the same language but in different parts of the world. U.S. English, Canadian English and UK English may seem similar but can be miles (or meters) apart when it comes to making a point resonate with an audience.

### AI Influences
There is no question that AI is a hot topic, but it does not represent a completely new attack vector. Much like a certain search engine fundamentally changed the way we use the internet by making things more efficient, AI will do the same for cyber crime. It will help attackers scale up attack volumes; it will dramatically improve translations; and AI-generated deepfakes will become a valuable tool. Even so, attacks will continue to follow the same core formula. Attackers will use phishing to elicit emotional responses, and scared victims will make mistakes by wiring money or introducing malware into systems. Ultimately, defense will be the same—that is, watch for the usual signs of a social engineering ploy.

### Key Takeaways
Security culture discussions have hit the boardroom, and organizations are understanding the importance of the human factor in a successful security program. Vendors are being scrutinized more than ever and are expected to have a strong security culture themselves—simply because it is too risky to do business with soft targets for cybercriminals.

Financial organizations and those that handle large sums of money continue to lead the charge simply because the stakes are so high. Unfortunately, Government, Manufacturing and Education represented some of the lowest scores despite being some of the biggest targets, including for ransomware. In those industries, it’s crucial to spend money and other resources very wisely simply due to their scarcity.

## South America
**By Joanna Huisman, Senior Vice President of Strategic Insights and Research**

### Cultural Adoption
Organizations in South America are grappling with the significantly rising challenges of cyber attacks. According to the Council on Foreign Affairs, the region is often neglected for several compelling reasons. To begin with, threat intelligence firms have limited motivation to prioritize South America ahead of more expansive markets. Additionally, cybersecurity domains tend to concentrate on well-known, prominent threat actors, neglecting the rise of nascent ones. Finally, the uneven levels of development throughout the region result in markedly diverse cybersecurity requirements among the various countries.

Moreover, there is a significant communication gap between nations. Influential leaders fail to engage in the necessary dialogues that span borders, leading to systemic unpreparedness within organizations to effectively confront the core issues. This deficiency cascades to the workforce, where employees lack the requisite training to detect, report and prevent attacks. The root of the issue lies in the fact that employees may lack awareness, feel a sense of disconnection from responsibility, or exhibit apathy toward the situation.

To address this issue, organizations must first look at the human factors and adopt comprehensive, continuous training and testing to drive strong cyber hygiene practices across the workforce. This, coupled with robust business continuity plans and proactive prevention strategies, will help shift momentum toward fostering a culture where employees adopt more secure behaviors and take appropriate ownership of cybersecurity.

### General Attitudes
Recent research indicates that cyber attacks are escalating rapidly in South America, with phishing and ransomware emerging as the primary tactics. To combat these threats, security awareness training remains an essential countermeasure. Improving the security culture within South American companies requires a thorough examination of various cultural dimensions to pinpoint specific weaknesses.

By reassessing and refining their strategies accordingly, organizations can foster a more robust security culture. This heightened state of preparedness—where employees are well-informed and the company actively promotes and disseminates knowledge—can have a positive, transformative impact on security culture. Low scores in the Responsibilities dimension underscore a lack of investment in cultivating the human aspect of security, which is crucial for recognizing and responding to social engineering attacks.

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)
Cybersecurity frameworks across South America display a spectrum of development. Colombia is at the forefront, boasting a robust set of cybersecurity, cyber defense and risk management strategies outlined in the National Council of Economic and Social Policy (CONPES). This policy delineates an incisive scheme for cybersecurity measures designed to bolster digital safety for individuals and the nation, detailing the entities mandated to enforce regulations and manage risks.

Brazil delegates its information security coordination to the Institutional Security Office of the Presidency (GSI). In line with a presidential directive, the GSI played a pivotal role in formulating the National Information Security Policy, which proposes the formulation of quintuple strategic pillars: cybersecurity, cyber defense, the safeguarding of critical infrastructure, the security of classified information and the prevention of data breaches. Argentina puts a premium on data privacy, championed by its Personal Data Protection Law. This law is stringently executed by the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and has garnered recognition from the European Commission for its parity with established international privacy regulations, such as the GDPR. Chile’s cybersecurity policy for 2023-28 sets its sights on creating a resilient digital framework that prioritizes user rights, cultivates a security-conscious culture, and fosters both national and international collaboration. This policy further aims to stimulate the cybersecurity industry and scientific inquiry within the field.

### Security Events/Prevalent Issues
According to Infosecurity Magazine, in 2023 South America stood out as one of two regions that did not witness a decline in data breaches, with incidents impacting over two million accounts. (The other, Antarctica, is not included in this assessment.) Notably, in September of the same year, Colombia suffered a significant cyber onslaught targeting numerous websites. It was one of the largest against its digital infrastructure and indeed within South America in recent memory.

### Dimensions
For South America, the overall security culture score is categorized as low moderate, standing at 71. We strongly advise entities in these areas to adopt robust security culture practices, which should include both training and evaluative measures. Peru and Ecuador are at the upper end of the spectrum, each securing a mid-moderate tally of 74. Paraguay is on the lower end with a score of 67, indicating a mid-mediocre security culture. Paraguay’s assessment reveals a disparity between perception and knowledge; its Cognition score of only 59 demonstrates a considerable gap in understanding security threats. Conversely, the Attitudes score stands at 75, indicating that while employees recognize the importance of security, their grasp of the threats and how to apply their training effectively is lacking.

Peru and Ecuador face similar challenges in the dimensions of Cognition and Responsibilities, suggesting that employees lack essential training and insight into the security concerns and practices pertinent to their industries. This deficiency hinders their ability to integrate security culture into their daily behaviors. In Brazil, home to the most extensive dataset in South America, industries primarily struggle with Responsibilities and Cognition. This suggests that despite acknowledgment of security’s significance, there’s an overarching issue with assuming accountability and comprehending the threats, hindering the implementation of effective security measures.

It’s important to highlight that the sample sizes from various South American countries are small, indicating a general lack of fundamental security measures within numerous organizations. Brazil is notable for having contributed the most substantial sample size in South America.

### Language Localization
Given that Spanish and Portuguese are the most widely spoken languages in South America, most training and awareness providers offer a substantial amount of cybersecurity awareness and training content in these languages. This strategy will help make the material relevant and relatable for users, fostering better engagement and learning outcomes.

### AI Influences
Efforts to nurture talent are fundamental for a flourishing AI ecosystem in South America, and this is complemented by the development of robust regulatory frameworks that ensure the responsible use and progress of AI. Research suggests that the momentum for AI adoption in the region will be fueled by the overarching imperative for companies to undergo digital transformation. Additionally, the benefits derived from enhanced computational power and increased resilience to unexpected market fluctuations will catalyze this growth. On the public sector front, AI presents an unprecedented opportunity for South American governments to address and rectify deep-seated challenges and inefficiencies that have historically impeded the region’s social and economic advancement.

### Key Takeaways
The cybersecurity threat landscape in South America is troubling, and projections indicate a worsening trend. To bolster defenses against the rise of social engineering tactics that have led to unprecedented ransomware attacks, a critical investment in workforce readiness is essential. Businesses must exert stricter diligence in formulating policies and enforcing employee adherence to these guidelines. Furthermore, nations across South America would benefit from improved collaboration on intelligence regarding cyber threats and should actively contribute to a global information-sharing ecosystem. Participation in initiatives such as the Latin American Cybersecurity Research Network is also vital, as it affords deeper insights into evolving threats, as well as access to advanced theories and methodologies in cybersecurity.

## Africa
**By Anna Collard, Senior Vice President of Content Strategy & Evangelist for KnowBe4 Africa**

### Cultural Adoption
With a median employee age of 19 years, Africa’s share of the global workforce is projected to become the largest in the world by 2100. The United Nations projects that by 2050, Africa’s population will reach close to 2.5 billion, meaning that more than 25% of the world’s population will be African. Africa is a region of considerable genetic, linguistic, cultural and economic diversity. With anywhere between 1000 and 2000 languages, Africa is home to approximately one-third of the world’s languages. In total, there are at least 75 languages in Africa with more than one million speakers. This cultural diversity has an impact on technology and cybersecurity adoption, particularly when content is available only in English. In 2023 we collected insights from 147 organizations across 19 African countries.

### General Attitudes
In this region of youth and growth, technology and connectivity usage are rapidly increasing. This digital revolution brings significant potential benefits to economic transformation and job creation, but it also comes with enormous risks and challenges, such as a growing digital divide and increased cyber risks.

Africa has had the most exponential growth in cyber crime over the past few years, particularly among small- and medium-sized organizations. According to Check Point Research, African organizations experienced the highest average number of weekly attacks per organization in the first quarter of 2023. There is a linear relationship between the continent’s GDP and cyber crime; as one increases, so does the other.

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)
In order to address rising cyber crime, some African countries have imposed strict regulatory compliance laws. However, the majority of African countries still lack adequate cybersecurity regulations and enforcement capacities. Currently, only 15 of 55 African countries have ratified the African Union’s Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection.

### Security Events/Prevalent Issues
African organizations face significant cybersecurity challenges, such as a lack of priority by governments, a relatively low level of general cyber awareness, and a lack of IT and cybersecurity skills. 2023 was a difficult year for Sub-Saharan Africa’s economy, with growth slowing to 3.3% from 4% in 2022. The region faces some of the most daunting challenges in the world—including limited resources, urgent humanitarian and development needs, energy crises, poverty and high youth unemployment rates. These challenges may explain a lesser focus on perceived non-business critical tasks such as cybersecurity culture.

### Dimensions
The KnowBe4 Security Culture average score is 72 (same as the prior year) for the assessed organizations from 19 countries across Africa. This finding shows a low-moderate level of security culture, which is aligned with the rest of the global regions. However, there are wide varieties by sectors and by countries. For example, the Kenyan banking sector outperformed all other industry sectors on the continent with an average score of 83 (10 points above the average). African banks and the financial industry have a long history of more mature security cultures. They maintain large SOC and CSERT operations and are a major employer for security professionals. Lower-performing culture scores can be seen in the Public, Construction and Education sectors. The Hospitality sector has also scored on the low end in some countries.

The best-performing African countries in this report are Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana, all which have more mature cybersecurity strategies driven by their local governments. In fact, Ghana’s cybersecurity success has boosted it from 89th place to 43rd on the 2020 International Telecommunications Union’s Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI). It is among just seven African countries in the top 50 GCI globally.

In terms of assessed dimensions, Attitudes, Behaviors, Communication and Norms scored relatively high across all sectors and countries. This could be an indicator of a slight increase in cyber awareness among African employees, driven by corporate security culture programs or an increase in general media coverage. Despite this increased awareness, the low score of Cognition across all sizes shows a lack of real understanding of the threats and impact. We’ve seen this trend mirrored in our locally driven consumer surveys, as well. People seem to be more concerned about the cyber threat—but lack understanding of what, exactly, they are dealing with or how to protect themselves.

### AI Influences
Based on KnowBe4’s 2023 surveys on the adoption of AI on the continent, sentiment toward AI and new technologies is highly positive. Nevertheless, African users are concerned about ethical implications, and 90% believe AI tools should be regulated to ensure responsible use.

In another KnowBe4 2023 generative AI survey across South African security leaders, over one-third (36%) of respondents said their organizations don’t address or regulate the potential misuse of generative AI within their organization. Just over half (58%) of respondents said no specific training is provided about identifying and countering AI-generated misinformation or deepfakes.

### Key Takeaways
The South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) expects an increase in cyber attacks on government departments and critical infrastructure, impacting not just private sector organizations but also societies and national economies.

The majority of African organizations are embracing emerging technologies and embedding them into day-to-day operations. However, not enough is being done yet to regulate use or educate users on risks related to disinformation, security and privacy, as well as ethical concerns, such as bias, inaccuracies and impact on critical thinking. These challenges need to be addressed through a combination of regulation, guidelines and awareness training. Special attention should be given to societal threats posed by malicious use of new technologies, such as deepfakes, especially when used for political manipulation. Major elections coming up in South Africa and other areas of the continent will drive the need for education campaigns. More public-private partnerships are required to assist African people and organizations to build capacity, address the skill shortage, and stay safe in this ever-growing digital world.

## Europe
**By Martin J. Kraemer, Security Awareness Advocate**

### Cultural Adoption
Security culture is understood to varying extents across Europe and its industries. As a concept, it is increasingly being adopted and frequently discussed among security professionals, particularly in sectors with traditionally high levels of digitalization, such as finance, banking and IT. In other industries, security culture is often considered later in the maturity cycle of cybersecurity—slated for attention only after the initial phase of security awareness has been addressed.

While some organizations have a good understanding of security culture as both a process and a strategic measure, many have yet to take their first tactical steps toward achieving that goal. Those that have done so realize that shaping select security behaviors is essential in developing a security culture. These organizations acknowledge that in a proactive security culture, employees have an inherent understanding that secure behavior extends beyond participating in phishing simulations. These employees are intrinsically motivated to add to the security posture of their respective organizations.

However, security culture maturity levels vary greatly across Europe. In some areas, there is little to no recognition for the human element in cybersecurity, necessitating an initial focus on raising awareness. Even though the human factor is still the largest attack vector to any organization, there seems to be a lack of appreciation for that fact—and for the specific attacks that can be launched against individuals.

Europe comprises 44 sovereign countries with a total of 746 million people speaking 287 different languages, 24 of which are recognized as official languages of the European Union.

### General Attitudes
For the most part, organizations across Europe understand that people must be part of the defense of any organization to increase its level of resilience. Security awareness is no longer understood as a checkbox exercise for satisfying compliance requirements. It is increasingly seen as a strategic initiative to foster a security mindset in the organization.

Security is often still considered the responsibility of a single team or unit. In organizations that lack an appreciation for and collaboration on cybersecurity across business departments, security professionals struggle to gain traction. This is evidenced by the relatively small number of Business Information Security Officers (BISOs) hired by organizations. The role of the BISO is of strategic significance toward a more secure future as they build the bridge between security and business.

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)
The EU is a leading force in legislation and regulation, which also drive cybersecurity in the region. Traditionally, legislative efforts are focused on upholding fundamental human rights in times of rapid technological advancements. Like other regions, the EU has also set out to protect businesses from cybersecurity threats through public-private efforts in addition to increasingly tight cybersecurity regulations. These efforts continue to be strong drivers for cybersecurity and data protection in the market.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has had global impact. It is enforceable across the European Union and has inspired similar regulation in other parts of the world. The regulation strikes a balance on data collection and processing that puts individual interests first. Strict cybersecurity requirements are also enforced through sector-specific regulations, such as the Network and Internet Security directive. By October 2024, critical infrastructure organizations must have implemented NIS2—the Network and Information Security directive that holds the board liable for the cybersecurity in their organization. The directive also holds organizations accountable for the security of their supply chains.

The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is coming into force in January 2025 and applies to financial institutions. It requires organizations to demonstrate how quickly they can recover from a cyber attack and to implement employee training.

The EU also regulates the use of AI via a similarly comprehensive approach. A provisional agreement for the EU AI Act was reached in December 2023, but the act won’t come into force until 2025. The AI Act describes a risk-based approach to AI with categories for unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk or minimal risk. Fines can be draconian at 35 million EUR or 3% of gross revenue (whichever is higher).

Organizations may quickly translate new requirements into internal policies, but once these are documented, signed and circulated, they must confront the challenges of cybersecurity governance. It is critical to ensure that organizations and their leaders are unified in their cybersecurity strategies and objectives, with standardized processes, robust enforcement, clear accountability and oversight from senior leaders, along with the necessary resources. To truly strengthen their cybersecurity posture, organizations must implement comprehensive governance. Otherwise, compliance will be nothing more than a checkbox exercise.

### Security Events/Prevalent Issues
The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) reports an increase in quality and quantity of cyber attacks and their consequences, a surge in ransomware attacks for 2023, and influences from the Russia/Ukraine conflict. The top three threats were ransomware, malware and social engineering. 2023 also saw an increase in professionalization of as-a-service cyber crime offerings, with diversifying tactics and methods fueling alternative ways to infiltrate victims and extort money. Social engineering grew considerably, with phishing remaining the top attack vector while attacks also increased in the physical world.

As highlighted by the Russian war in Ukraine, misinformation and disinformation are on the rise again. Due to upcoming elections in 2024 and the availability of generative AI tools, the quantity and quality of disinformation will continue to pose a threat to society. Generative AI also paves the way for cheap fakes and voice phishing, both of which are increasing threats to private organizations and have been used successfully to extort money.

The MOVEit breach affected insurances, banks and account-switching services across Europe. More than 100 organizations have been affected by the breach that originated from a zero-day vulnerability in the file-sharing service. While the breach has resulted in the SEC tightening reporting guidelines in the U.S., in Europe credit score agencies such as Experian advised customers to freeze credit scores and banks disclosed the leak of customer data including account numbers.

The Clop gang’s extortion scheme has also led to further consideration of insurance coverage and payout conditions. Conventionally, ransomware gangs extorted money by encrypting data. The Clop gang demands payment based on the threat of publishing data. However, insurers will not be able to pay out for the purpose of hiding a data breach from authorities. For the actual reporting requirement, this is irrelevant since the breach happened as soon as the gang downloaded the data. Still, reputational damage from a data leak can be significant.

### Dimensions

**Europe vs. Worldwide**

| Organizational Size | Region | Attitudes | Behaviors | Cognition | Communication | Compliance | Norms | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Large** | Europe | 75 | 75 | 68 | 72 | 73 | 73 | 69 |
| | Difference | -1 | 2 | -1 | -1 | -2 | -1 | 0 |
| **Medium** | Europe | 75 | 77 | 69 | 74 | 73 | 74 | 69 |
| | Difference | -1 | 0 | -1 | -1 | -2 | -1 | 1 |
| **Small** | Europe | 75 | 75 | 71 | 77 | 73 | 74 | 71 |
| | Difference | 0 | 2 | -1 | -1 | -1 | 0 | 0 |

Our 2023 European data set was collected from a total of 673 organizations and 162,688 individuals. The overall security culture score for Europe stands at low-moderate 73, unchanged from prior year.

In Europe, it still holds true that the smaller the organization, the higher the security culture score. Smaller organizations benefit from more personal and efficient communication. Communication channels are perceived as better, and there is a stronger sense of belonging and more support for security issues. Relatedly, Cognition and Compliance are also better.

Among European respondents, there is less understanding of security policies and the extent to which employees are meant to follow them (the Compliance dimension). Similarly, there is less understanding, knowledge and awareness of security issues and activities (the Cognition dimension). It seems possible that the best way to influence these dimensions might be to improve Communication, which is also lacking in Europe. Setting up better communication channels and fostering more open and direct communication can help.

Interestingly, the behavior of people in Europe is reported as more secure in medium and small organizations than the worldwide average. Employees are more likely to act directly or indirectly in ways that improve the security of their organization. Increased legislation and governance, the ensuing threat of the Russia/Ukraine war, and local governments’ increased investment in cybersecurity and awareness efforts all contribute to this.

### Language Localization
Language localization remains a major factor in Europe, where more than 200 languages are spoken. Moreover, European and national-level legislation posit specific compliance and legal requirements. Localization beyond simple translation and implementation of specific requirements is also necessary. Present cultural differences across the continent do make a difference in human-focused efforts.

### AI Influences
We can report similar influences of AI in Europe as in the rest of the world. The cybersecurity threat landscape evolves with phishing attacks gaining in quantity and quality. Misinformation and disinformation will also be fueled by generative AI, which ENISA already considers a cybersecurity threat. Misinformation campaigns are often used as precursors for other attacks.

And while still relatively uncommon, the possible threat from AI-driven cyber attacks, such as deepfake-augmented phishing or vishing attacks, could account for the increased focus on security awareness and security culture in the region. The accessibility of AI technology, such as generative AI, opens avenues for an unprecedented increase in sophistication and effectiveness of attacks. This warrants the attention of all organizations and is a justifiably hot topic.

AI also continues to affect businesses. In a traditionally compliance-driven region, the uncertainties of AI’s impact on the workforce and the nature of work as well as far-reaching ethical considerations are likely to slow adoption. While the EU AI Act is supposed to provide a framework and legal surety, it is controversial even before coming into effect. Legal and regulatory guardrails normally result in a slower, more purposeful adoption of new technologies. That said, very few businesses will continue to resist the promises of increases in productivity long term.

### Key Takeaways
Smaller European organizations score higher in security culture due to more effective personal communication, stronger community bonds and better support for security issues. This leads to enhanced Cognition and Compliance, with improvements in communication channels posited as a key driver for better security policy understanding and proactive security behaviors that outperform global averages.

Security culture in Europe exhibits significant variation in understanding and adoption across industries, with a general trend toward increased awareness in highly digitized sectors. However, many organizations have yet to make substantial strides in developing a proactive security culture. European organizations are recognizing the strategic importance of integrating security awareness into their corporate culture to enhance resilience. However, challenges persist where cybersecurity is not yet viewed as a cross-departmental responsibility.

The EU is at the forefront of shaping global cybersecurity standards through robust legislation and regulations like the GDPR, sector-specific directives such as NIS2, and upcoming comprehensive policies including DORA and the EU AI Act. ENISA identifies a notable escalation in cyber attacks during 2023, with ransomware, malware and social engineering as top threats. These are exacerbated by professional as-a-service cyber crime offerings and physical attacks.

Generative AI-driven misinformation is becoming a growing concern, while significant breaches like MOVEit and Clop gang’s extortion tactics are influencing cybersecurity reporting regulations, credit security measures and insurance industry responses to ransomware and data leaks.

In Europe, the diversity of 24 official languages and distinct legislative frameworks necessitate meticulous language localization and culturally nuanced compliance strategies to effectively address the varied human-centric aspects of cybersecurity efforts across the continent.

AI’s influence on Europe echoes global trends with a rise in sophisticated phishing and use of generative AI for misinformation now recognized as a cybersecurity threat by ENISA. This compliance-centric market and its caution around AI’s ethical implications and workforce impact could slow adoption even as businesses ultimately seek the productivity gains AI promises.

## Asia
**By Martin J. Kraemer, Security Awareness Advocate**

### Cultural Adoption
The Security Culture Report encompasses data from 27 diverse nations across five distinct areas and reveals significant disparities in security culture scores. Notably, the Middle East and East Asia exhibit a higher degree of maturity in their security cultures compared to their counterparts in Central, South and Southeast Asia.

| Region | Avg. Security Culture Score | Number of Organizations |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Central Asia | 66 | 1 |
| East Asia | 74 | 22 |
| Middle East | 74 | 51 |
| South Asia | 68 | 19 |
| Southeast Asia | 68 | 64 |
| **Grand Total** | **71** | **157** |

This variance highlights the presence of countries within the region whose security practices are comparable to those of European nations. However, there exists a notable gap in legislation, technical and organizational maturity when compared to European and North American standards. The cybersecurity infrastructure in several of these nations is underdeveloped. Socioeconomic disparities among these countries likely influence their security culture scores. Investments in the social and cultural dimensions of security could enhance their overall security stance, as indicated by research findings.

The analysis reveals that only a few countries and industries within this region meet the global average, pointing to a widespread lack of awareness and appreciation for the importance of security culture. Consequently, organizations within these nations may find it necessary to significantly invest in enhancing internal awareness and advocating for collaborative efforts to improve the country’s security posture. Specifically, nations in South and Southeast Asia are encouraged to prioritize the establishment of programmatic awareness initiatives as a precursor to fostering security-conscious behaviors.

With 48 sovereign countries, Asia is home to 4.6 billion individuals who speak over 2,300 distinct languages. Mandarin, Hindi, Indonesian, Bengali and Japanese are among the most prevalent. This linguistic and cultural diversity further complicates the challenge of establishing a unified security culture across the continent, underscoring the importance of tailored and inclusive approaches to cybersecurity education and awareness.

### General Attitudes
Attitudes toward cultural adoption and cybersecurity differ from one country to another, influenced by each country’s laws and regulations. All countries, without exception, are impacted by cyber crime. This impact correlates to the number and size of organizations that exist within each country.

In Asia, high-context communication styles prevail. Direct messages often fail to resonate because they do not align with local cultural expectations. Those specializing in raising cybersecurity awareness need to tailor their strategies: effective communication must be not only clear and direct but also convey the right tone, style and context.

Asian cultures tend to have a more pronounced sense of social norms and hierarchies than European or North American cultures. Leveraging these norms and structures could help alter the prevalent organizational mindset regarding cybersecurity. Currently, cybersecurity is often viewed as solely a concern for IT departments. It’s essential for professionals in the field to help shift this perception toward cybersecurity as everyone’s responsibility.

### Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)
Regulatory requirements are usually driven by cohesive cybersecurity strategies. However, many countries in the region are yet to develop their own vision for cybersecurity. As such, the regulatory landscape is fragmented, and there is no effort to create unified cybersecurity standards across the area.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) released their 2021-2025 ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy, which provides a “roadmap for regional cooperation to achieve the objective of a safe and security ASEAN cyberspace.” ASEAN includes the member states of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Singapore’s Cybersecurity Act has been in force since 2018, and on December 15, 2023, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) published a consultation paper on a draft Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill).

Regulatory requirements in the regions are challenging. India forces organizations to report data breaches within six hours from the moment of discovery. Naturally, this requirement is criticized as impractical by experts. Criminal charges and hefty fines are waiting should this requirement not be met. Other countries in the region have introduced legislation to enforce local data storage.

The regulatory landscape in the region will stay very fragmented for the foreseeable future. Organizations doing business in the region must therefore be prepared to adhere to ever-evolving country-specific legislation. Staying up to date with that legislation becomes a major task for professionals.

### Security Events/Prevalent Issues
Cybersecurity challenges such as ransomware, data breaches, and AI-enhanced threats are common globally, including in Asia. These problems have led to calls for updated reporting laws and new regulations throughout the region. Notably, Singapore saw a sharp increase in QR code phishing scams in 2023, and this trend is expected to persist into 2024.

The Allianz Commercial Risk Barometer for 2024 identifies cyber risk as the primary concern for businesses in the Asia Pacific region, with malware, ransomware, and social engineering attacks being the most common attack strategies. Criminals often use emails, websites and social media for these deceptive attacks.

Reports highlight that Asia is facing a particularly high surge in cyber attacks compared to other regions, making it a prime target for cybercriminals. This surge is attributed to the region’s rapid digital growth, strong manufacturing sector, and burgeoning population of new tech users. To combat this, there is a dire need for more investment in national cybersecurity policies and the formation of dedicated cyber task forces. In addition, enhancing education and training on this front is becoming increasingly urgent.

### Dimensions

**Asia vs. Global Overview**

| Organizational size | Region | Attitudes | Behaviors | Cognition | Communication | Compliance | Norms | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Large** | Asia | 75 | 75 | 76 | 76 | 74 | 72 | 68 |
| | Difference | 0 | 0 | 1 | -1 | -1 | -3 | 0 |
| **Medium** | Asia | 70 | 70 | 71 | 71 | 75 | 76 | 70 |
| | Difference | 1 | -1 | -1 | 1 | -1 | -3 | -2 |
| **Small** | Asia | 71 | 75 | 74 | 75 | 70 | 69 | 70 |
| | Difference | -2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | -1 |

Organizations in Asia generally exhibit lower cybersecurity behavior scores regardless of size, and they also tend to score lower on Compliance measures. This trend may translate into a weaker overall cybersecurity stance, with employees being less inclined to follow security guidelines or to act in a secure manner. However, Asia is known for its strong social traditions, which is likely why the region performs better when it comes to social norm-related aspects of security. Security professionals should prioritize establishing robust security policies and collaborate with different departments to foster positive norms that encourage secure behavior.

We can also see that the leading industries with security culture scores over 73 are highly regulated. They are Government (74), Energy and Utilities (74), Banking (74), Manufacturing (73) and Financial Services (73). At the other end of the spectrum, industries with low security culture scores include Construction and Legal (68 for both) and Education (69). These industries would be advised to focus on areas of improvement within the security culture dimensions if they are to make a positive impact moving forward.

### Language Localization
With around 2,300 languages spoken by 4.46 billion people across Asia, language localization is critically important to uptake and engagement of both organizations and employees. This brings challenges in ensuring not only the availability of local languages, but also in addressing nuances and cultural differences wit

hin
security awareness programs.

In Asia’s high-context cultures, effective
communication goes beyond words. To
convey messages about cybersecurity
successfully, one must consider
communication style, tone and language
nuances. Messages should be rich in
context and not purely straightforward or
blunt, as this approach resonates better
within the region. Moreover, since Asian
cultures often value hierarchy, a top-
down communication approach may be
appropriate and effective. It’s vital to be
mindful of cultural nuances when trying to
influence security practices and attitudes.

AI Influences
Like all technologies, AI presents both
great opportunities and threats regarding
cybersecurity. AI isn’t new. What is new is
the advancement of deepfake technologies
and large language learning models,
such as ChatGPT, with the addition of
voice, image and video generation. These
new advancements introduce additional
potential red flags. Cybercriminals are still
focusing on attaining the human emotional
response with social engineering.

Organizations and individuals are concerned
with AI and how it has added a new strain
of cyber crime, which has devastating
effects. Calls continue for more regulation
and legislation in this space to protect the
region from AI. Released in January 2024,
The Engaging with Artificial Intelligence
(AI) report is a collaboration among 13
international organizations, including the
Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA)
and other Asia-based organizations.

Key Takeaways
The many countries across Asia require a
collaborative approach to cybersecurity.
There is a large disparity between the
Middle East and East Asia and other
parts of the region. This is largely due to
socioeconomic differences in the countries.
While some countries are already working
together, there is an opportunity for greater
success with additional collaboration
and resource sharing if the region is to
increase its cybersecurity awareness and
strengthen its overall security culture.

Oceania (Australia, New Zealand
and Papua New Guinea)

By Martin J. Kraemer, Security Awareness Advocate

Cultural Adoption
Security culture has increased year over year as a topic of interest in the region with a
welcome addition of business units outside of IT, such as HR, at the table. IT acknowledges
the requirement for change management principles aligned with cybersecurity
strategy to engage employees’ hearts and minds. Over the past 12 months, we have
also seen an increased demand and understanding of cybersecurity at the board
level, with cybersecurity now accepted as a business risk rather than an IT risk.

Developments like these illustrate that Australia and New Zealand are making
important strides toward maturing cybersecurity culture overall. The Oceania Cyber
Security Center has determined that the technological abilities of the region far exceed
the human capabilities in 2021. Subsequent  initiatives have improved the situation,
but as the security culture score shows, the region still has catching up to do.

Australia and New Zealand are the most developed economies in the region, and
they show the best security scores. For reference, the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index
ranking from 2020 places Australia 15th, New Zealand 32nd and Papua New Guinea
149th. The region includes 14 independent countries and several overseas territories.
It is estimated that people in the region speak more than 1,200 languages. Our dataset
includes organizations in Australia (133), New Zealand (29) and Papua New Guinea (3).

REGIOnaL REPORTs

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024General Attitudes
As a result of significant data breaches in the region, the line between work and personal
cybersecurity has blurred. Most citizens have experienced a breach of their Personally
Identifiable Information. Scams, breaches, and ransomware have become daily occurrences
across all media platforms, normalizing the topic. The Australian government continues to
raise awareness through campaigns, such as “Stay Smart Online” or “Get Cyber Smart.”

Social engineering and phishing attacks are the most common threats, highlighting
the need for continued training and increased awareness. Calls for stronger defense
mechanisms are also fueled by the continued threat of ransomware attacks on
businesses and critical infrastructure. There are efforts to combat that threat through
public-private collaboration between businesses and government bodies.

Key Regulatory Requirements (i.e., Legislative)
Australia and New Zealand have updated and implemented new regulatory requirements
in 2023. The 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy was released in late 2023. The
strategy is intended as a roadmap to help realize the Australian government’s vision of
becoming a world leader in cybersecurity by 2030. In addition, a mandatory data breach
notification scheme is a hot topic across Australia. In August, New Zealand released its
National Security Strategy 2023-2028, which is an extension of its 2019 Cyber Security Strategy.

Both strategies are
set to transform the
cybersecurity landscape
significantly by motivating
organizations to boost
their efforts in becoming
more cyber resilient.
These strategies draw
parallels with the U.S.
approach by promoting
collaboration between
the public and private
sectors for enhanced
defense and positioning
major businesses
at the forefront of
Australia’s cyber defense
initiatives. Additionally,
organizations are now
subject to mandatory
reporting obligations
and should anticipate
further regulatory updates shortly. The goal is to elevate Australia’s
cybersecurity readiness to meet robust international standards.

REGIOnaL REPORTs

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Security Events/
Prevalent Issues
In 2023, the Oceania region witnessed several
high-profile data breaches, significantly
impacting its citizens, sometimes repeatedly,
and leading to class-action lawsuits. For
instance, in March 2023, Latitude Financial
reported a massive data breach involving
12 million customer records in Australia
and New Zealand, exposing sensitive
details like driver’s license and passport
numbers. This incident was one of the
largest in recent times. Following closely, the
telecommunications giant Optus experienced
a breach affecting 9.8 million customers, and
Medibank’s breach compromised 9.7 million
health records and personal information.

These incidents, alongside the growing
use of ransomware, data breaches and the
advanced capabilities of generative AI, are
major concerns for IT professionals in the
region. These challenges underscore the
urgent need to reassess and update current
data breach reporting laws and the Privacy
Act. Moreover, the emergence of generative
AI has sparked a call for new rules and laws
to protect organizations and individuals alike.

Dimensions
The KnowBe4 security culture average score
of 71 for the assessed organizations from
three countries across Oceania shows a
moderate level of security culture aligned
with the rest of the global regions.

As we focus on the specific sectors across
Oceania, not surprisingly, Technology is
leading the way with a security score of
77, above the regional average. Alarmingly,
there are six sectors scoring 70 or under:
Government (70), Construction (70), Banking
(70), Energy and Utilities (69), Education (69),
and Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals (67).

The dimension of Cognition is low in both
Australia (69) and New Zealand (67), which
may indicate a lack of ongoing training that
would otherwise increase understanding,
knowledge and awareness. Overall, the
region falls behind the global average,
indicating a potential to mature security
culture across organizations. Our insights are
in line with the ITU’s Global Cybersecurity
Index and similar reports that highlight
needs for development of cybersecurity
capabilities in Australia and New Zealand
as the most developed countries.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024There is a call for more regulation and
legislation in this space to protect the
region from AI-related threats and misuse.
The Australian Government published
its interim response to supporting
responsible AI on January 17, 2024.

The Engaging with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
report was released in January 2024 and is
a collaboration between 13 international
organizations, including New Zealand’s
CERT NZ, the National Cyber Security
Centre, the Australian Signals Directorate
and the Australian Cyber Security Centre.

Key Takeaways
Conversations about security culture are
attracting the attention the topic deserves
across organizations, and we have seen
a resulting increase in best-practice
security awareness training programs.
These programs are influencing other
organizations to reexamine their programs
and make appropriate adjustments.

As more citizens in the region fall
victim to cyber incidents, demand for
legislation, regulations, data protection,
privacy and knowledge increases.

AI has certainly added complexity
to cyber crime. Individuals need
additional understanding to keep it
in perspective while adding relevant
red flags to their awareness bank.

Language Localization
Adapting content to local language and
culture is crucial in Australia and New
Zealand, especially in Communication-
related areas such as cybersecurity
training. For instance, even the spelling
differences between “localization” and
“localisation” highlight the importance of
using a genuine Australian or New Zealand
voice in training materials. Recognizing such
regional nuances can significantly enhance
acceptance and appreciation. Tailoring the
cybersecurity message with local language
adaptations leads to better employee
engagement and commitment, key factors
in developing a strong security culture.

Moreover, the Oceania region is
incredibly diverse in terms of language
and culture. Australia, while primarily
English-speaking, is home to numerous
indigenous languages and languages
brought by immigrants. New Zealand
recognizes five official languages, along
with several indigenous languages. Papua
New Guinea stands out with a staggering
800 indigenous languages alongside
English and Tok Pisin as official languages.
This rich cultural tapestry underscores
the need for inclusivity and sensitivity in
training materials to ensure they resonate
across this varied linguistic landscape.

AI Influences
Organizations and individuals across the
region are concerned with AI and how it has
added a new avenue for cyber crime with
potentially devastating effects. While there
is no argument that AI can also have positive
effects on all areas of life, it comes with a
quick introduction of deepfakes in images,
voice and video adding complexity to existing
social engineering red flags. With these
advancements, the increase of the emotional
human response needs to be addressed.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Banking

The Banking sector recognizes risk management principles due to the high stakes
involved with financial data. Mandated cybersecurity standards and employee training
protocols contribute significantly to this sector’s comprehensive risk management
strategy. It has achieved an improved security culture score of mid moderate 76
compared to the previous year, a testimony to consistent effort over time.

Benchmarked with the previous year’s employee survey results, minor shifts have been
observed in some dimensions. The Norms dimension, with a two-point rise to 76 from the
last measurement period, indicates a subtle shift in overall security culture considerations.

The financial sector, unfortunately, bears the brunt of any successful breach, not
only financially but also in terms of trust, with an institution’s reputation often
tainted among its customers and the broader public. Ransomware, a threatening
type of malware, is the primary driver of these high-impact digital incidents.

In January 2023, an industry consortium warned about the rising prevalence
of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The consortium called
for increased vigilance among banks and credit unions to prevent these
already disruptive attacks from becoming a regular occurrence.

A researcher observed that the landscape of cyber threats evolved in 2023. Banking
trojans, ransomware and deceptive finance apps designed for data theft have been the
tools of choice for cybercriminals. According to a survey carried out by the researcher, 60%
of institutions confirmed falling victim to destructive attacks within the year, while 64%
experienced a surge in application attacks. Software development, integration and delivery
infrastructures are facing an increasing threat from adversaries targeting supply chains.

IndUsTRy bEnChMaRk

Areas for Improvement
Despite steady ratings on Attitudes, Communication and Responsibilities (78, 75, and 72,
respectively), Cognition continues to be the lowest-scoring dimension at low moderate 70.
A particular focus on enhancing Cognition and Responsibilities within the Banking sector’s
security culture could be beneficial, especially with the ever-looming threat of ransomware.

IndUsTRy bEnChMaRk

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Business Services

The Business Services sector, encompassing a diverse array of professions
from recruitment and physical security to office management and sanitation,
underscores the universal risk of cyber attacks no industry can ignore.

Despite a slight dip in the security culture score to a mid moderate 73, the sector’s
risk level has held steady over the past half-decade at a low moderate range.
Vulnerabilities arise from minimal security protocols, outdated IT systems, and a
tendency to acquiesce to ransom demands for customer data recovery. Cybercriminals
capitalize on these weaknesses, aware of the sector’s often insufficient understanding
of their vendors’ security measures. Additionally, the sector’s reliance on a remote
workforce, relationship-driven operations, and challenges in establishing continuous
training and awareness heightens its appeal as a target for cyber threats.

In this year’s Security Culture Index, the dimensions of Behaviors (76) and Attitudes (75)
maintain a mid-moderate standing, indicating that employees generally make secure choices
and demonstrate a readiness to adopt behaviors that positively influence organizational
security. However, the areas of Cognition (70) and Responsibilities (70) reveal a gap: while
there’s a willingness to enhance security, there’s an apparent shortfall in understanding
effective implementation. This disconnect has significant implications, as highlighted by
alarming developments in data security. Security Discovery and CyberNews researchers
have uncovered a staggering database breach, involving over 26 billion compromised
records, including information from LinkedIn, a key platform for professional recruitment.

IndUsTRy bEnChMaRk

Areas for Improvement
The Business Services sector stands to gain significantly by bolstering its dedication
to ongoing, holistic training and education programs. Enhancing employees’
understanding of security will not only improve Cognition scores but also positively
affect their perception of personal responsibility in safeguarding the organization.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Construction

In the Construction industry, there has been a significant shift away from conventional
business methods toward adopting advanced technologies for collaboration, supply chain
management and assessment of on-site work and progress. However, this accelerated
integration of technology brings with it the need for greater comprehension of associated
risk factors, particularly exposure to cybersecurity threats. Alongside these advancements,
the industry faces a persistent labor shortage and high employee turnover that hinders
the development of strong personal cybersecurity practices. That leaves the door open
for potential cyber incidents. Despite a marginal improvement in the security culture
score this year to a barely sufficient low moderate 71, the sector is close to descending
into a range indicative of lackluster performance, a trend observed over multiple years.

Intriguingly, in the realm of security culture dimensions, Behaviors and Communication
have obtained a score of 73, which is somewhat satisfactory. However, the dimensions of
Cognition and Responsibilities, scoring 66 and 67 respectively, are considered mediocre.
This disparity highlights a gap where employees receive adequate information but fail to
interpret and apply it, leading to a lapse in recognizing their individual roles in maintaining
cybersecurity in both their professional and private spheres. As the pace of business quickens
and AI becomes more sophisticated, the risk of cyber attacks intensifies. For the construction
industry, with its stringent deadlines, high transaction volumes and thin profit margins, any
disruption due to a cyber attack can be immensely detrimental, as evidenced by the cyber
attack on Simpson Manufacturing in Q4 of 2023. The attack forced a system shutdown and
indicates the possibility of a ransomware attack, though specific details were not disclosed.

IndUsTRy bEnChMaRk

Areas for Improvement
To address these emerging technological realities, construction businesses must
prioritize compliance with data regulations and privacy laws to safeguard their intellectual
property and client data. They must establish a stronger link between personnel
training, cybersecurity awareness and the cultivation of a security-conscious culture.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Consulting

The Consulting industry has seen security culture scores remain constant at a mid
moderate 75 over the past two years, which signals a period of stagnation. The foundation
of a consulting firm’s success is the trust placed in it by clients; any breach in that trust
can result in severe harm to the firm’s reputation and lead to a tangible loss in both
existing and potential clientele. By their very nature, consulting entities handle copious
amounts of sensitive data, balancing high expectations for confidentiality against
the demands of a fast-paced and often stressful work setting. Since they possess
valuable client intellectual property as well as vast amounts of sensitive personal
and financial information, they present an attractive target for cybercriminals.

On the Security Culture Index, the Consulting sector demonstrates fairly acceptable
scores of 76 in Attitudes, Behaviors and Communication, yet it underperforms with a
score of 70 in Responsibilities and a somewhat better 72 in Cognition. This suggests
that while conversions with security policies and the perception of individual impact on
organizational security are present, there is a struggle to engage with wider industry-
specific security challenges and to put into practice effective protection and defensive
measures. Put simply, while these employees grasp the concept of security, translating
that understanding into concrete actions remains an issue. The pressure from cyber
threats is anticipated to mount for consulting firms, as exemplified by a reported
global ransomware attack that impacted leading firms like PwC and EY, as covered by
the Financial Review. Such incidents confirm the growing cyber risks in the sector.

Amid progress in AI technology, which is not expected to replace consultants
but to augment their capacity to handle increased workloads, the industry
must grapple with the pressures of intensified demand alongside diminished
resources. These dynamics could exacerbate employee burnout.

Areas for Improvement
For improvement, consulting firms—particularly large ones offering cybersecurity
services—must embody the very security practices they advocate to clients. Leadership
should exemplify the desired security behaviors, and by leveraging security champion
programs, firms can foster better alignment of security messaging with staff needs
to ensure local support and relevance. Mere directives from the top are insufficient
in such an environment; instead, leadership should actively demonstrate the
significance of nurturing a security-minded culture through actions, not just words.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Consumer Services

The Consumer Services sector’s approach to cybersecurity remains modest, with its
security culture score dipping slightly to 71 from the previous year, reflecting a low
moderate standing. This sector, which spans a broad range of industries such as travel,
food and beverage, media and leisure, directly services consumers and encompasses
a variety of occupations, including customer service representatives, cleaners, delivery
drivers and facilities managers. When assessing the risk landscape, one could compare
the challenges of executing a bank heist against exploiting individual consumer accounts;
while a bank may offer a larger bounty, it is heavily fortified, whereas individual
accounts, though yielding smaller gains, are typically less secure and, therefore, more
susceptible to cyber attacks. This inherent vulnerability in consumer-facing systems
makes organizations within this sector particularly enticing to cybercriminals.

On the Security Culture Index, the areas of Attitudes, Behaviors and Communication score
reasonably yet on the lower moderate side for the Consumer Services sector. However,
Cognition and Responsibilities are notably deficient and rated as mediocre, corresponding to
the Consulting sector’s shortcomings. Despite frequent communication on security from their
organizations and a belief among employees that they play a role in safeguarding company
security, there is a discernible gap in comprehending the wider security issues relevant
to their roles and industry, as well as devising effective protective strategies. Employees
know the importance of security, but they often lack clarity on their precise role and the
actions they can take. They may unintentionally become the weak link that initiates a cyber
threat, as illustrated by the September 2023 cyber attack on the travel booking company
Sabre, where hackers claimed to have pilfered extensive amounts of sensitive data.

IndUsTRy bEnChMaRk

Areas for Improvement
For the Consumer Services sector to
fortify its defenses in an era increasingly
defined by AI’s influence on consumer
behavior, priority should be given to:

1. Elevating the security awareness of
employees through comprehensive
training programs that blend educational
content, simulations and consistent
communication, empowering them to
identify and report suspicious activities.

2. Strengthening internal protective
measures by investing in advanced
technological solutions, such as upgrading
customer relationship management
systems, tightening third-party access
controls and mandating encryption and
multi-factor authentication measures.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Education

With the Education sector’s growing dependency on digital learning environments and
online resources, incidence of cyber threats has surged, making the protection of vast
holdings of confidential data a pressing concern. Education entities, ripe with sensitive
student and staff information, are prime targets for data breaches and phishing schemes.
Despite an uplift from 68 (high mediocre) to 70 (low moderate) in their security culture
score year over year, educational institutions still linger at the lower end in industry
comparisons. The Compliance dimension saw an uptick by four points to 70, and Norms
improved slightly by two points, indicating positive change. Nevertheless, the Responsibilities
metric, having stayed low at 66 for consecutive years, reveals an ample opportunity for
further progress. During 2023, schools, particularly at the K-12 level, were confronted by
a wave of cyber attacks, with nearly 29% exploiting system vulnerabilities and about 30%
instigated through phishing efforts. A notable incident was the MOVEit data breach, which
compromised the records of approximately 900 schools and sensitive data pertaining to
over 51,000 individuals, ranging from personal identification to educational details.

Additionally, the emergence of generative AI has become a focal point in the
educational landscape. It’s imperative for institutions to consider the effects of
these tools on student learning and to communicate the ethical consequences
connected to academic misconduct, including cheating and plagiarism. Various
schools have already developed rules and guidelines aimed at preventing misuse of
such tools while endorsing appropriate use to bolster research and learning.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Energy & Utilities

The Energy & Utilities sector, with its intricate interconnection between physical and
cyber infrastructure, holds a unique position of increased potential vulnerability to
incursions by foreign intelligence entities and cybercriminals. Groups such as the U.S.
Federal Government’s Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) serve as
mechanisms of defense. For example, CRISP’s continuous data collection via information
sharing devices is aimed at identifying malicious actors within the sector. Moreover, an
annual event, the Cyber Security for Energy and Utilities Conference—now in its fifth
year—provides an essential platform for sharing critical information. While numerous
organizations exist to provide this type of support, the industry’s security culture score
has shown a modest increase, standing at 72 (low moderate) in the most recent survey.

According to a report on cyber attacks on Vital infrastructure, a substantial 60% of
these attacks are orchestrated by state-affiliated agents. Furthermore, internal staff
inadvertently enable nearly 33% of these attacks. The energy sector is a primary
target for threat actors, attracting 39% of attacks, a figure more than triple the attack
volume in other sectors like critical manufacturing (11%) and transportation (10%). This
research also underscores the urgency to bolster IT system security as a key strategy
for countering cyber attacks on critical infrastructure and manufacturing facilities.

Indeed, over 80% of Operational Technology (OT)/Industrial Control System (ICS)
incidents analyzed were triggered by a compromise of an IT system. The report
attributes this predominance of IT system compromise to the escalating interconnectivity
between IT and OT frameworks and applications. Phishing remains the primary
mode of attack, accounting for 34% of methods used. This finding highlights the
pressing need for robust cybersecurity measures such as segmentation, air gapping,
zero trust and security awareness training to curtail risk. Although over 80% of
threat actors originate from outside the organization, insiders who unintentionally
fulfill a facilitative role feature in approximately one-third of incidents.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Financial Services

Investors and lenders are approaching their operations with heightened caution,
leveraging technological advances to mitigate risks, optimize expenses and enhance
productivity—all while prioritizing a seamless customer and employee experience. These
dynamics significantly influence the emerging trends in Financial Services for 2023. The
overall security culture score had a one-point drop to a mid moderate 75. However, the
landscape is becoming increasingly challenging due to weakening economic output,
rising interest rates, and heightened international political tensions, amplifying difficulties
for banks, insurers and fund managers. The outlook for new financial challengers,
including fintech and cryptocurrency entities, appears to be even more formidable.

Financial institutions face a substantial threat from cyber attacks, with an average loss
of approximately $5.9 million per data breach, surpassing the global average by 28%.
Regulatory concerns further shape how financial companies respond to these threats
and allocate resources to reduce overall risk. While 48% of financial attacks originate
from malicious actors, human error accounts for 33%. The primary attack vectors
include phishing (16%) and compromised credentials (15%). Successful breaches often
grant attackers access to millions of transaction and client records, with the average
cost for breaches that involve at least 50 million records exceeding $300 million. Despite
these challenges, there is positive news. Finance organizations demonstrate a proactive
approach in detecting and containing data breaches, surpassing global averages. While
companies worldwide take 204 days to identify and 73 days to contain a breach, the
financial industry achieves these milestones in 177 and 56 days, respectively. In 2023,
39% of financial organizations reported extensive use of security AI and automation,
reflecting a commitment to swiftly and effectively addressing cybersecurity risks.

IndUsTRy bEnChMaRk

Areas for Improvement
Industry reports have brought to light the
ongoing vulnerability of the financial services
sector to phishing attacks, underlining the
critical need for stronger cybersecurity

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Government

In March 2023, the U.S. Federal Government unveiled its National Cybersecurity Strategy,
charting a comprehensive course toward bolstering the nation’s cyber defenses. Central to
this strategy are two key objectives: requiring major public and private entities to shoulder
a larger portion of cyber risk mitigation and reshaping the economic landscape to better
reward long-term commitments to cybersecurity. This forward-looking strategy is structured
around five synergistic pillars aimed at fortifying critical infrastructure, neutralizing cyber
adversaries, incentivizing market-driven security enhancements, investing in future-proof
digital systems, and cultivating international alliances for cooperative cyber defense.

While the strategy sets an aspirational roadmap for a more secure cyberspace, the
accompanying implementation details vital for a full appraisal of the plan’s feasibility—such
as agency responsibilities, legislative needs and initiative leadership—were not disclosed
alongside the National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS). Adding to the urgency for detailed
action plans, the strategy’s release comes at a time when the sector continues to face
challenges, as reflected in an underwhelming security culture score of a low moderate 70. This
underscores the crucial need for precise, actionable measures to effectively operationalize
the strategy’s five pillars and ensure a robust cyber posture for the United States.

Cyber threats to governmental infrastructure, fueled by nation-state actors and profit-seeking
hackers, continued to pose critical challenges in 2023, as underscored by several high-profile
incidents. Notably, Microsoft unearthed a Chinese cyber-espionage operation, attributed to the
Storm-0558 group, which had infiltrated customer email accounts since May 15, 2023. Targets
included personnel within the U.S. State and Commerce Departments along with other federal
entities, hinting at a deeply concerning security lapse. This breach came to light after attackers
successfully seized control of a Microsoft engineer’s work account, which precipitated severe
criticism and allegations of carelessness from a U.S. legislator directed toward the corporation.
Further, in a troubling revelation in August 2023, The UK’s Electoral Commission announced it
had fallen prey to a “sophisticated cyber-attack.” The incident compromised personal details of
the UK’s electorate registered from 2014 to 2022. The intricacies of the attack, coupled with the
fact that the culprits evaded detection for an extensive 15 months, pointed toward objectives
that likely extended beyond immediate financial exploitation. This breach’s severity was later
compounded by reports that the Electoral Commission had suffered an automatic failure in a
Cyber Essentials assessment, reflecting significant vulnerabilities in its security framework.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals

The Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals sector has become increasingly aware of the importance
of security culture due to the sensitivity of personal information and the presence of legal
requirements such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The industry
has responded to the need to protect sensitive information with continued adoption of
telehealth and remote patient monitoring. However, this shift has also increased the need
for the sector to be extra vigilant against cyber threats. Bad actors have capitalized on this
opportunity and have begun to target remote workers as employees accessed corporate
networks through personal devices. The Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals sector has a deep
understanding of risk management, and this knowledge has helped employees respond
to these new threats with mixed results. Overall, the sector has remained consistent
in its performance with a score of low moderate 73, matching last year’s results.

The IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023 shows that the healthcare and pharmaceutical
industries are among the most affected by data breaches, with these two sectors facing
the highest average cost. This year has seen significant attacks on American healthcare
organizations, with several prominent ransomware attacks making headlines. Notable
examples include the data breach affecting 11 million patients at the for-profit HCA Healthcare,
as well as the ransomware attack on Ardent Health Services, which led to the diversion of
services at several hospitals. These health systems and hospitals have also been victimized
by their vendors and contractors, underlining the broader vulnerability in this sector. In
the pharmaceutical industry, the most common causes of data breaches are malicious
attacks (45%), human error (28%) and IT failure (27%). Threat actors tend to favor phishing,
compromised credentials and cloud misconfigurations when targeting these industries.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Hospitality

The Hospitality industry has come under increasing cyber threat, mainly due to its rich
stores of sensitive customer data, heavy financial transaction traffic and sprawling
IT networks. An industry assessment disclosed that nearly 31% of businesses in this
sector reported at least one data security incident. Several factors exacerbate this cyber
vulnerability—top among them are the high employee turnover rate, widespread use
of public WiFi by customers and the sector’s high-profile brand presence—making it an
attractive prospect for cybercriminals looking to tap into data or monetary assets.

Amid a backdrop of cybersecurity pressures, the Hospitality sector has managed to nudge
its security culture score upward from 70 to 71, still low-moderate, since the previous report.
In this context, the Responsibilities dimension experienced a notable uptick, from 65 to 69,
underscoring a growing sense of individual accountability. The Attitudes dimension saw an
encouraging climb by three points, signifying a shift in mindset toward security concerns.
Similarly, both the Cognition and Communication dimensions advanced by two points,
although Cognition (68) and Responsibilities (69) still linger behind as the less favorably rated
aspects within the sector’s security posture. To further enhance the industry’s security
framework, leaders should champion comprehensive, continuous cybersecurity awareness
initiatives that reach employees at all levels, underlining the criticality of cybersecurity as well
as the collective responsibility each staff member holds in safeguarding the organization.

A case in point is the formidable cyber assault faced by MGM Resorts International
in September 2023, when the company suffered a ransomware attack with financial
repercussions surpassing $100 million. While this attack was particularly severe, the
Hospitality sector generally reckons with a considerable cost of around $3.4 million on
average for such breaches. As the sector increasingly adopts generative AI to refine
guest experiences via automated chatbots and translation tools, it simultaneously raises
the specter of additional data security concerns. The widespread advent of contactless
payment technologies at dining venues and the confluence of smartphones with payment
processing equipment also pave new potential paths for cybercriminal exploitation.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Insurance

The Insurance sector, scoring a mid-moderate 76 on the security culture score, experiences
a significant ripple effect when subjected to a cyber attack, impacting not only the insurers
themselves but also their clientele and all interconnected entities. Insurance companies
hold vast stores of personally identifiable information (PII), along with policyholder
details, financial data and medical records. These assets position them as prime targets
for ransomware and other forms of cyber attacks. The sector operates under stringent
regulations related to data privacy and collection. Concurrently, advancements in AI
technology are enhancing accuracy and expediting processes, revolutionizing the sector
by assisting in risk assessment, fraud detection and the minimization of human errors in
administrative tasks. The infusion of AI is shifting the industry landscape through increased
automation, claims optimization and more tailored customer engagement models.

The Insurance sector generally boasts some of the higher dimension scores in the
Security Culture Index compared to other industries evaluated. With Behaviors (79),
Attitudes (78) and Compliance (77) dimensions ranking high moderate, there is still
room for growth in Cognition (72) and Responsibilities (71), which are at the low-
moderate end. By helping employees draw clear links between their good intentions
and their understanding of concrete actions toward enhancing organizational
security, insurance companies can further fortify their cybersecurity posture.

In 2023, the industry faced significant breaches, such as the ones at Sun Life and Genworth
Financial, which affected thousands to millions of individuals. The trend seems persistent, with
the Insurance sector identified as especially vulnerable according to KnowBe4’s 2023 Phishing

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Legal

The Legal industry has maintained a steady security culture score of mid-moderate 74
compared to the previous year, showcasing no significant improvement. Given the high
value placed on confidentiality in lawyer-client relationships, law firms have become
a favored target for cybercriminals. Any breach can have dire consequences, such
as reputational damage, financial repercussions and hefty legal penalties. Sensitive
materials like personally identifiable information, criminal histories, medical and financial
records and proprietary business data are abundant within these organizations.
The inadvertent exposure of such confidential client data would be detrimental. To
prevent such outcomes and avoid public disclosure, law firms are often inclined to
pay ransoms demanded in cyber extortion cases. A report from Bloomberg Law cited
a 2022 survey by the American Bar Association where more than a quarter of law
firms acknowledged experiencing a data breach, an increase from the year prior.

In the scoring of specific security culture dimensions, the Legal sector performs well in
Communication (77), Compliance (75) and Attitudes (75). Law firms, known for their strong
communication skills, use this strength to ensure that everyone within the organization is
informed and provided with necessary resources. Although employees are knowledgeable
about policies and feel strongly about security concerns, there remains a disconnect when
it comes to accepting personal Responsibilities (69) for the firm’s overall protection. Security
Week cited a breach affecting Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, highlighting the challenges
when over 600,000 individuals’ data were compromised earlier in 2023 during a network
intrusion. The repercussions of such breaches often lead to legal actions like class lawsuits.

Additionally, advancements in AI technology are optimizing the way law firms review and
process legal documents, conduct research across extensive case files and detect errors.
These advancements promise considerable savings in time and resources while increasing
precision in legal tasks. Also, AI-related errors can potentially cause hardships for clients. As AI

on outdated operating systems, disjointed security measures and a tendency to downplay the
importance of regular security training. The sector often encompasses a diverse workforce
with varying levels of cybersecurity preparedness. Despite these challenges, manufacturing
firms tend to inadvertently offer cybercriminals multiple opportunities for entry—whether
through customer interfaces or third-party vendor relationships—compounded by the
elaborate and intertwined nature of supply chains. On a positive note, advancements in AI
are becoming indispensable for manufacturers globally. Autonomous robotics and predictive
analytics powered by machine learning are enhancing efficiency, boosting production and
reducing environmental impact. These technologies are not replacing human workers so
much as supplementing their capabilities, allowing for safer and more productive labor.

In the Security Culture Index, the Manufacturing sector achieved mid-moderate scores
of 75 in both Attitudes and Behaviors. However, other dimensions remain lower, with
Cognition notably at a mediocre 67. While there is recognition among employees that they
can contribute to organizational security, a gap in actionable know-how persists. A case in
point is the ransomware attack on Applied Materials in February 2023, where a supplier
inadvertently became the source of a breach affecting the semiconductor giant. This incident
underscores the vulnerability of supply chains and the potential financial consequences,
estimated at $250 million for the Applied Materials attack. Cybersecurity professionals
highlight this concern, noting that cyber attacks may shift focus to less secure nodes in the
supply chain, potentially leading to security breaches in manufacturing down the line.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Nonprofit

The Nonprofit sector, with a security culture score of low moderate 72, is particularly
vulnerable to cyber threats. Nonprofits frequently operate on tight budgets with lean teams
and antiquated systems, leaving little financial leeway for investing in cybersecurity training
or resources. There’s a common misconception among such organizations that they aren’t
attractive targets for cybercriminals. However, the simplicity with which these entities can be
exploited and the fact that attacks can be replicated across the sector make them potentially
lucrative for attackers. Nonprofits house vast quantities of personal and financial information,
making the stakes high. Any security slip-up can severely affect donations, partnerships
and public trust. Moreover, these organizations often depend on outsourced services or
part-time staff, which might widen security gaps, particularly regarding third-party access.

In March 2023, the case of Blackbaud, a cloud software provider for nonprofit
entities, highlighted these challenges. The company incurred a $3 million SEC fine for
not fully disclosing the extent of a 2020 ransomware attack, during which intruders
obtained sensitive donor information. The nondisclosure of a ransom payment to
secure a deletion promise from the culprits further complicated the issue.

Assessing Security Index Scores, most remain moderately low, except for Responsibilities;
at 69, it tends toward the upper end of mediocrity. Dimension scores for Communication
(75) and Attitudes (74) rank as the highest in the sector. This reveals a disconnect:
while nonprofits communicate security practices and employees acknowledge the
necessity of secure behavior, there appears to be a shortfall in empowering them to take
proactive responsibility, often due to a lack of adequate tools, training and support.

Yet, as AI technology progresses, it provides a silver lining for the Nonprofit sector. Innovations
in AI can revolutionize fundraising and management, helping nonprofit employees refine
donor engagement, screen potential contributors, forecast giving patterns, and more
effectively pair volunteers to programs aligning with their experience and interests.

local courier services. Payment methods, too, have diversified beyond traditional channels,
embracing tap-to-pay systems, cash apps like Venmo and Zelle, Apple Pay and even in-app
purchases on social networks. These developments have dramatically simplified and
reshaped consumer buying habits. Bolstered by AI, the Retail industry anticipates better
customer segmentation, more streamlined operations, and the ability to refine pricing,
forecasting and marketing strategies, as outlined by the National Retail Federation.

Despite an array of compliance obligations encompassing PCI DSS, SOX, HIPAA and several
state-level privacy laws, retail operators continue to draw the attention of cybercriminals.
Areas of vulnerability range from Point of Sale (POS) systems susceptible to intrusion to
supply chain networks where vendors may inadvertently introduce malware into secure
environments, providing criminals access to vast amounts of personal data and credit
card information. Within the Security Culture Index, the Behaviors (75) and Attitudes
(74) dimensions perform moderately well, yet Responsibilities (69) and Cognition (67)
figures indicate a need for drastic improvement. This dichotomy suggests employees
appreciate the importance of security and recognize the potential influence of their
actions, yet lack complete understanding of the specific risks facing their sector. That
appears to result in less personal ownership of cyber protective measures. A case
highlighting these vulnerabilities comes from an MSSP Alert report in August 2023,
where Dollar Tree suffered a data breach affecting some 2 million individuals, traced
back to a compromised third-party service provider, Zeroed-In Technologies.

Areas for Improvement
Retail and Wholesale businesses must
acknowledge the complex network of vendor
relationships that extend beyond their
immediate partnerships, encompassing
layers of subcontracted suppliers whose
security measures might not be as
transparent or robust. These successive
layers of vendor relationships, which can
often be several degrees removed from
the primary entity, could harbor security

weaknesses not immediately apparent
to retail leaders. Developing a layered
defense strategy that includes modernizing
control systems and technologies (such
as POS systems and advanced anti-fraud
mechanisms), revising and reinforcing
policies, authenticating customer data, as
well as offering continuous, thorough staff
training and assessment, will aid these
businesses in pinpointing and monitoring
potential vulnerabilities more effectively.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Technology

The Technology sector faces substantial headwinds as it deals with a tangle of challenges
around supply lines, staffing and innovation, now complicated by the larger global
economic situation and market uncertainty. The industry is being forced to adapt as
consumers tighten their purse strings, product demand falls and market caps shrink. In
response, they’re streamlining their operations, automating with AI, and in some cases
reconsidering inorganic growth through M&A. This sector’s overall security score has
decreased by two points since last year, down to 74. To improve their security culture, they
will need to make significant additional efforts. The Technology sector’s overall security
culture score has experienced a concerning drop, from 76 to 74 (both mid moderate), with
the exception of the Behaviors dimension (79 points), which remained consistent. The
Cognition and Communication dimensions have particularly suffered a decrease, falling
from 73 and 77 points to 71 and 75 points, respectively, in the current evaluation.

In 2023, data breaches have been a major concern for technology companies, particularly
those that aim to protect customers from cyber threats. The year saw several notable
breaches, including the MOVEit attacks, which exploited a vulnerability in Progress Software’s
file transfer product. The Russian-speaking hacker group Clop has been particularly active
this year, targeting IT industry companies like IBM, Cognizant and Deloitte with data extortion
attempts. The attacks on these companies are believed to be part of the larger MOVEit
breaches that impacted over 2,000 organizations. In addition, other major cyber attacks have
affected top IT channel players such as CDW and ScanSource, as well as vendors with large
partner bases like Barracuda and Cisco. These attacks have exploited vulnerabilities in some
of the most widely used products, causing significant disruptions to business operations.

These tech trends may be attributed to the recent shifts in the technology sector’s job
market, which has resulted in a loss of seasoned professionals and their corresponding
cyber hygiene practices. This loss could impact security culture until new hires can
be adequately trained and contribute to a supportive corporate security culture.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Transportation

The Transportation sector is known to be cyclical. However, 2023 proved to be uniquely
challenging for logistics companies. Though freight volumes and available capacity
of the market ebb and flow predictably, multiple factors such as inflation, increased
consumer credit usage and shifting consumer spending patterns away from goods
and toward services are putting immense pressure on transportation companies.
Despite these challenges, the Transportation sector maintains a consistent security
culture score of low moderate 71, remaining unchanged from the previous year.

Trucking and logistics organizations have become a target for evolving cybersecurity
threats as more operations rely on connected technologies. With the implementation of
electronic logging and advanced features in newer fleet vehicles, the surface for cyber
attacks has expanded significantly. As a result, transportation leaders are increasingly
concerned about these growing risks. A recent Travelers Risk Index report found that
55% of respondents were worried about cyber attacks, with nearly 25% confirming
their companies had already been victims of cyber crime. In recent months, high-profile
attacks on Estes Express Lines and Orbcomm have highlighted the severity of the issue.
Despite their traditionally simplistic technological infrastructure, the transition to digital
operations has made transportation networks a more visible target for threat actors.

Areas for Improvement
The Transportation sector’s security culture
needs improvement. This year’s survey results
show a two-point drop in Responsibilities
to 67 and a one-point drop in Behaviors to
74. This is in line with the previous iteration
of this report, which identified a need for
improvement across all aspects of their
security culture. Taking a holistic approach

and addressing all dimensions of security
culture within the Transportation sector
can help raise current issues and mitigate
future ones. This approach should include:

1. Promoting personal responsibility: Educate
employees on the importance of taking
personal responsibility for their actions and
how it relates to overall organizational security.

(Continued on next page)

IndUsTRy bEnChMaRk

(Continued from previous page)

2. Model desired behaviors: Demonstrate
positive behaviors that staff can emulate.
Provide guidance on best practices
for security and how these behaviors
benefit the company and employees.

3. Encourage reporting: Ensure that staff feel
comfortable reporting issues and potential
breaches. Implement a system that allows for
anonymity and protection from retaliation.

4. Address challenges in the physical and digital
environment: Consider the unique challenges

of the Transportation sector, such as managing
a mobile workforce, and ensure that security
policies and practices address these issues.

5. Provide adequate resources and training:
Invest in employee training and resources
to help them feel empowered in their role
and to build confidence in their work.

By focusing on these areas and taking a
comprehensive approach, the Transportation
sector can improve its security culture
and ensure that all employees are working
toward maintaining a secure environment.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Guidance for Improving
security Culture in
any Organization

By Joanna Huisman

While having a strategy is fundamental,
formulating the appropriate plan with the
most effective actions is paramount for
achieving desired outcomes. KnowBe4
Research suggests a framework for
understanding cultural transformation,
encapsulated in the ABC’s: Awareness,
Behavior and Culture. This approach
emphasizes a progressive journey from
cultivating awareness to inspiring behavioral
changes, which ultimately converge to
shape and enhance organizational culture.

Understanding can shape actions and
modifying actions can catalyze a shift
in cultural norms. This logical sequence
should be kept in mind while devising a
roadmap for enhancing cultural ethos.
Although mere awareness may not directly

result in altered behaviors, it can serve
as a potent mechanism for influencing
them when presented in a content that
resonates. Similarly, while transformation
of an individual’s behavior might not be
synonymous with cultural transformation,
the collective behavioral change of a group
indeed signifies a cultural evolution.

To enhance the clarity and impact of the
cultural transformation, a clear structure
needs to be implemented. As detailed in
the comprehensive KnowBe4 whitepaper
titled “The Security Culture How-to Guide:
Seven Steps to Improve Your Organization’s
Security Culture,” outlined below are the
seven fundamental stages in the continuous
enhancement cycle in order to start on
your security culture transformation.

GUIdanCE fOR IMPROvInG sECURITy CULTURE

78

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Get Leadership Buy-In

Ensure leadership engagement by preparing
a concise executive summary that outlines
the objectives and secures backing of the
organization’s decision-makers. Solidify their
support with a formal commitment to the
action items set forth. Without endorsement
from the executive level, any plan risks
faltering and becoming futile, as employee
buy-in often hinges on the recognition that
the initiative is backed by the business. Also,
seeing leadership exemplify the expected
behaviors reinforces their importance
and encourages employees to follow.

Communicate

Communication is key in this step also.
Devise an employee communication
strategy that connects with employees on
a personal level and seek collaboration
from different departments to make sure
the message is both seen and heard.
Additionally, offer accessible support to
address any employee feedback or concerns.

Choose Two or Three
Behaviors You Would
Like to Change

Focus on behavior selection by pinpointing
two or three high-risk behaviors that
warrant attention and use KnowBe4’s
Security Culture Survey to gauge the
current stance and establish a clear starting
point. Now is the moment for precision
and focus; it’s essential to carefully curate
your actions to ensure they are directly
aligned with the overall organizational
goals and specifically the results you aim
to achieve. This is not the time to try and
tackle everything at once, be selective.

Design a Plan to
Influence Behaviors on an
Organizational Scale

Behavior change can be effectively
orchestrated through formal mechanisms
such as establishment or modification of
policies, or it can be cultivated through
informal and social channels, frequently
involving leaders or champions modeling
the desired behaviors in a concerted
effort to guide the workforce.

Engage in strategic plan development,
where you will set feasible schedules for
the intended behavioral interventions
and appoint enthusiastic organizational
champions who will advocate for these
changes. Security Champions ensure
communications are presented in clear,
accessible language tailored to the specific
needs of each country or department
and are easy to comprehend. Recognizing
diversity in communication preferences, it’s
crucial to tailor information delivery to align
as closely as possible with each segment’s
preferred method of receiving messages.

GUIdanCE fOR IMPROvInG sECURITy CULTURE

Execute the Plan

Determine the Move
Forward Strategy

Moving on to implementation, outline explicit
goals and success indicators, complete
with a well-planned timeline, all the while
keeping open lines of communication with
both champions and the executive team,
providing support wherever necessary.

Measure Results

For evaluation, a subsequent Security
Culture Survey should be conducted
to measure progress and analyze any
shifts or changes in culture from the first
survey conducted. These findings need
to then be shared with leadership in a
simple but comprehensive report.

Lastly, actively solicit input from key
stakeholders and use this insight to refine
strategies for the future. Regularly updating
behavioral targets in response to evolving
threats will ensure the organization remains
proactive in its approach to cultivating
a robust security culture. Keep in mind
that cyber crime is a continually evolving
threat that shows no signs of diminishing.
Instead, it’s escalating with each passing
day, becoming increasingly complex and
pervasive. You must remain vigilant,
always ready to preemptively address
shifts in the landscape. Flexibility is key
and you should be prepared to adjust your
course swiftly if the threat demands it.

The overall message is this: Avoid feeling
daunted…begin the journey. These
suggested steps provide a straightforward
strategy for setting out on a path that
yields long-term benefits in fortifying your
organization’s security and enhancing
the preparedness of your workforce.

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024about
the Report

KnowBe4 Research developed
this report using the highest
research standards. The report leverages
anonymized data from KnowBe4’s Security
Culture Survey. The sample size represents 10,539
surveyed organizations around the world, with more
than 1,822,748 employees across 18 industry sectors,
effectively making this the largest report of its kind published to
date. What follows is a description of the methods used to analyze
the data, along with descriptive tables.

abOUT ThE REPORT

81

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024How Data Was Collected
The data for this report was collected using the
Security Culture Survey, which is available to KnowBe4
customers via the Kevin Mitnick Security Awareness Training
(KMSAT) platform. The Security Culture Survey was developed
by CLTRe based on a scientific approach that integrates survey
methodology, statistics and scientific findings from security culture
research and psychometrics.

The survey consists of four items for each distinct dimension of security
culture, a total of 28 items. The question set and methodology have been
refined over several years. The data collection period was from 2019
to 2023 and represents customers from around the globe.

Data Preprocessing
To ensure validity and reliability,
the data was cleaned before any
calculations were conducted. A
listwise deletion of missing data
was conducted, which means that
responses with missing values were
deleted. Furthermore, respondents
who used less than two minutes on
the survey were excluded, as they
would not have taken the time to
read questions before answering.
Organizations with fewer than 10
valid employee responses were
excluded, as these were considered
accounts for testing the survey and
thus do not measure a representative
proportion of the organization.

The data for this report is based on a single data collection
time point for each employee and was then anonymized
and aggregated. All data analysis was performed

in the software environment.

Data Size
The data consists of
1,895,344 employees and
11,128 organizations. For the trends
analysis, the final sample after data
cleaning consisted of 1,822,748 employees
and 10,539 organizations that completed
the Security Culture Survey. For the industry
benchmarks for 2023, the final sample consisted
of 816,733 employees and 4,078 organizations
that completed the Security Culture Survey.
Data was collected from 111 countries.

abOUT ThE REPORT

82

KnowBe4 Security Culture Report 2024Statistical Analyses
The values that employees provide on the 28 security culture items are transformed into
eight metrics for each organization. The first seven metrics correspond to each of the seven
security culture dimensions. The final metric is the security culture score, which is calculated
by taking the mean of all the dimension scores. All scores have a range from zero to 100.
The Security Culture Survey, and therefore this report, is created as a multi-level statistical
analytics tool, where individual respondents are aggregated to the level of an organization.

One of the benefits of aggregating scores to an organization level rather than at the
employee level, is that the effects of organization size on industry benchmarks
were neutralized. The unique algorithm for this transformation was
designed by CLTRe and based on a complex conceptual
understanding of organizational
security culture.

Moreover, to enhance the accuracy and representativeness of our analysis, we implemented
a data weighting strategy. After aggregating scores to the organizational level, the data
was weighted to account for variations in organization size and response rates.

This was accomplished by assigning weights to each organization’s score based on the
number of valid responses it contributed. This weighting ensures that organizations with a
larger number of responses have a proportionate influence on the overall results, preventing
any single organization from skewing the industry benchmarks unduly. Additionally, for a
global perspective, data was grouped by continent and further weighted by the number
of organizations and employees in each group, ensuring accurate continental analysis.
