The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity Risk## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The presence of any
data relating to your
organization on the
dark web demonstrably
increases your risk
of a cyberattack.

That is the core finding from the Marsh
McLennan Cyber Risk Intelligence Center’s
comprehensive study, which analyzed our dark
web dataset against a sample of more than
9,000 organizations.

Of that sample, 3.7 percent of the organizations
had suffered one or more cyber insurance losses
in the last four years. What the Marsh McLennan
team wanted to determine was whether those
breaches had a higher likelihood of occurring,
based on dark web intelligence in the year
leading up to the incident.

### PRE-ATTACK INTELLIGENCE

The dark web is an obfuscated part of
the internet that is prolifically used by
cybercriminals to communicate between one
another, plan their attacks, and buy, sell, and
build the tools they need to execute them.

This activity is known as the “pre-attack” phase
of a cybersecurity incident: the actions that
cybercriminals undertake before they launch
their campaign against an organization and
breach their network.

It stands to reason that the presence of this
pre-attack activity against a specific
organization would mean that they have an
increased likelihood of being the victim of a
cybersecurity incident - and that is exactly what
Marsh McLennan’s study confirmed.

In this report, Marsh McLennan’s team
demonstrated a statistically significant
correlation between all of our dark web
intelligence sources - including (but not limited
to) dark web market listings, hacking forum
chatter, and dark web traffic to and from the
corporate network - and an increased likelihood
of suffering a cybersecurity incident. Put simply:
the presence of any dark web findings related
to an organization - without exception - was
associated with a higher likelihood of a breach.

Searchlight Cyber

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity RiskWhile every single source shows an increased
risk of a cyberattack, organizations need
visibility of all the sources to truly understand
their cybersecurity risk. Soley gathering
intelligence on compromised user accounts, for
example, does not provide the whole picture
if you can’t see whether the organization is
listed on a dark web marketplace. This study
shows through a multi-variable analysis how
multiple dark web intelligence sources can
lead to a more reliable estimate of combined
cybersecurity risk.

### ACTING ON
CYBERSECURITY RISK

The analysis confirms that dark web intelligence
is highly correlated with forthcoming
cyber incidents. What matters now is how
organizations act on this information.

The first step has to be to gain visibility into
your exposure on the dark web. Understanding
where the organization is vulnerable is
critical for informing defense and the value
of pre-attack intelligence is that it creates an
invaluable window of time for the security
team to act before the network is breached.
If the exposure is identified early enough,
the company can take action to prevent the
cybersecurity incident.

Furthermore, all security teams have pressure
on resources, which means they have to decide
where to prioritize their efforts based on the
highest levels of risk. Marsh McLennan’s study
has determined which dark web intelligence
sources are most correlated to cybersecurity
incident frequency, which can help
organizations to determine the dark web threats
they should focus on.

Once visibility into threats emerging from dark
webs is established, it is then critical that this
exposure is continuously monitored. The dark
web is anything but static; new sites emerge
every day, thousands of posts are written on
hacking forums, new products are bought and
sold on illicit markets. An organization’s dark
web exposure will fluctuate over time and
identifying new threats quickly is the key to
mitigating risk and reducing the chances of a
cybersecurity incident.

## INTRODUCTION

Marsh McLennan’s Cyber Risk Intelligence Center conducted this study to determine if intelligence
sources from the dark web were correlated with the frequency of cyber insurance claims.  Searchlight
Cyber was able to generate hundreds of results related to the organizations Marsh McLennan assessed,
and showed a statistically significant correlation to cyber incident data.

### SCOTT STRANSKY
MANAGING DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF THE CYBER RISK INTELLIGENCE CENTER, MARSH MCLENNAN

Historically the insurance industry has focused on data from within an organization, such as
questionnaires, along with outside-in technographic scans for determining cybersecurity risk.
While this data is extremely valuable, ignoring dark web factors external to the organization’s
network leaves the industry with a blind spot around who could be targeting the organizations
they insure and the resources those cybercriminals possess to execute their attacks.

Our analysis of the dark web intelligence market found that this dataset is highly correlated with
cyber insurance loss frequency. We are delighted to be able to share the results of the analysis we
conducted with Searchlight Cyber, which showed that external threat factors are correlated with
cybersecurity incident frequency.

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity Risk

## METHODOLOGY

Marsh McLennan aimed to establish the correlation between data breaches and findings on the dark
web for organizations a year before the breach, as collected by Searchlight Cyber. The study involved
9,410 organizations with an overall breach rate of 3.7 percent from 2020 to 2023. It consists of two
major analyses:

1.

Examining the impact of findings in dark web intelligence sources one-by-one
(single-variable analysis)

2.

Examining the impact of findings in dark web intelligence sources jointly
(multi-variable analysis)

## KEY FINDINGS

ALL NINE OF SEARCHLIGHT CYBER’S DARK WEB INTELLIGENCE
SOURCES WERE FOUND TO HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT
CORRELATION TO INCREASED CYBERSECURITY RISK.

THE INDIVIDUAL FACTORS THAT WERE CORRELATED WITH THE LARGEST
INCREASE IN THE CHANCE OF A CYBER INSURANCE CLAIM WERE
COMPROMISED USER ACCOUNTS (2.56X), DARK WEB MARKET LISTINGS
(2.41X), AND OUTGOING DARK WEB TRAFFIC (2.11X), RELATIVE TO
ORGANIZATIONS WITH ZERO FINDINGS IN THOSE FACTORS.

COMBINING MULTIPLE DARK WEB SOURCES PROVIDES A
STRONGER INDICATION OF INCREASED CYBER RISK
THAN IN ISOLATION.

PASTE RESULTS, OSINT RESULTS, AND DARK WEB MARKET
LISTINGS WERE FOUND TO BE THE MOST CORRELATED TO
INSURANCE CYBER LOSS FREQUENCY IN CONJUNCTION WITH
OTHER FACTORS.

## DARK WEB INTELLIGENCE SOURCES EXPLAINED

Marsh McLennan’s analysis found a significant statistical correlation between all of
Searchlight Cyber’s dark web intelligence sources and the increased risk of a cybersecurity
incident within the next 12 months.

### DARK WEB MARKET LISTINGS

The mention of the organization or data related to the organization on a dark web market.
Dark web markets operate in much the same way as regular online marketplaces such
as Amazon or eBay but specialize in illicit goods that cannot be sold on the clear web.
Cybercriminals use dark web marketplaces to sell company data, as well as access to
systems and infrastructure.

### FORUM POSTS

The mention of the organization or data related to the organization on a dark web forum.
Forums are often used by threat actors to discuss tactics, techniques, and to share exploits
when targeting an organization. For example, Initial Access Brokers - a type of cybercriminal
that specializes in selling access to an organization’s network - often hold auctions on dark
web forums.

### COMPROMISED USERS

Compromised accounts on the dark web related to an organization. Data such as passwords,
email addresses, and usernames can be obtained through a number of means, including
through phishing campaigns, the use of infostealer malware, or through a third party data
breach if employees have used work credentials for other services. Stolen username and
password combinations are one of the most common vectors of a cyberattack.

### TELEGRAM CHATS

The mention of the organization or data related to the organization on Telegram, a
communication platform that is commonly used by cybercriminals to conduct pre-attack
activity. Telegram channels are used to share cybercriminal and fraud techniques, sell
hacking tools, and leak stolen databases.

8

Searchlight Cyber

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity Risk### INCOMING DARK WEB TRAFFIC

Traffic originating from the dark web and connecting to an organization’s infrastructure.
This means that someone from the dark web is visiting the network. Depending on the
component they are connecting to and the size of the data, this could be an indicator of
malicious activities ranging from cybercriminal reconnaissance, to port scanning, all the way
up to malware installation.

### OUTGOING DARK WEB TRAFFIC

Traffic originating from the organization’s network and connecting to the dark web. This
means that someone within the corporate environment is calling out to the dark web. This
could be an indicator of malicious activity taking place on the network, such as Command
and Control (C2) malware beaconing out, or a malicious insider visiting dark web forums,
marketplaces, or sites.

### DARK WEB PAGES

The mention of an organization or data related to an organization on a dark web site.
Dark web pages are similar to websites on the clear web but are hosted through networks
such as The Onion Router (Tor) to provide the site creator and its visitors with anonymity.
As such, dark web pages typically contain a wide variety of illicit or illegal activity.

### PASTE RESULTS

The mention of an organization or data related to an organization on plain-text repositories
that are designed to facilitate the sharing of large blocks of computer data in online forums.
Cybercriminals are known to post stolen or illegal information on paste sites, including
organizational data that has been captured in data breaches.

### OSINT RESULTS

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) results are extracted from all Searchlight Cyber data feeds
and represent all of the assets related to an organization - such as IP addresses and web
domains - that have been identified on the dark web. These assets could represent a point of
vulnerability that cybercriminals are looking to exploit.

### HOW EACH DARK WEB SOURCE INDIVIDUALLY IMPACTS CYBER RISK

Marsh McLennan examined the impact of findings in each of the dark web fields individually in a
single-variable analysis, demonstrating that a result in any field in the previous 12 months increased
the risk of a cyber insurance loss. This statistical correlation was established using confidence intervals
(see methodology in Appendix 1).

Figure 1 shows the percentage of organizations who had a breach with and without a finding in each
category, and clearly demonstrates the impact each dark web finding has on the level of risk.
It shows that organizations who appeared in Dark Web Market Listings had the highest breach rate
(8.67 percent), followed by those with presence in Telegram Chats (7.47 percent), and those with
Incoming Dark Web Traffic (7.08 percent).

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity RiskAnother way to look at this data is to look at the difference between the breach rate with and without
findings, to determine the increased likelihood of an attack when an item is found on the dark web.

Figure 2 shows that the presence of Compromised Users has the greatest impact on the likelihood of
breach, compared to when no Compromised Users were found. Four factors make the organization
more than twice as likely to experience a breach than if they weren’t present: Compromised Users
(2.56x), Dark Web Market Listings (2.41x), Outgoing Dark Web Traffic (2.11x), and OSINT Results (2.05x).

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity Risk### THE COMBINED RISK OF MULTIPLE DARK WEB SOURCES

Marsh McLennan then undertook a multi-variable analysis, which is used to establish the importance
of an intelligence source if an organization has results in more than one category as well as controlling
for industry and revenue, which also correlates with frequency. Results in multiple categories provide
a more accurate indication of cybersecurity risk but the risk model has to account for correlations
between sources (see methodology in Appendix 2).

This analysis showed that five dark web intelligence sources are statistically correlated with risk in
combination with other factors: Paste Results, OSINT Results, Dark Web Market Listings, Outgoing Dark
Web Traffic, and Compromised Users.

This does not suggest that the other intelligence sources aren’t predictive - as the previous section
establishes, they are all independently correlated with cybersecurity risk - but ascertains which sources
are most useful when multiple correlated sources are present.

Figure 4 shows that Paste Results are the most correlated with risk in a multi-variable analysis,
increasing the risk of a cyberattack 1.15x. In other words, the presence of an organization’s domain,
email addresses, or code repositories on a paste site increases its likelihood of a cyberattack by 15
percent, in comparison with its peers.

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity RiskThe benefit of multi-variable analysis is that it allows us to accurately calculate the cybersecurity risk
in the likely scenario that an organization has results for more than one intelligence source, as there is
correlation between the categories (see calculation in Appendix 2). For example:

If an organization has
Compromised Users (7 percent) and
Dark Web Market Listings (13 percent)
it is overall 21 percent more likely to
suffer a cybersecurity incident relative
to its peers.

If an organization has
OSINT Results (14 percent) and
Paste Results (15 percent)
it is 31 percent more likely to
suffer a cybersecurity incident
relative to its peers.

If an organization has results in
all five of the intelligence sources
in Figure 4 it is 77 percent more likely
to suffer a cybersecurity incident
relative to its peers.

77%The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity Risk## RECOMMENDATIONS

Marsh McLennan’s analysis shows a statistical correlation between dark web exposure and
cybersecurity risk. Searchlight Cyber recommends the following five steps organizations should take to
act on these results:

1

### GAIN VISIBILITY INTO YOUR DARK WEB EXPOSURE

The first step all organizations should take is to gain visibility of their exposure by collecting
dark web intelligence. Cybersecurity teams can only take mitigating actions to reduce
cybersecurity risk if they can identify where on the dark web they are being targeted.
Understanding their points of exposure and mitigating their cybersecurity risk will help
organizations minimize the financial, reputational, and legal impact of cyberattacks.

2

### PURSUE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF DARK WEB
### INTELLIGENCE SOURCES

Each dark web source is individually a reliable indicator of cybersecurity risk but if an
organization is missing sources there may be threats that they are unaware of. As the
study shows, they will also have a less reliable view of their combined cybersecurity risk.
Cybersecurity teams need to establish that they have coverage of all areas of the dark web -
marketplaces, forums, paste sites, Telegram channels, and dark web sites. They also need to
monitor for particular signals that could indicate an impending cybersecurity attack - such
as dark web traffic to and from the corporate network, or compromised users that could be a
path into the corporate network.

16

Searchlight Cyber

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity Risk3

### FOCUS ON ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE

While the presence of findings in any dark web category provides organizations with a high-
level overview of risk, a comprehensive assessment of the threat and the implementation of
defensive measures requires a far more granular level of intelligence. For example, knowing
that a cybercriminal is discussing an organization on a dark web forum is not enough.
Cybersecurity teams need sources that provide them the intelligence on the forum, the
cybercriminal that has made the post, and what exactly the cybercriminal has posted about
them in order to establish what action they need to take next.

4

### USE EXPOSURE AND RISK DATA TO INFORM DEFENSIVE
### STRATEGIES

Visibility into where the organization is exposed, and knowledge of the risk associated
with each of those threats, is most valuable when it is applied in prioritizing resources. All
cybersecurity teams have stretched resources, which means that tough decisions need
to be made on where budget, staff, and tooling can be applied most effectively. These
decisions should be led by intelligence on the most likely paths to a cyberattack. Ideally,
this intelligence should be specific to the organization, as each business has its own unique
cybersecurity challenges and adversaries.

5

### UNDERTAKE CONTINUOUS MONITORING

A single, point-in-time analysis of an organization’s dark web exposure is insufficient for
protecting an organization in the long term. As cybersecurity professionals are well aware,
the threat landscape is always evolving. Cybercriminals develop new tactics, identify new
points of weakness, and select new targets on a daily basis. Organizations therefore need
to continuously monitor their dark web exposure for the earliest possible warning of an
emerging threat. Cybersecurity risk will fluctuate over time but if organizations identify
new threats quickly they will be most successful in stopping the risk of a cyberattack from
becoming a reality.

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity Risk## APPENDIX 1: SINGLE-VARIABLE ANALYSIS

Single-variable analysis was calculated by establishing the breach rate for those who had a finding in a
specific category versus those who didn’t, with confidence intervals created using a beta distribution.

Figure 6 shows the single-variant analysis presented on Page 10 with confidence intervals displayed.
The fact that the confidence intervals between “Incident Rate Without Findings” and “Incident Rate
With Findings” do not overlap in any category demonstrates that all dark web intelligence sources are
statistically correlated to increased insurance loss frequency.

For example, findings for Compromised Users was shown to have a 4.78 percent breach rate in Marsh
McLennan’s analysis (indicated by the arrows) with a lower confidence interval of 4.46 percent and an
upper confidence interval of 5.12 percent. What is significant is that the lower confidence interval is
higher than the upper confidence interval of no findings (2.57 percent).

The Correlation Between Dark Web Exposure and Cybersecurity Risk## APPENDIX 2: MULTI-VARIABLE ANALYSIS

Multi-variable analysis uses a classification model to measure the combined effect of multiple fields
and for hidden factors like revenue and industry. This model accounts for the correlation between
factors and therefore is a more reliable indicator of risk if more than one factor is present.
For example, this study showed there was high-correlation between Forum Posts and other factors,
whereas Paste Results had less correlation with other factors, making it more significant as an indicator
of cybersecurity risk.

For the multi-variable analysis, Marsh McLennan used a logistic regression model built with industry
and revenue accounted for as controls. Confidence intervals were established by sampling the data
with replacement and fitting logistic regression models 1,000 times. If the odds ratio is greater than
1 and the confidence interval does not include 1, it can be concluded that there is a statistically valid
increased risk associated with a dark web finding.

Marsh McLennan’s analysis placed Telegram Chats, Dark Web Pages, and Forum posts below 1.00. Even
Incoming Dark Web Traffic, which McLennan found to be 1.01, was discounted because the confidence
interval crossed 1.00.

The calculation for combined effect (shown on Page 14) is determined by multiplying the odds ratio
together. For example, Compromised Users (1.072) x Dark Web Market Listings (1.129) = 1.210, or a 21
percent increase of experiencing a cybersecurity incident.
