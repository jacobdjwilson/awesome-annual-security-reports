## Strategic Imperative

### Factors Creating Pressure on Growth

- A major challenge for email security solution vendors is the continuous and rapid evolution of the threat landscape, as solutions must keep up with the increasingly sophisticated attacks to various vectors. Attackers target email but also breach organizational defenses via attack vectors such as web-based and other collaboration applications.
- Remote working has introduced new vulnerabilities for users and organizations. Threat actors have taken advantage with new, more sophisticated cyberattacks particularly targeting email.
- Many employees are using personal devices to conduct business. Employees accessing company email from a personal device continue to drive the need for cloud-based email security services.
- Organizations want advanced AI and ML security solutions to combat attacks. Many vendors are promoting API-based solutions as legacy secure email gateways (SEGs) cannot detect the advanced threats organizations are facing.
- Attacks may combine web-based threats with specific email attack methods in multiple stages to try to evade security software solutions.
- AI has gained a tremendous foothold in various aspects of cybersecurity over the past year. Hackers are utilizing AI to launch sophisticated cyberattacks to quickly compromise email accounts to gain access to organizations’ systems and exfiltrate data. AI adoption in email security solutions helps alleviate the ongoing challenge of staying a step ahead of the next attack vector.
- Security vendors increasingly leverage ML and AI, including generative AI, to strengthen organizations' security posture and reduce administrative overhead owing to a lack of security expertise to keep up with the fast-evolving security threats.
- Organizations are outsourcing email security services because they do not have the security staff to do it themselves. This is especially true for small businesses. Many email security solution vendors are catering specifically to this customer group as a result.

## Growth Environment

- The global email security market is worth approximately **$5,451.9 million**, achieving a 22.9% YoY growth rate as of 2023. The market will grow to $9,577.8 million by 2027, indicating a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2027 of **15.1%**.
- The email security market has seen strong double-digit growth for the last few years in response to increasingly severe and sophisticated email-borne cyberattacks.
- Organizations migrating to the cloud are transitioning from on-premises solutions to cloud-delivered solutions. Vendors within the space who are advancing and innovating their cloud-based email security solutions are experiencing continued revenue growth.
- Cloud migration has accelerated as organizations had to adapt to the security challenges of remote working and users had to work outside the traditional network security environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This drove growth for email security in 2020 and 2021 and continued through 2023 as many organizations adopted remote working as their new norm.
- **North America** is the largest email security market. Because of its economy and security maturity, North America hosts most top email security vendors. North America’s domestic requirements to comply with government and healthcare regulations and the many financial institutions contribute to business opportunities for email security vendors.
- **EMEA** is the second-largest market for email security. EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a major driver for email security adoption. The increase in data protection and privacy regulations in this region drives customers to engage or upgrade email security to meet compliance requirements. Frost & Sullivan expects to see an increase in product demand because of concerns relating to cyberattacks, liabilities, and companies’ reputations.
- **APAC and LATAM** are the smallest markets for email security but are seeing growth nonetheless. APAC has lagged North America and EMEA in cloud adoption, but this is changing. LATAM has a promising market with modest activity.
- The **midsize business market** accounts for the largest percentage of revenue for the email security sector. Midsize customers need security; however, they have limited security staff as compared to enterprise companies and depend mostly on managed service providers (MSPs) or managed security service providers (MSSPs) for support.
- The highest spending industries across the email security sector are **banking and finance, healthcare, government, and education**. These are the most widely targeted sectors by cyber criminals because of the types of sensitive data they deal with.

## Competitive Environment

- The email security market is highly competitive and comprised of a plethora of vendors. There are a handful of large security companies, with the rest of the market comprised of email security start-ups.
- Email security start-up vendors have niche technology and frequently enter the market because they recognize a missing need and can provide a solution.
- As organizations are increasingly aware that they must enhance their cybersecurity posture, vendors with innovative, advanced email security technologies will remain top of mind.
- Vendors are developing functions and features to counter advanced threats, adapt to the changing threat landscape, and help organizations transition from on-premises to cloud-based email solutions. Frost & Sullivan selected and plotted the top 21 out of more than 40 market participants in this Frost Radar™ analysis.
- In 2023, the top five vendors had a combined market share of **65.0%**. This has been slowly declining since 2019, indicating inroads being made by other vendors.
- **Proofpoint** has been the market leader since 2015 and is an Innovation leader. It continues to invest heavily in research and development (R&D), and revenues from recent acquisitions and organic growth are resulting in leading market share gains. Proofpoint has a strong focus on innovation to remain a market leader with its technological advancements, in addition to its long-guiding people-centric approach.

## Company to Action: Proofpoint

### Innovation
- Proofpoint continuously innovates and expands its integrated, multilayered threat protection solution. A key differentiator is the ability to continuously detect and stop threats throughout the email delivery flow (pre-delivery and post-delivery to click time).
- In May 2024, Proofpoint announced new adaptive email capabilities integrating AI-based defense post-delivery to stop targeted threats, including protection for lateral internal phishing and advanced email fraud.
- **Newly released innovations include:**
    - **Pre-delivery QR code detection**: Analyzes URL images and embedded URLs within QR codes and sandboxes them inline before message delivery.
    - **Semantic analysis engine**: The industry’s first pre-delivery threat detection engine using a large language model (LLM) to understand the meaning and intent of text to stop advanced threats in Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace.
    - **Enhanced URL protection**: Allows organizations to hold suspicious messages for sandbox analysis based on behavioral signals and threat intelligence.
    - **People-centric approach**: Identifies "Very Attacked People" (VAPs), providing security teams with insights into their organization’s human attack surface.
    - **Reporting suite**: Includes Proofpoint Nexus People Risk Explorer and Business Email Compromise reports, which can be exported for executive stakeholders.
