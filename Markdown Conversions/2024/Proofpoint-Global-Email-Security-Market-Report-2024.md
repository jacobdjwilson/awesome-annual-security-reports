Factors Creating Pressure on Growth
- A major challenge for email security solution vendors is the continuous and rapid evolution of the threat landscape, as solutions must keep up with the increasingly sophisticated attacks to various vectors. Attackers target email but also breach organizational defenses via attack vectors such as web-based and other collaboration applications.
- Remote working has introduced new vulnerabilities for users and organizations. Threat actors have taken advantage with new, more sophisticated cyberattacks particularly targeting email.
- Many employees are using personal devices to conduct business. Employees accessing company email from a personal device continue to drive the need for cloud-based email security services.
- Organizations want advanced AI and ML security solutions to combat attacks. Many vendors are promoting API-based solutions as legacy secure email gateways (SEGs) cannot detect the advanced threats organizations are facing.

Factors Creating Pressure on Growth
- Organizations are outsourcing email security services because they do not have the security staff to do it themselves. This is especially true for small businesses. Many email security solution vendors are catering specifically to this customer group as a result.

### Growth Environment
- The global email security market is worth approximately $5,451.9 million, achieving a 22.9% YoY growth rate as of 2023. The market will grow to $9,577.8 million by 2027, indicating a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2027 of 15.1%.
- The email security market has seen strong double-digit growth for the last few years in response to increasingly severe and sophisticated email-borne cyberattacks.
- Organizations migrating to the cloud are transitioning from on-premises solutions to cloud-delivered solutions. Vendors within the space who are advancing and innovating their cloud-based email security solutions are experiencing continued revenue growth.
- Cloud migration has accelerated as organizations had to adapt to the security challenges of remote working and users had to work outside the traditional network security environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This drove growth for email security in 2020 and 2021 and continued through 2023 as many organizations adopted remote working as their new norm.

### Growth Environment
- North America is the largest email security market. Because of its economy and security maturity, North America hosts most top email security vendors. North America’s domestic requirements to comply with government and healthcare regulations and the many financial institutions contribute to business opportunities for email security vendors.
- EMEA is the second-largest market for email security. EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a major driver for email security adoption. The increase in data protection and privacy regulations in this region drives customers to engage or upgrade email security to meet compliance requirements. Frost & Sullivan expects to see an increase in product demand because of concerns relating to cyberattacks, liabilities, and companies’ reputations. Several email security vendors operate primarily in EMEA and are keen on the stringent compliance regulations within the region.

### Growth Environment
- APAC and LATAM are the smallest markets for email security but are seeing growth nonetheless. APAC has lagged North America and EMEA in cloud adoption, but this is changing despite supply chain disruptions in 2020 hampering vendors’ ability to receive and ship hardware appliances. In contrast, greater demand for cloud-based security to safeguard the sudden increase in remote working buoyed email security market growth. LATAM has a promising market with modest activity. Many vendors are managing the region from their North American offices.
- The midsize business market accounts for the largest percentage of revenue for the email security sector. Midsize customers need security; however, they have limited security staff as compared to enterprise companies and depend mostly on managed service providers (MSPs) or managed security service providers (MSSPs) for support.
- The highest spending industries across the email security sector are banking and finance, healthcare, government, and education. These are the most widely targeted sectors by cyber criminals because of the types of sensitive data they deal with. But overall, adoption is high across every sector as email security is a critical need with some vendors addressing specific industries that require more advanced solutions.
