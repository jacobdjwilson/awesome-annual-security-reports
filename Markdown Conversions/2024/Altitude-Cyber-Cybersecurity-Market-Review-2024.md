### Fudo Security Receives Funding From bValue Growth Fund

Altitude Cyber Served As Exclusive Strategic Advisor To Fudo Security.

Fudo Security is a Silicon Valley headquartered leader in intelligent Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions,
helping organizations effectively identify and mitigate potential security breaches in the digital world while ensuring
regulatory compliance. The company’s products and services enhance control over unauthorized activities, particularly
in managing access to privileged accounts used by IT system administrators and operators handling sensitive data.

The investment secured from the bValue Growth fund will be dedicated to advancing technological development,
introducing groundbreaking solutions, and supporting Fudo Security’s international growth, with a primary focus on
the US market and Europe.

“The decision to invest in Fudo Security is based on solid financial performance, a unique technological product,
scalability potential, and an established position in the promising Privileged Access Management market. In 2023, the
global PAM market was valued at $3 billion, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22%. PAM
solutions enable organizations to identify and mitigate potential security breaches more effectively and respond faster
to unauthorized access attempts by limiting attack vectors,” says Maciej Balsewicz, Founder & Managing Partner at
bValue Fund.

Addressing the choice of bValue as an investment partner, Patryk Brozek, CEO of Fudo Security, remarked: “We
meticulously sought a partner who would not only understand the specifics of our business and recognize the value of
the European segment of our operations but also support our accelerated growth strategy in the U.S. market and our
product vision. What particularly set this fund apart was their holistic approach. They did not limit themselves to
financial analysis alone. From the very beginning, we felt we were working with a partner who genuinely wanted to
understand our business and collaborate to create something extraordinary. We quickly realized that this was a fund
that would truly support our strategic goals.”

In pursuit of broad business expansion, the company is actively building local sales teams, expanding its partner
networks, and working on further product innovations. A significant opportunity for deeper market penetration lies in
introducing a new product designed to manage third-party access to organizational data.

Altitude Cyber Served As Exclusive Financial And Strategic Advisor To Aporia.

Coralogix, a data observability powerhouse, announced that it has acquired Aporia, a cutting-edge platform for AI
observability and guardrails, instantly bringing AI security and reliability to thousands of enterprises. This strategic
acquisition makes Coralogix the first Observability platform to combine insights from both AI and software applications,
allowing its users to gain end-to-end visibility and drive actionable insights for faster and better business results. The
acquisition is expected to create a significant technological player in the global market with unique technological
advantages.

Founded in 2019, Aporia has become a trusted platform for safeguarding AI systems, including generative AI (GenAI) and
classic machine learning. Its customer base spans startups and Fortune 500 companies alike, including Lemonade,
DoorDash, MunichRe, Bosch, Sixt, and more. Aporia’s Guardrails and observability solutions help organizations detect and
resolve AI errors in real time, ensuring reliable and secure AI deployment.

As part of the deal, the company will be launching a dedicated AI research center - Coralogix AI. This center will focus on
solving fundamental problems in AI, including transparency, security, monitoring, governance, and control. Coralogix
is ​expected to invest tens of millions of dollars in this center over the next two years. Liran Hason, CEO of Aporia, and Alon
Gubkin, Aporia’s CTO, will be leading Coralogix AI. The entire Aporia team will move to Coralogix’s offices, where the
technology they developed will be integrated, and the number of employees will be doubled in the next two years.

"This acquisition is a significant step for us. Using Aporia's technology and expertise, hundreds of AI teams already using
Coralogix today will be able to enjoy high-quality visibility, protection, and control over their AI systems." said Coralogix
CEO Ariel Assaraf.

### Eureka Security Acquired By Tenable

Altitude Cyber Served As Exclusive Financial And Strategic Advisor To Eureka Security.

Tenable® Holdings, Inc., the Exposure Management company, announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to
acquire Eureka Security, Inc., a provider of data security posture management (DSPM) for cloud environments. Eureka
Security helps security teams gain a holistic view into an organization’s cloud data security footprint, fight policy drift and
misconfigurations that put data at risk, and continuously improve their security posture over time.

By adding DSPM capabilities to its CNAPP solution, Tenable will help customers identify key evidence related to cloud data
risk, including where sensitive data resides in the cloud, who has access to that data and the severity of the risk posed by
potential data compromise. This type of visibility is central to an organization’s ability to accurately assess its cloud
security compliance. In the 2024 Tenable Cloud Security Outlook study, 95% of organizations polled had experienced cloud-
related breaches in the previous 18 months. Among those, 92% reported exposure of sensitive data, and a majority
acknowledged being harmed by the data exposure.

“Eureka Security’s technology will enable Tenable to provide even better prioritization of cloud risks and identify toxic
combinations beyond vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and over-privileged access to include data at risk as well,” said
Shai Morag, senior vice president and general manager of Cloud Security, Tenable. “This is another example of how we’re
pushing the envelope in cloud security innovation for customers and leading the market forward by developing best-in-
class capabilities.”

“Eureka Security's data-centric approach provides the visibility, control and automation needed to navigate the dynamic
cloud landscape while ensuring the highest level of security and compliance,” said Liat Hayun, co-founder and CEO, Eureka
Security. “We're excited to join Tenable. Integrating our capabilities into Tenable’s CNAPP offering creates a compelling
capability for customers. Tenable also brings an expansive customer base, and strong go-to-market capabilities. We
couldn't have found a better match to help us expand our mission to reduce cloud data risk globally.”

The integration of DSPM will round out the current Tenable Cloud Security solution that already includes such key
capabilities as unified CNAPP, iron-clad CSPM protection, cloud workload protection and industry-leading CIEM, among
others, which will give security teams the context and prioritization guidance to make efficient and accurate remediation
decisions. The Eureka Security DSPM capabilities are expected to be natively integrated into Tenable Cloud Security and its
leading CNAPP solution later this year.

### Strategic Activity, Key Vendors, & Trends In The Email Security Market

Highlighting Strategic Activity, Selected Vendors, & Trends In The Email Security Market.

While companies have prioritized email security solutions for decades, analysts expect the
email security market to grow significantly in the coming years. Advanced threats relating to
phishing and social engineering necessitate strong email security to protect employee and
company data from threat actors.

According to Gartner’s inaugural magic quadrant for email security in 2024, Gartner’s analysts
listed several required features for modern email security solutions including phishing scanning,
attachment inspection and quarantine capabilities, URL analysis and inspection, and email
data protection.

Despite strategic activity in email security being somewhat limited, there have been several
recent landmark acquisitions in the space, demonstrating how established strategic vendors
have needed to bolster their solutions with innovative technologies.

### Key Performance Indicators For Evaluating Cyber Businesses

Highlighting Key Performance Indicators In Cybersecurity When Evaluating Businesses.

#### ARR Growth

Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) quantifies the predictable, subscription-based revenue a company can expect to earn on an annual basis.
ARR Growth speaks to the change in ARR over a specified period (often annual, as shown in the table above), and typically expressed as a
percentage. It's a key metric for subscription-based businesses, reflecting the company's capacity to expand its customer base or enhance
the value derived from existing customers through upsells or expanded offerings.

#### Gross Margin

Gross Margin represents the difference between a company’s revenue and the cost of goods sold (COGS), which is the cost of delivering and
maintaining its software-based product. Costs may include hosting, infrastructure, 3rd party software licenses, support, maintenance, direct
labor related to the delivery of the product, possibly even depreciation of capitalized software development costs. Gross Margin is often
expressed as a percentage of revenue, Gross Margin % = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue * 100%.

#### Burn Multiple

Burn Multiple offers insight into the relationship between a company's net cash burn and its net new revenue in any given period, typically
calculated as Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARR. This metric serves as a snapshot of the company’s financial sustainability, providing
an indication of how efficiently a company is utilizing its capital relative to its revenue. In other words, how many dollars will the company
burn to generate $1 of additional ARR? A lower Burn Multiple implies a more efficient utilization of capital for the company.

#### Magic Number

Similar to the LTV/CAC Ratio, the Magic Number metric assesses the efficiency of a company's sales and marketing spend in generating new
subscription revenue. The higher the Magic Number, the more effectively a company is utilizing its sales and marketing spend to facilitate
growth. The Magic Number is typically calculated as Magic Number = (Current Quarter ARR - Prior Quarter ARR) / (Prior Quarter Sales &
Marketing Spend)

### Key Performance Indicators For Evaluating Cyber Businesses

Highlighting Key Performance Indicators In Cybersecurity When Evaluating Businesses.

#### Gross Revenue
Retention (GRR)

Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) gauges the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers within a specified period
(typically last twelve months (LTM), as shown in the table above), excluding expansion or upsell revenue. It's indicative of a company's
ability to maintain existing revenue streams, offers insights into customer satisfaction and product market fit, and helps assess the stability
of a company's revenue from its current customer base.

#### Net Revenue
Retention (NRR)

Net Revenue Retention (NRR) gauges the percentage of recurring revenue generated from existing customers within a specified period
(typically LTM). Unlike GRR, NRR factors in not only down-sells and churn but also upsells and cross-sells. This metric provides a more
comprehensive view of customer revenue retention and expansion, and is indicative of a company’s ability to not only maintain but also
grow revenue within its existing customer cohort. Naturally, the higher the revenue retention rate, the greater the contribution existing
customers will make to the company's growth.

#### LTV / CAC

The Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost (LTV/CAC) ratio illustrates the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer and
the cost to acquire them. The ratio serves as a key indicator of the long-term profitability and sustainability of a company's customer
acquisition strategies, and helps assess whether the company is securing enough value from customers to justify the associated costs.

#### Rule of 40

The "Rule of 40" frequently surfaces in SaaS discussions as a metric that evaluates a company's balance between growth and profitability.
For a SaaS company to be considered "healthy," the sum of its growth rate percentage and its profit margin percentage should be equal to
