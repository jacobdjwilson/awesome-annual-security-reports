## Survey Method

The study was conducted online within 13 countries worldwide (USA, UK, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and New Zealand) by Dynata on behalf of Gen from March 6 to March 24, 2023 among 13,107 adults ages 18 and older, with a minimum of 1,000 respondents per country. Data are weighted where necessary by age, gender, and region, to be nationally representative.

Data are weighted where necessary to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population; India was weighted to the population of those who are online. Weighted variables varied by country and included one or more of the following: age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, internet usage, household size, household income, size of place, and propensity to be online. A global postweight was applied to ensure equal weight of each country in the global total.

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

## How to Spot Online Dating Scams

1. Ask for a recent photo to help verify the identity of the person that you’re talking to. If they protest or make excuses as to why they can’t provide a photo, it is best to err on the side of caution.

2. If they continually put off meeting in real life and you’ve been chatting up a potential sweetheart for a while, this could be a red flag.

3. Don’t visit links sent to you by people you haven’t talked to for very long. Scammers will pose as a member and try to get their target to click on links, usually leading to porn or webcam sites, and sometimes can even lead to malicious sites that download malware onto your computer. Norton Genie, a free AI-powered scam detection app, can help detect any malicious links in messages that scammers send.

4. If someone requests a webcam chat, be especially careful about your behavior. The criminal can record the webcam session and they can use it to blackmail you. If the conversation you’re having starts to take an uncomfortable turn, it’s okay to disconnect the chat.

5. If you notice that the conversation you’re having seems a bit off, or the person isn’t answering your questions directly, chances are it’s a bot. Scammers create fake profiles that are run by programs called bots. Their objective is to get you to click on a link that will lead to either porn, malware or scam you out of credit card information. It’s actually quite easy to spot a bot, as they have a set of predetermined “canned” responses.
