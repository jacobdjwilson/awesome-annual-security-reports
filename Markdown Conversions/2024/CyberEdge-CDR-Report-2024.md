## Introduction

CyberEdge’s annual Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR) plays a
unique role in the IT security industry. Other surveys do a great
job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches
and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad
actors. Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of
IT security professionals.

A decade after its first edition, the CDR has become a staple
among IT security leaders and practitioners by helping them
gauge their internal practices and security investments
according to those of their counterparts across multiple
countries and industries. If you want to know what your peers
in IT security are thinking and doing, this is the place to look.

CyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum
research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the
success of this report.

### Top Five Insights for 2024

Our CDR reports yield dozens of actionable insights. Here are
the top five takeaways from this year’s installment:

1.  **Confidence is building.** Several long-running trends
    have reversed in the last year or two. Survey data contains
    multiple indications that security professionals are becoming
    more confident about their ability to reduce the impact of
    cyberattacks. The percentage of organizations compromised
    by cyberattacks fell substantially from the previous survey
    (page 7), and our respondents expect the number to fall
    even more this year (page 9). We also saw improvements in
    our Threat Concern Index (page 18) and Security Concern
    Index (page 31). The former measures the overall level of
    concern about cyberthreats, and the latter measures the
    concern for inhibitors to IT security team success.

2.  **AI is taking center stage.** Artificial intelligence technologies
    are being incorporated into a very wide range of security
    solutions. They promise to increase the power of security
    professionals to detect and block attacks, respond to
    incidents, and find and remediate vulnerabilities. Security
    teams are looking at AI as a force multiplier that will make
    them more productive and effective (page 21). Survey
    respondents expect AI to be deployed in many ways to both
    enhance and defeat cybersecurity measures. A plurality
    thinks the positive and negative outcomes will be in balance.
    However, of the rest, significantly more believe the benefits
    to security teams will be greater than the benefits to threat
    actors, creating an overall “Advantage to Security” (page 25).

3.  **Ransomware trends are changing direction.** Several
    persistent trends related to ransomware have turned around.
    Compared to our last survey, significantly fewer respondents
    reported that their organization had been victimized by
    ransomware. The percentage of affected organizations
    paying ransoms declined, and so did the number of
    organizations that paid ransoms and managed to recover
    their data. The reasons for these changes are complex, but
    we think we have untangled some of the threads (page 27).

4.  **Funding for security groups is not a problem.** A record
    number of security groups expect their budget to increase
    this year, and the size of the average expected budget
    increase grew (page 35).

5.  **Cybersecurity experts are now sitting on boards.** We
    found that three out of five organizations have a member
    of the board of directors with cybersecurity experience.
    This has tremendous implications for the ways that security
    leaders and top executives interact (page 51).

## Section 1: Current Security Posture

### Past Frequency of Successful Cyberattacks

How many times do you estimate that your organization’s global network has been compromised
by a successful cyberattack within the past 12 months?

In the 2023 CDR report, we said that IT security teams may
have reached a turning point. After successful attacks increased
steadily year after year, the curve seemed to have flattened out,
and even started to reverse. Perhaps there is room for optimism,
we thought. Perhaps we are not doomed to an endless cycle of
bad news.

Well, our latest data strongly confirms that positive change in
direction. The percentage of organizations compromised at least once by a successful cyberattack in the previous 12 months
edged down from 86.2% in the 2021 CDR, to 85.3% in 2022, to
84.7% in 2023. In this survey, the decrease was more substantial,
falling 3.2% to 81.5% (see the blue bars in Figure 1). While that
is still high by historical standards, it shows that the tide has
definitely turned.

Even more striking, the percentage of organizations experiencing
six or more successful attacks dropped a whopping 11.2%, from
39.2% to 27.8% (see Figure 2 and the red bars in Figure 1). We
haven’t seen a figure that low since 2018.

It’s too early to start celebrating, though. Organizations of all
sizes are still exposed to thousands of low-level attacks every
day. The financial, regulatory, and reputational costs of data
breaches continue to rise. Ransom payments have soared as well
(see page 28). But cybersecurity professionals can take
satisfaction in the fact that they’re blocking more attacks than
in any year since 2020.

What is causing this turnaround? We suggest several factors:

*   A significant number of work-from-home (WFH) employees
    returning to offices, where their devices are better protected
    from cyberattacks.
*   The payoff from large investments in zero trust, cloud
    security tools, advanced authentication, extended detection
    and response (XDR), and other innovative cybersecurity
    technologies (see page 53).
*   More attention to basic security hygiene (vulnerability
    detection and patching), including investments in risk-based
    vulnerability management (RBVM) and cyber exposure
    management solutions.
*   Increased applications of AI and machine learning (ML)
    to cybersecurity tools (see pages 21-26).
*   More investment in security awareness training for users
    and professional training for cybersecurity staffs.
*   More-effective cooperation between government law
    enforcement agencies, industry groups, and individual
    enterprises.

It’s worth keeping in mind that mileage may vary. The prevalence
of successful attacks is not uniform across the globe or among
industries.

For example, you might want to think twice before accepting a
cybersecurity job in Mexico. A full 97% of organizations reported
at least one compromise last year, and about half (52%) suffered
six or more. Other countries where at least 85% of organizations
experienced a successful attack were South Africa (89.6%),
Colombia (87.5%), Spain (87.5%), and Brazil (85.3%). At the other
end of the spectrum, 75.5% of Australian organizations reported
one or more successful attacks, along with 72.9% of Japanese
and 70.0% of Italian organizations (see Figure 3).

Of the major industries tracked in our survey, financial
institutions suffered most frequently from successful attacks
(presumably “because that’s where the money is”), followed
by telecom & technology firms, while manufacturing and retail
were least affected (see Figure 4).

### Future Likelihood of Successful Cyberattacks

What is the likelihood that your organization’s network will become compromised
by a successful cyberattack in 2024?

The positive trend we noted in the previous section extends
to expectations for the coming year. The percentage of survey
respondents who think a successful attack in 2024 is somewhat
or very likely fell a substantial 5.1%, from 71.8% to 66.7%. The
decline over two years, from the 2022 report to this one, is 9.4%
(see the blue bars in Figure 5).

The pattern continues for those saying that one or more
successful attacks are very likely. Their number dropped
precipitously, from 32.9% to 21.2%.

These figures do raise an interesting question. If 81.5% of
organizations experienced at least one compromise last year
(Figure 1), is it reasonable that only 66.7% will undergo the
same fate this year (Figure 5)? Optimism is a good thing. As the
poet Alexander Pope wrote: “Hope springs eternal in the human
breast.” However, we think these forecasts involve a bit of
wishful thinking.

When breaking down the predictions by country, it is interesting
to note that those expecting the greatest number of successful
attacks this year are all in Asia: China (84.0%), Singapore (81.6%),
and Japan (79.2%) (see Figure 6). The least pessimistic are France
(58.9%), Italy (57.1%), and South Africa (46.0%).

And maybe you do want to accept that job in Mexico, at least
if you enjoy working with optimists. Although 97.0% of our
respondents in Mexico reported being compromised last year,
only 62.5% think the same thing will happen in 2024.

> “Optimism is a good thing. As the poet

> Alexander Pope wrote: ‘Hope springs eternal

>
> forecasts involve a bit of wishful thinking.”

When looking at organizations by size, the most worried
respondents come from large enterprises with 10,000-24,999
employees. Almost three-quarters of respondents in that group
(72.0%) expect one or more successful attacks.

Those in our other size categories, both smaller and larger, are
a touch more optimistic, falling in the 64%-67% range (see
Figure 7). We find that pattern in some of the other data as well.
Organizations in the 10,000-24,999 employee range make very
tempting targets for cybercriminals (for example, they have
the deep pockets to pay large ransoms), but don’t have quite
the ultra-sophisticated defenses and specialized cybersecurity
experts as the largest global enterprises.

### Security Posture by IT Domain

On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organization’s overall security posture
(ability to defend against cyberthreats) in each of the following IT components:

Cloud applications (SaaS) - 4.11
Servers (physical and virtual) - 4.08
Datastores (file servers, databases, SANs) - 4.07
Cloud infrastructure (IaaS, PaaS) - 4.05
Websites and web applications - 4.02
Laptops / notebooks - 4.01
Application program interfaces (APIs) - 4.01
Network perimeter / DMZ (public web servers) - 3.97
Internet of Things (IoT) - 3.97
Desktops (PCs) - 3.96
Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) - 3.94
Application containers (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) - 3.92
Industrial control systems (ICS) / SCADA devices - 3.88

![Figure 8: Perceived security posture by IT domain.](Image description)

We asked the survey respondents to rate their organization’s
ability to defend itself across 13 IT domains.

Our security professionals were most comfortable about the
security of SaaS applications, with a score of 4.11 (on a scale of
1 to 5, with 5 being the best possible security posture). This
reflects a high level of confidence in SaaS vendors and their
ability to protect cloud-based software. It’s also a nod to the
91.6% of organizations that have already deployed SaaS security
posture management (SSPM) solutions or are in the process of
doing so (see page 53).

Respondents are also relatively satisfied with defenses for servers
(4.08) and datastores such as file servers, databases, and storage
area networks (4.07). In fact, datastores is one of only three areas
where confidence increased from last year (more on that in
a minute).

At the opposite end of the list, industrial control systems (ICS)/
SCADA devices remained the area with the lowest score for
security posture (3.88). Security professionals continue to be
concerned about the potential for attacks on manufacturing
and operations technologies (OT), a lack of security solutions
for that realm, and the challenges of integrating OT security
with traditional data security. They may also be on edge because
of the potential for attacks on industrial infrastructure as an
outgrowth of national and regional conflicts (see page 59).

> workloads in Docker and Kubernetes containers.
>
> This trend likely reflects a combination of

> workloads by threat actors.”

A significant change from past years is the increase in concern
about protecting application workloads in Docker and
Kubernetes containers. This area fell from sixth place last year to
twelfth in this survey. In fact, the score for containers decreased
by 0.14, from 4.06 to 3.92, the biggest drop for any IT domain.
This trend likely reflects a combination of the growing use of
containerization for key applications and increased targeting of these
workloads by threat actors.

Speaking of lower scores, this year confidence in security posture
dropped in 10 of the 13 domains. That doesn’t mean that there
have been more successful attacks on those targets. Rather, it
implies that, in the continuing parallel arms races in different
areas of IT security, security professionals know they need to be
increasingly vigilant if they want to stay ahead of the bad guys.

On the other hand, there was one positive surprise. Internet of
Things (IoT) devices have been one of the top three areas of
concern for several years. In this survey, they fell back to fifth
from the bottom. Their score actually improved slightly from
last year, going from 3.95 to 3.97. This reflects the introduction
of new security solutions for IoT, as well as the ability of existing
security product vendors to monitor and protect IoT devices.

### Assessing IT Security Functions

On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organization’s capabilities
(people and processes) in each of the following functional areas of IT security:

Identity and access management (IAM) - 4.09
Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) - 4.09
Cyber risk quantification and reporting - 4.09
Security engineering / architecture and design - 4.08
Incident investigation and response - 4.08
Detection of advanced / sophisticated threats - 4.07
Attack surface reduction
(patch management, pen testing) - 4.05
Brand protection - 4.04
Application development and testing
(SDLC, DevSecOps) - 4.02
Detection of rogue insiders / insider attacks - 4.01
User security awareness / education - 4.01
Third-party risk management (TPRM) - 3.99

![Figure 9: Perceived adequacy of functional security capabilities.](Image description)

Confidence in the adequacy of defenses across functional areas
of IT security fell significantly this year, declining in 11 of the 12
categories tracked.

The decline in scores was moderate in the categories at the
top of the list. For example, the score for identity and access
management (IAM) fell from 4.13 to 4.09, but that function
continued in a tie for having the most satisfactory people and
processes (see Figure 9).

Two other areas of IT security moved way up on the list this
year. Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) and cyber risk
quantification and reporting jumped from sixth place and
eighth place, respectively, to a three-way tie for first with IAM.
Recently, enterprises have started putting a lot more emphasis
on GRC and risk quantification. Part of this focus is attributable
to evolving government regulations and industry standards
that demand better governance and risk management. Part is
due to CEOs and boards of directors now being held directly
accountable for cybersecurity incidents, and therefore getting
involved in IT security investment decisions. And part may be
a result of boards of directors now including members with
cybersecurity experience (see page 51).

However, the most striking finding for this question is the relative
loss of confidence in the adequacy of security capabilities for the
four functional areas at the bottom of the list.

Application development and testing (SDLC and DevSecOps) fell
from second place last year, with a score of 4.13, to ninth in this
survey, with a score of 4.02. Detection of rogue insiders dropped
from fourth (score: 4.13) to tenth (score: 4.01).

The bottom two items on the list only slipped one place
each from last year, but their scores declined significantly:
user security awareness and education from 4.08 to 4.01 and
third-party risk management (TPRM) from 4.07 to 3.99.

We don’t think that defenses in these functions have objectively
gotten worse, but security professionals are becoming more
concerned that they are falling behind the pace of innovation
shown by threat actors. Also, more organizations may have
recognized the increased importance of improving application
security, detecting insider attacks, educating users, and detecting
malware in purchased devices and software, and decided that
their existing defenses in these functions need improvement.

### The IT Security Skills Shortage

Select the roles/areas for which your organization is currently experiencing a shortfall
of skilled IT security personnel. (Select all that apply.)

The security skills shortage is persistent, widespread, and
consequential.

Our data indicates that the shortage of skilled IT security
personnel eased a touch over the last 12 months but remains
at high levels. As shown in Figure 10, the percentage of
organizations experiencing a shortfall in at least one role fell
slightly, from 86.6% to 85.8%, but that is still the third-highest
figure since we started asking this question.

A similar picture emerges when we look at specific jobs (see
Figure 11). For every security role in our survey, between a
quarter and just over a third of organizations have openings
they can’t fill.

IT security administrators are the most sought-after (there is a
shortfall in 35.4% of organizations). Close behind are IT security
analysts, operators, and incident responders (32.4%) and IT
security architects and engineers (32.3%). And almost as many
organizations have vacancies in the remaining roles: IT security
and compliance auditors (26.1%), DevSecOps engineers (25.6%),
risk and fraud analysts (25.0%), and application security testers
(24.6%). These numbers are all down from last year, but they are
roughly in line with the findings from our 2020 and 2021 reports.

We think the modest declines are related to the workforce
reductions in high-tech companies. Layoffs in large technology
firms, including Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Meta
(Facebook), Salesforce, LinkedIn, Discord, Snapchat, SAP, Spotify,
and others, have made the news. Also, many medium-size and
small businesses have cut staff to reduce expenses. Although
many are retaining their cybersecurity experts, not all have been
spared from the carnage.

> “Are tech industry layoffs a bad sign for security
>

>
> sign for hiring managers desperately trying to fill
>
> vacancies? We wouldn’t advise anyone to get too
>
> excited, at least in the short term, because there is
>
> still a massive deficit in qualified staff.”

Now, in the medium and long term, AI may have a significant
impact on the shortage by increasing the productivity of
cybersecurity workers, and perhaps even making some job
descriptions obsolete. We discuss that hypothesis in The Road
Ahead section of this report, on page 58.

Why did we say that the security skills shortage is consequential?
You can see the evidence on page 30, which shows that a lack
of skilled IT security personnel is currently the second-biggest
factor inhibiting organizations from adequately defending
themselves, second only to low security awareness among
employees. It has been the #1 or #2 factor for eight years now.

IT security personnel in at least one role.](Image description)

## Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns

### Concern for Cyberthreats

On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your overall concern for each of the following
types of cyberthreats targeting your organization:

Malware (viruses, worms, Trojans) - 3.89
Phishing / spear-phishing attacks - 3.87
Account takeover / credential abuse attacks - 3.81
Ransomware - 3.80
Denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks - 3.75
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) /
targeted attacks - 3.73
SSL-encrypted threats - 3.70
Web application attacks (SQL injections,
 cross-site scripting) - 3.68
Insider threats / data exfiltration by employees - 3.67
Attacks on brand and reputation in social media
 and on the web - 3.66
Drive-by downloads / watering hole attacks - 3.61
Zero-day attacks (against publicly
unknown vulnerabilities) - 3.61
Supply chain threats - 3.60

![Figure 12: Relative concern for cyberthreats.](Image description)

In every survey we ask our respondents to quantify their concern
about a range of cyberthreats. This year’s results provided more
data indicating that their attitudes have changed decisively in
a positive direction. Their overall level of concern decreased for
every one of the 13 cyberthreats included in the question.

The “big four” cyberthreats continued to be malware (with a score
of 3.89, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being extremely concerned),
phishing (3.87), account takeover and credential abuse attacks
(3.81), and ransomware (3.80) (see Figure 12). These were in the
same order as last year, except that phishing and account takeover
swapped the #2 and #3 spots.

However, the scores for account takeover attacks and ransomware
declined substantially compared to typical year-to-year
movements on this question. The score for account takeover
attacks fell by 0.14 and ransomware declined by 0.10.

Given the heavy press coverage of ransomware, this last figure
might seem surprising. But you can find the explanation on
pages 27-29. Although the median ransom amount increased
substantially last year, the percentage of organizations affected
by a ransomware attack, and the percentage paying a ransom,
both decreased.

Denial of service attacks, advanced persistent threats,
SSL-encrypted threats, web application attacks, insider threats, and
attacks on brand and reputation continued to be serious concerns,
with scores between 3.66 and 3.75. However, except for the first,
those scores declined between 0.08 and 0.13 from the last survey.
Denial of service attacks were the exception, down only 0.02.

What do these declines add up to? Every year we average the
concern scores for all the cyberthreat types into what we call our
Threat Concern Index. As shown in Figure 13, the overall concern
for cyberthreats has fallen for two years running, from a record
high of 3.88 in the 2022 CDR, to 3.82 in the 2023 edition, to 3.72
this year.

Last year we attributed the decrease in the Threat Concern Index
to workers returning to offices with more security in place than in
homes, increased investment by organizations in ML, AI, and other
advanced technologies, and the widespread implementation of
zero trust frameworks. We think those are still the primary drivers
of the more-positive attitude we see in this data.

![Figure 13: Threat Concern Index, depicting overall concern
for cyberthreats.](Image description)

### Concern for Web and Mobile Attacks

Which of the following attacks on your web and mobile applications are most concerning? (Select up to three.)

Account takeover / credential
stuffing attacks - 43.9%
Personally identifiable information
(PII) harvesting - 42.5%
Carding / payment fraud attacks - 36.0%
Digital skimming / Magecart attacks - 24.6%
Ad fraud - 22.2%
Denial of inventory attacks - 20.0%
Hoarding attacks - 17.0%

![Figure 14: Most-concerning web and mobile application attacks.](Image description)

Web and mobile application attacks are particularly menacing to
enterprises that transact business on the web and through mobile
apps, especially financial institutions and retailers that can lose
substantial sums to online fraud. But these attacks can affect any
organization that handles customer, client, or constituent data.
Threat actors employ web and mobile application attacks to steal
credentials and personal information, which they can then use to
impersonate victims to carry out data breaches, identity theft, and
other crimes. The problem is made worse when people reuse the
same passwords for multiple personal and work accounts.

We asked respondents to select the three web and mobile
application attacks that most concern them (or to say that their
organization is not affected by any of these attacks). The results
are shown in Figure 14.

What did we learn? In this group, the greatest concern today is
account takeover (ATO) and credential stuffing attacks, which
use stolen and leaked passwords and email addresses to break
into networks and applications. These were cited by 43.9% of the
respondents. This was a substantial increase from last year’s figure
of 40.2% (an increment of 3.7%, to be precise). The widespread
use of these attacks is prompting more consumer- and client-
facing organizations to adopt two-factor and passwordless
authentication methods, despite the added inconvenience to users.

Attacks that harvest personally identifiable information (PII)
moved down from first place in the last survey to second in this
one. However, the number of citations was essentially the same
(42.5% versus 42.3%), indicating that worries about these threats
have not abated.

The other five attack types maintained the same order as in the
last report. The biggest change was a reduction in the percentage
of respondents citing digital skimming and Magecart attacks,
which fell 4.8%, from 29.4% of organizations to 24.6%.

![Figure 15: Organizations affected by a web or mobile application attack.](Image description)

![Figure 16: Organizations affected by a web or mobile application attack,
by industry.](Image description)

We mentioned that web and mobile application attacks can
harm any organization that interacts with customers, clients, or
constituents. And that turns out to be nearly all of them. As shown
in Figure 15, 90.0% of organizations have been threatened by
these attacks.

In fact, when we break down results by line of business, the
distance between the most affected major industries – finance
and telecom & technology – and the least affected – education
and healthcare – is less than 9% (see Figure 16).

### Positive Outcomes of AI

Cybersecurity industry analysts predict that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), including machine
learning (ML) and generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT), will benefit IT security teams. Which of the following
positive outcomes of AI do you predict will impact your organization the most? (Select up to three.)

Improve our ability to detect /
block cyberthreats - 56.0%
Improve our ability to respond
to security incidents - 49.5%
Improve our ability to detect /
patch vulnerabilities - 49.0%
Improve workforce efficiency /
accomplish more with
fewer resources - 40.2%
Improve our ability to research
threat actors and their tactics - 40.2%

![Figure 17: Positive outcomes for security teams from AI.](Image description)

One of the hottest topics in technology right now is artificial
intelligence. People are wondering, will AI be a boon or a bane?
Will it become a valuable servant of humanity, or a malicious
overlord bent on destroying our species? And most important,
how will it affect my job?

We are just as curious as the next person, so we added a special
three-question section about AI to this survey. We asked how AI
technologies will enhance the work of security teams, how it will
be employed by threat actors, and whether on balance AI will
benefit security teams or threat actors more.

When asked to select the top three ways technologies such as
ML and generative AI will benefit IT security teams, the most
common response, by a wide margin, was “Improve our ability
to detect/block cyberthreats.” This was selected by 56.0% of our
respondents (see Figure 17). At a time when attack surfaces are
expanding and threat actors are bombarding our networks with
an endless variety of probes and assaults, defenders are looking
to AI to sort through mountains of hay to find, prioritize, and
where appropriate, swiftly block, the hidden needles.

![Figure 18: Belief that security teams will benefit from AI.](Image description)

In second place, selected by about half of respondents, is
“Improve our ability to respond to security incidents” (49.5%).
Incident response often involves s
