## Introduction

CyberEdge’s annual Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR) plays a unique role in the IT security industry. Other surveys do a great job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad actors. Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of IT security professionals.

A decade after its first edition, the CDR has become a staple among IT security leaders and practitioners by helping them gauge their internal practices and security investments according to those of their counterparts across multiple countries and industries. If you want to know what your peers in IT security are thinking and doing, this is the place to look.

### Top Five Insights for 2024

1. **Confidence is building.** Several long-running trends have reversed in the last year or two. Survey data contains multiple indications that security professionals are becoming more confident about their ability to reduce the impact of cyberattacks. The percentage of organizations compromised by cyberattacks fell substantially from the previous survey, and our respondents expect the number to fall even more this year.
2. **AI is taking center stage.** Artificial intelligence technologies are being incorporated into a very wide range of security solutions. Security teams are looking at AI as a force multiplier that will make them more productive and effective. A plurality thinks the positive and negative outcomes will be in balance; however, significantly more believe the benefits to security teams will be greater than the benefits to threat actors, creating an overall “Advantage to Security.”
3. **Ransomware trends are changing direction.** Compared to our last survey, significantly fewer respondents reported that their organization had been victimized by ransomware. The percentage of affected organizations paying ransoms declined, and so did the number of organizations that paid ransoms and managed to recover their data.
4. **Funding for security groups is not a problem.** A record number of security groups expect their budget to increase this year, and the size of the average expected budget increase grew.
5. **Cybersecurity experts are now sitting on boards.** We found that three out of five organizations have a member of the board of directors with cybersecurity experience. This has tremendous implications for the ways that security leaders and top executives interact.

### Survey Demographics
- Responses received from 1,200 qualified IT security decision makers and practitioners.
- All from organizations with more than 500 employees.
- Representing 17 countries across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.
- Representing 19 industries.

## Research Highlights

### Current Security Posture
- **Yes, some things are getting better.** The percentage of organizations compromised by successful attacks declined for the third consecutive year.
- **Crazy optimistic about 2024.** The percentage of security professionals who think a successful attack is likely or very likely has fallen by 9.4% over two years, to 66.7%.
- **ICS and IoT are concerns.** Respondents are confident in defending SaaS applications but worried about application containers and industrial systems.
- **Still can’t hire enough.** Despite recent layoffs at tech firms, enterprises still face a daunting shortage of experienced IT security people.

### Perceptions and Concerns
- **AI will help the good guys.** Respondents think AI technologies will be force multipliers for security teams.
- **Ransomware U-turns.** Fewer organizations were victimized, fewer ransoms were paid, and less data was recovered.
- **People problems.** The biggest barriers to successful cyber defense are low security awareness among employees and lack of skilled security personnel.

### Current and Future Investments
- **Security budgets are rising.** The mean annual increase in IT security budgets reached a record high of 5.7%.
- **A new king of the hill in network security.** Secure web gateways (SWG) replaced advanced threat protection products as the most frequently installed network security technology.
- **AD for ZT.** For the third year running, Active Directory protection tops the list of security management and operations technologies.

## Ten Years Behind Us – Looking Back on a Decade of CDR Data

> "And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun." – Pink Floyd

**Key Trends 2014-2024:**
- **Successful Attacks:** Rose steadily from 2014 (61.9%) to a peak in 2021 (86.2%), then began a downward trend to 81.5% in 2024.
- **Optimism vs. Reality:** In 2014, only 8.5% thought an attack was "very likely." By 2022, this rose to 32.9%. In 2024, it has settled at 21.2%.
- **Security Posture:** Confidence has moved up dramatically since 2014. The gap between the strongest and weakest domains has narrowed from 0.97 points to just 0.23 points.

---

## The Road Ahead

### AI Swords and Shields
AI will transform cyber battlegrounds. While it may automate some tasks, the cybersecurity skills shortage means it is more likely to bring supply and demand into balance rather than cause mass layoffs.

### New Regulations Taking Effect
- **SEC Rules (USA):** New disclosure requirements for material cybersecurity incidents.
- **PCI DSS v4.0:** New requirements for authentication and application protection.
- **NIS2 Directive (EU):** Expanded scope for cybersecurity rules and supply chain risk.
- **DORA (EU):** Digital operational resilience for financial institutions.

### Hot War, Cold War, Proxy War, Cyberwar
Active military conflicts are spilling over into cyberspace. Organizations should assess if they are "blast radius" targets due to their links to political, military, or infrastructure entities.
