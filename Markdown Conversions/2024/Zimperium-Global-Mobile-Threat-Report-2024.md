## Executive Summary

The exponential growth of mobile devices including mobile phones
and tablets that have access to critical business applications and
data has empowered and enabled workers and enterprises across
the world. However, evidence shows that security controls and
policies have not kept pace with the evolving threat that this may
pose. More than half of organizations(54%)in a recent study
experienced a data breach
due to employees' inappropriate
access to sensitive and confidential information on their mobile
devices. It seems that cybercriminals and other bad actors have
recognized the opportunity that lies within this new mobile-
focused environment.

1
  82%of organizations
allow BYOD

Organizations continue to strike a balance between Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and Corporate-
Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE).  According to Samsung about 15% of businesses issue mobile devices
to all employees, while 39% of companies rely fully on a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) approach. 2 The
remaining 46% of businesses take a hybrid approach, providing devices to some employees while
allowing others to use their own. This dual use, however, presents a high risk of data exposure and
enterprise infiltration due to the sophistication of mobile threats today which are beyond the capabilities
of traditional MDM and MAM solutions. Employees increasingly expect the flexibility to use mobile devices
for work, while businesses seek to maintain control over corporate data.

The ubiquitous nature of mobile applications on enterprise devices exacerbates this complexity. This
enterprise app footprint comprises apps developed in-house or from a third-party and personal apps
installed from the public store. Enterprise apps can be for employees, partners, or customers.  Having
both enterprise and personal apps on the same device create unique security risks. Enterprise apps
often handle sensitive corporate and customer data and may have vulnerabilities, particularly third-
party apps. Personal apps downloaded from public app stores can introduce malware or exploit
platform vulnerabilities, potentially compromising enterprise apps and in-app data.

Over 40,000 applications from these groups were reviewed,
and the top violations were Insecure Communication (76%)
and Insecure SSL/TSL (27%) on iOS. On Android, Leaky Storage
(53%), Insecure Communication (59%), and Dynamic Data
Leakage (31%) are major security issues.

Contrary to perception, app stores are not responsible for preventing every malicious app from getting in
or protecting apps from abuse. With more than 300 public app stores, 1,300 device manufacturers, and
constant OS updates, enterprise mobile device risk postures become very dynamic.  Because so few
enterprises prioritize the security of mobile apps and devices, this becomes the attack surface of choice.

Recognizing these vulnerabilities, attackers have adopted a “mobile first” attack strategy as mobile
presents a large, unsecured, and unmanaged attack surface for entry to the network and to corporate
data.

Mishing (Mobile-Targeted Phishing Attacks) - 83%
of phishing sites specifically targeted mobile devices

Application Vulnerabilities saw a surge in privacy
vulnerabilities around data storage, privacy controls and
app supply chain security  3

Mobile Malware - unique malware samples increased
by 13% over the previous year

Sideloaded Apps - threats from sideloaded apps are
dominated by riskware and trojans (which total 80%
of observed malware)

OS

Platform Risks - 14% of Android devices and 1% of iOS
devices monitored in today's enterprises cannot be
upgraded, leaving them susceptible to exploitation

Concentrating on these key areas allows enterprises to take decisive steps to neutralize the most
significant risks and protect their mobile environments from risks, threats, and attacks.

## The Enterprise Mobile Footprint

4

Enterprises are more mobile than ever
As of 2024, there are approximately 6.8 billion smartphone users worldwide. If we include all mobile
devices—such as tablets, feature phones, and wearables—the number exceeds 16 billion connected
mobile devices globally.  This figure reflects a world where many people own multiple mobile devices and
where the internet of things (IoT) is increasingly integrated into daily life. According to IDC,  nearly 60% of
the U.S. workforce today are mobile, frontline workers -- employees who don’t require a desk or an office to
do their work. This estimate includes both corporate-issued devices and personal devices used for work
purposes, as the majority of organizations believe that mobile is critical to enhancing worker productivity
and fostering business growth.  As a result, mobile workforces, remote work, and enterprise mobility
initiatives have grown exponentially, allowing mobile devices to access more data and interact with more
enterprise systems every year.

In addition to smartphone’s very large global use footprint the devices possess more processing power
than most of today’s PCs and are more powerful than mainframe computer NASA used to send astronauts
to the moon.

The number of apps has exploded.
Today, the work app footprint in enterprises is comprised of in-house developed apps, third-party
applications, and personal apps on work devices.

There are now around 1,889,653 Apple iOS applications, and 3,466,806 Android apps within their respective
app stores.  Add in the other 300 or more non-official stores and these numbers get even larger. A typical
smartphone user has at least 80 mobile applications installed,  with anywhere between 5 to 11 of these
being work apps pushed to their device by their employer.

7

These statistics provide a better understanding of how much our personal devices are used for work.

• 71% of employees leverage smartphones for work tasks.
• Over 60% of employees use their smartphones for work-related communication.
• 48% of employees use their smartphones for accessing work-related information.

Adopting mobile apps has tangible benefits, but enterprises should ask if they are really built to protect
their employees, sensitive data, and infrastructure. We analyzed over 40,000 of the most famous work
and non-work categories and apps to help get insights into this question. Let's look at the data.

These frameworks and regulations—MASVS, OWASP, NIAP, PCI, GDPR, and HIPAA—serve as important
security and privacy standards across different industries and regions. Running apps that violate
security frameworks like MASVS, OWASP, PCI, GDPR, or HIPAA on enterprise devices exposes businesses to
severe risks. These include cyberattack vulnerabilities, significant non-compliance fines, data breaches,
and privacy violations. Financial penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions can follow,
particularly when sensitive customer or financial data is compromised.

With the continued rise of no-code/low-code development approaches, developers will look to build
cloud-native apps up to 10 times faster than traditional coding while using up to 70 percent fewer
resources.  However, focusing on speed often means that best security practices are overlooked or
improperly implemented. This could lead to more exploitable apps being deployed into production
without the proper app protections and security testing, increasing the likelihood of data breaches and
compromised systems.

## How Prepared Are You for Mobile Risk
Mobile devices and their app footprint make them an easy target for attacks and require an effort to
secure them.  Use of the same device for work and personal use is not new.  This has been the case for
desktop and laptop computers for decades but mobile is different.

HERE IS WHY:

1. The devices are controlled by the end-user, not the enterprise IT
team. You can't really lock them down or force the user to update
software on their device.

2. There are an unlimited combination of mobile device hardware and
operating systems out there.  So each mobile device has a different
risk posture.

3. 85% of the apps on the device are personal apps and they all

impact the risk exposure to the enterprise.

Unlike traditional endpoints like desktops or laptops, mobile devices operate in a constantly shifting
environment, they are constantly exposed to unsafe networks—public Wi-Fi, harmful apps, and
phishing links, malware etc —exposing the enterprise to a variety of potential threats.

The question becomes:
Can your current security
framework handle this diversity
and unpredictability?

BYOD - Personal Devices For Work
Nearly 67% of employees use personal devices for work,  regardless of whether their
company has a formal bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy. Alarmingly, 70% of
businesses fail to adequately secure personal devices used for work purposes.  This
lack of security likely increases the actual risk, reinforcing the belief held by 55% of
professionals that smartphones are the most exposed endpoints in their organization.

Cyber Hygiene is Poor on Mobile Devices
User behavior often blurs the lines between work and personal activities, increasing the
chances of breaches when checking personal messages or emails on a work device or
using unsecured Wi-Fi networks. Notably, 71% of employees admit to engaging in
actions they knew were risky. 11 As noted above,  Zimperium research found 15% or more
of employees do not have a passcode enabled on their mobile devices.

AI-Powered Bad Actors
Bad actors increasingly leverage artificial intelligence
(AI) to discover new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities,
rapidly adapting their techniques to enhance attacks
on mobile devices that access enterprise networks.

Some of the most common uses of AI-driven attacks
include:

*   Automatic tailoring of phishing vectors (QR code,
    websites, URLs etc)
*   Automation of malware sample creation
*   Mutation of malware samples to avoid detection
*   Automatic tailoring of phishing emails and
    messages

## Threats Enterprises Must Prioritize

Despite the large number of mobile threats and risks, there are four that are paramount to tackle and
doing so will reduce risk from the rest. The four most important threats are:

i. Mishing: Mobile-Targeted Phishing Attacks

ii. Mobile Malware

iii. Sideloaded Apps

iv. Application Vetting and Protection for your users mobile apps

v. Platform Vulnerabilities

Here is a detailed look at each threat so we can better understand how it works and how we can defend
against it.

### From Phishing to Mishing!
In 2023, the Anti-Phishing Working Group reported nearly five million phishing attacks,  marking it the
worst year on record and surpassing the 4.7 million attacks seen in 2022. Zimperium’s zLABS threat data
aligns with this trend, underlining the increasing sophistication of phishing sites. Notably, 82% of
phishing sites examined by Zimperium specifically targeted mobile devices, delivering content
formatted for mobile, reflecting a 7% increase over the last three years.  25% of mobile users tapped on at
least one phishing link every quarter in 2019.

This trend underscores the growing number of phishing attacks targeting mobile users. Compared to
desktop systems, mobile devices often have fewer security measures in place. Users may not install security
software or be less likely to notice phishing attempts due to smaller screen sizes and less visible security
indicators, such as hidden URL bars.

of phishing sites using HTTPS now employ this protocol. This can give users
a false sense of security, leading them to believe the website is legitimate.

The four standard types of mobile targeted phishing attacks include Mobile-Targeted  Email Phishing,
Smishing, Vishing and Quishing. These four phishing attack methods go beyond tailoring emails to be
deceptive on the small screens of our mobile devices.  Three methods leverage the unique features of a
mobile device: text/sms features (Smishing) , voice features (Vishing)  and the fact that it is a camera
enabled device (Quishing). The fourth, Mobile-Targeted Email Phishing consists of an attack that is launched
via a standard email message, but only executes when a link (or attachment) is clicked by the user from a
mobile device. If clicked from a standard endpoint device such as a laptop, the attack is aborted.

Hence a new name is
needed that covers all four
of these phishing methods:

Mishing!

### The Struggle to Keep Up with Phishing
Phishing sites exemplify a hit-and-run approach in the digital threat landscape. These deceptive
domains are notorious for their rapid setup and equally swift disappearance, creating significant
challenges for cybersecurity defenses. Moreover, Zimperium reports that around one-quarter of
phishing sites become operable less than 24 hours after their creation, launching malicious
activities almost immediately. This quick deployment enables cybercriminals to reap substantial
rewards in a short time frame before the site vanishes or is taken down by authorities.

Following the trend of previous years, the US continues to lead the top countries hosting phishing
sites, accounting for 84% of such sites. This does not imply that most phishing attacks originate from
the US but rather that attackers are leveraging its infrastructure, such as hosting services or new
types of top-level domains, to carry out these activities.

Understanding this fast-paced lifecycle is key to developing countermeasures and protecting
sensitive information from being harvested. Attackers operate incredibly quickly and precisely,
hooking their prey and reaping the rewards as stolen credentials quickly lead to account takeovers.

Addressing this problem on mobile demands a reevaluation of current approaches and the
exploration of more dynamic and proactive measures.

# 14

Potential strategies might include:

*   Enhanced Detection Speed: Leveraging on-device detection
    techniques to identify phishing domains before they are clicked on.
*   Real-Time Blocking: Implementing systems that update URL
    blocking/filtering in real-time, minimizing the window during which
    sites can be accessed.
*   Public Awareness and Education: Increasing efforts to educate
    employees about the risks of phishing attacks and how to
    recognize suspicious links, reducing the success rate of such
    attacks.

Phishing ranks as the
second most expensive
attack, costing
organizations an

average of
$4.76 million USD
per incident.

According to the World Economic Forum,  the increase in mobile-connected devices and AI-driven
cyberattacks are key factors contributing to the growing vulnerability of critical infrastructure. The
proliferation of mobile devices and their use in accessing essential services make them prime targets for
ransomware,    leading to significant disruptions in critical sectors like healthcare, energy, and
transportation.

### Mobile Malware: Advanced Attacks

Think you’ve got mobile malware under control? Think again. With its widespread accessibility and
immense scale, malware has become the weapon of choice for nearly every cybercriminal. Mobile
malware rapidly spreads and extensively disrupts systems, with millions of unique variants and new
malicious apps emerging daily. According to a recent survey, when asked about their primary
cybersecurity concerns, 41% of CISOs cited malware, while 32% expressed concern about ransomware.
(Pulse).

ZiZimperium researchers analyzed over 859k malware samples detected in the wild.
On average, that equates to over 16,500 new malware samples a week. Remarkably, 72% of the malware
samples were completely unknown at the time of detection (not known to the free av engines),
highlighting Zimperium’s advanced capabilities in staying ahead of the curve when it comes to malware
identification and protection.

### Unsecured Networks
An unsecure network is a network that lacks adequate security
measures such as encryption, making it vulnerable to
unauthorized access and data interceptions. Connecting to these
networks is bad for business because it can lead to data
exfiltration, resulting in financial losses, legal liabilities, and access
to intellectual property.

In 2023, the number of devices connected to unsecured networks
increased by 45%. Zimperium found that on average, a mobile
device connects to a risky network 17 times in the span of a year.
Additionally other reports indicate that around 35% of individuals
access public WiFi three to four times a month and  four in 10 have
had their information compromised while using public WiFi. This
highlights that public WiFi is frequently used as a last resort when a
cell connection is unavailable, allowing people to stay connected
for leisure and work purposes.

Using public Wi-Fi while traveling poses a higher risk to online
security compared to usage at fixed locations. Among
respondents who had their online security compromised while
using public Wi-Fi, the highest percentage—23%—reported that
these incidents occurred at the airport.

Attackers can easily intercept traffic through man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks or lure employees into
using rogue Wi-Fi hotspots; it means they exploit vulnerabilities in network security to gain unauthorized
access to data being transmitted between devices and networks. Zimperium identified that 33% of
network threats are MiTM. In a MiTM attack, an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the
communication between two parties they believe are directly communicating with each other.

### Network Attacks by Region
With the rise of cloud-based services for mission-critical tasks, mobile devices have become
indispensable for business operations. Zimperium threat data shows that Europe, the Middle East, and
Africa (EMEA) experience the highest number of network attacks, with nearly 6% of iOS devices and 5% of
Android devices encountering such threats.

### An Early Warning Sign for Imminent Threats
Zimperium conducted a study on the security of Wi-Fi networks and rogue access points. The findings
indicate that when devices connected to these unsecure or rogue networks, iit took less than ten minutes
for malicious activities, such as
interception, unauthorized
access, or the installation of
malware to be detected on the
devices. This highlights the risk
associated with connecting to
unsecured networks and the
speed at which cyber threats
can compromise mobile
devices in such environments.

Network detections in EMEA have
quadrupled with malware occurring
at nearly double the rate.

## The Sideloading Saga

Sideloading is the practice of installing mobile apps on a device
that are not from the official app stores.
This is typically done on a rooted Android device or a jailbroken iOS device. With the blurring of personal and
professional boundaries, sideloaded apps are increasingly showing up on personal devices used for work.

Zimperium’s threat data shows that approximately one in four Android devices face this issue. While
sideloading is much more prevalent on Android, the recent Digital Markets Act (DMA) is expected to
increase its prevalence on iOS.

### Why Sideload Apps
With each sideloaded app, employees unknowingly expose their mobile devices or corporate ecosystems
to vulnerabilities by bypassing standard app stores such as Google Play.

Here are some reasons why users choose unofficial store apps:

*   To access apps unavailable in their region or banned.
*   To unlock features that are otherwise restricted.
*   To download free or cheaper games and movies.
*   To engage in illegal activities like bypassing Digital Rights Management (DRM).

.
In the most severe cases, sideloading apps can lead to a
complete mobile device compromise, granting remote attackers
full control. This could enable threat actors to access sensitive user
information, such as corporate information, credentials, or
personal information, and impersonate the user for unauthorized
access to banking accounts or other critical systems, among
other potential consequences.

APAC outpaces all
regions, with

43%of Android devices

sideloading apps.

### TOP 3 CATEGORIES OF
SIDELOADED MALWARE

Riskware
73%

Trojan
11%

General Purpose Malware
10%

Researchers at Zimperium found that riskware and trojans
are the most common malware families found in
sideloaded apps. As riskware often includes potentially
unwanted programs (PUPs) and adware, its high
occurrence indicates a broader spectrum of threats
beyond traditional malware. Additionally, trojans, known for
their deceptive nature in disguising themselves as
legitimate apps, present a persistent challenge in evading
detection and compromising device security.

Our research indicates that globally, users who engage in
sideloading are    200% more likely to have malware
running on their devices than those who do not. In fact,
sideloading is a great contributor to malware risk; in 8.3%
of cases where malware was detected, the source can be
traced back to a sideloaded application.

### Sideloaded App Attack Chain on Android
The following attack examples illustrate real instances where devices were tampered with following being
sideloaded. While sideloading an app may mark the first step in the attack chain, the true sequence often
begins months earlier when users enable device configurations that make the device vulnerable (such as
developer options, USB debugging, and installations from third-party sources.)
