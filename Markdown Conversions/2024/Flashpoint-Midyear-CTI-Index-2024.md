## Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities continue to be a rising threat vector as 2024 unfolds, as witnessed in the headlines and reflected in Flashpoint’s data. So far this year, vulnerabilities have risen by 11% and the availability of publicly known exploits has increased by 6%. To mitigate the risk of exploitation, organizations must continue to harden exposure management programs that prevent unauthorized access and the installation of malicious software such as infostealers and ransomware.

![Image description: A diagram titled "Actionable Severity Diagram" with three sections: "REMOTELY EXPLOITABLE" (10,591), "WITH PUBLIC EXPLOIT" (6,489), and "WITH ALL THREE" (2,863). A separate section shows "WITH SOLUTION" (12,680).](image_description_actionable_severity_diagram)

### Key Takeaways

*   Flashpoint aggregated and enriched 17,518 newly disclosed vulnerabilities in H1 2024.
*   936 of them were missed by CVE and NVD.
*   Over 45% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in H1 2024 are rated high to critical in CVSSv3. In order to prioritize effectively, organizations will need to avoid a top-down patching approach.
*   Vulnerability management teams can potentially reduce their critical vulnerability workloads up to 83% by focusing on remotely exploitable issues that have public exploits and a verifiable solution. However, given the current NVD slowdown, organizations will need a quality source of vulnerability intelligence for a comprehensive view.

## Information-Stealing Malware

Flashpoint has been observing a significant rise in the use of infostealer malware. It is simple, effective, easy to obtain, and inexpensive for threat actors to purchase. This has propelled infostealers to become an increasingly primary vector for ransomware and other high-impact data breaches.

### Key Takeaways

The United States remains the primary target for ransomware groups, followed by the United Kingdom and Canada. This sustained focus is driven by factors such as availability of high-profile targets, the potential for lucrative ransom payments, and overall challenges in dismantling sophisticated ransomware operations.

The technology industry was the most targeted industry for ransomware, followed by manufacturing. Technology firms are high-value targets because they provide critical infrastructure, while manufacturing companies combine access to important supply chain components with a tendency to rely on more outdated and vulnerable systems.

LockBit continues to be the most prolific ransomware group, claiming 428 victims in the first half of 2024.
