## Introduction

Here’s the reality.

In 2023, malicious email threats bypassing secure email gateways (SEGs) increased by more than 100%. In other words, your email security solutions aren’t stopping the threats you think they are.

We know because:
* We are the only email security company with a global network of 35+ million trained employees reporting suspected threats around the clock
* Our proprietary data provides unmatched industry insights with a 99.998% accuracy rate
* No one else has over a decade of insights and intelligence into the threats that EVERY SEG misses
* Last year we caught a malicious email EVERY MINUTE that bypassed our customers SEG

Security threats are real, they continue to grow, and they are likely to penetrate an organization through email. Organizations simply cannot settle for ‘Good Enough’ email security and sole reliance on a SEG is not enough. As we all know, it only takes one breach to damage a company’s financial status, brand reputation, and/or relationship with its employees and customers.

Each day, our analysts see thousands of threats that are bypassing all SEGs on the market.

That’s exactly why Cofense® has spent the last decade perfecting our phishing expertise, growing our network of Cofense-trained employees around the globe, and setting ourselves apart from the competition – simply put, we see and stop email threats that are missed by standard security controls before they do damage to an organization.

If you really want to know the current state of email security, you have come to the right place.

Let’s dive into the numbers.

## 2024 State of Email Security by the Numbers

Over the last 12 months, secure email gateways (SEGs) struggled to keep up with the evolving and sophisticated nature of today’s phishing campaigns.

We detected a malicious email bypassing our customers’ SEGs every minute.

Cofense saw a 104.5% increase in the number of malicious emails bypassing SEGs, per customer.

+67% Credential phishing was the threat of choice in 2023, with a 67% increase in volume compared to 2022.

Email is still the #1 threat vector for cybercrime, with 90% of data breaches starting with a phish.

Phishing campaigns are evolving with an increase in tactics like vishing, smishing, brand impersonation, and QR code phishing that bypass SEGs. Cofense reported a 331% increase in QR code active threat reports in 2023.

## 2024 State of Email Security

OVER THE LAST YEAR, cybersecurity threats continued to increase, with email acting as the primary threat delivery mechanism for attacks. With this increase, the need for rapid and actionable intelligence is mission-critical to protecting an organization from cyber criminals.

Uniquely powered by more than 35 million Cofense-trained employees, our phishing detection and response (PDR) solution detected a record-setting number of malicious emails and phishing campaigns that were missed by secure email gateways (SEGs).

In just two years, Cofense PDR uncovered almost 800 thousand unique malicious email campaigns with over 1.5 million emails detected worldwide. We have seen significant jumps in detected malicious emails year over year, and throughout the two years of data represented. Raw numbers of detected emails indicate 2023 had a 37% increase over 2022 and a 310% increase over 2021.

### Cofense Auto-Quarantine Summary

*   **Unique Email Campaigns Identified**: 770,892
*   **Total Malicious Emails Identified**: 1,577,041

SEGs only capture a small portion of malicious threats. The rest make it to your inbox. Stay secure with advanced security measures.

After a record-setting year, industry-specific SEG misses were all up across the board. Two of the most targeted industries in recent years, finance and healthcare, were once again key on threat actors’ lists. But, new industries were key targets in 2023 with real estate and management seeing dramatic increases in malicious emails.

*This data is based on the percent change from 2022 to 2023 per Cofense customer, per industry.

This year, credential phishing threats increased by 49% over 2022, which was already showing a large increase over 2021 data. In 2023, credential phishing was responsible for 91% of active threat reports (ATRs) published, with malware lagging significantly behind. Based on this data, we conclude that credential phishing was the threat of choice in 2023.

### Malicious Threats Observed by PDC

*   **BEC**: 8%
*   **Credential Phishing**: 57%
*   **Malware**: 32%
*   **Threat Unavailable**: 3%

The top themes in ATRs remain similar to last year, with finance themes and notifications securing the top two spots at 48% and 33% respectively. Cofense also saw a new theme, travel assistance, emerge. Travel assistance is a small contributor at 2% but one to watch going forward.

### Top Themes in Active Threat Reports

*   **Finance**: 48%
*   **Notification**: 33%
*   **Shipping**: 7%
*   **Document**: 4%

ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE the power of simplicity when it comes to phishing attacks. While we often hear about highly advanced and devastating cyberattacks, the truth is that many of them start with basic phishing campaigns. These campaigns may seem unrelated to more sophisticated threats, but they can still serve as a gateway to serious breaches.

## Email Security Trends to Watch – The Details

THE CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE IS ALWAYS EVOLVING, so it is imperative to stay on top of the latest trends and tactics. To learn more about what our intelligence revealed, here’s a deep dive into the email security trends you need to stay on top of in 2024.

### Credential Theft Phishing Leads as Top Threat Vector

As we look to the future of cyber threats, it’s clear that credential phishing will remain a top concern. The Cofense team identified that 91% of active threat reports published in 2023 centered around credential phishing, a 67% increase in volume compared to the year prior.

This sophisticated form of attack often involves convincing individuals to give up their login information or other sensitive data, which can then be used to gain access to secure systems and networks.

Cofense reported a 67% increase in credential theft phishing volume over 2022.

Not only can credential phishing lead to devastating ransomware attacks and data breaches, but it can also pave the way for business email compromise (BEC) schemes that defraud companies out of millions of dollars. As we move into 2024 and beyond, organizations must take this threat seriously and work to implement robust security protocols that can protect against all forms of credential phishing like vishing, smishing, QR code phishing, and other dangerous cyber-attacks.

### Use of QR Codes in Phishing Campaigns is Rapidly Increasing

QR codes in the phishing threat landscape are a major topic of interest and worth paying close attention to. QR codes change the attack vector and enable threat actors to trick victims into using their smartphones, which are typically not protected by enterprise controls and are therefore more vulnerable. Over the last year, Cofense reported a 331% increase in QR code ATRs issued.

As campaigns using QR codes grow in size and complexity, it is important to track not just the QR codes themselves, but also the context of the emails delivering the QR codes. Some of the emails bearing QR codes are delivered in attached files like HTM, PDFs, or Word documents. Others use images embedded in the email or QR codes rendered from external sources. The more recent QR code campaigns utilize a wide range of email themes rather than the earlier campaigns that primarily used multi-factor authentication as a lure for victims.

*   When it comes to the URLs from the actual QR codes, there are many different characteristics, such as their purpose as a legitimate redirect, a link shortener, etc. or the fact that one of the redirect pages makes use of a Cloudflare CAPTCHA.
*   The most common characteristics associated with URLs embedded in QR codes were CAPTCHA, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and URLs that had an open redirect to a credential phishing page.
*   The most common sources of QR codes are either a code embedded in the email content or an attached .pdf, .htm, or .doc file.
*   The subject of QR code emails was likely to be MFA themed, containing date and personally identifiable information that was redacted.
*   The types of URL domains embedded in QR codes were malicious or compromised, legitimate, QR code related, and a standard link shortener service.
*   Legitimate domains of URLs embedded in QR codes were Bing, Google, Baidu, and 5 other minor sources.

Cofense reported a 331% increase in QR Code Active Threat Reports (ATRs) issued.

Cofense was the first to alert the market about this growing threat early in 2023 and in Q4 2023, announced a first-of-its-kind solution that provides world-class security awareness training (SAT) and threat detection & response capabilities to specifically target QR code phishing threats.

### Threat Actors Lure Victims with Brand Impersonation and Vishing Campaigns

Brand impersonation and vishing campaigns are techniques used by threat actors to deceive victims into clicking on malicious links or providing sensitive information. In brand impersonation attacks, cybercriminals use the name, logo, and other branding elements of a reputable company to trick victims into believing the communication is legitimate. Once they gain the trust of their victims, they exploit this relationship to carry out their malicious activities.

Vishing campaigns, on the other hand, often start with email but involve using voice calls or automated phone messages to manipulate victims into providing confidential information. The attackers may pose as representatives of a trusted organization or financial institution and use social engineering tactics to gain access to personal data such as login credentials or credit card numbers. Vishing attacks are becoming increasingly popular due to the ease of accessing personal information through phone numbers and the widespread use of smartphones.

*   **Brand Impersonation**: Cybercriminals use the name, logo, and other branding elements of a reputable company to trick victims into believing the communication is legitimate.
*   **Vishing**: Often start with email, and then voice calls or automated phone messages to manipulate victims into providing confidential information.

Cofense saw both of these tactics on the rise in 2023. Both vishing and brand impersonation tactics are very efficient at bypassing SEGs; they are often delivered without attachments or obvious links making it difficult for traditional file and text-based detection software to pick up on these forms of phishing. Additionally, because users interact with these tactics via non-traditional methods like personal smartphones and traditional telephones, these types of phishing take users outside the protections of their corporate environment and its security protocols.

We believe that the best way to secure your organization from these types of attacks is to implement a complete end-to-end email security solution. We recommend a holistic solution that combines Security Awareness Training and Threat Detection and Response to identify malicious threats quickly and stop them before they become detrimental to your company’s data security while conditioning your employees to identify and report these types of malicious attacks. In 2023, Cofense introduced new simulation training to its SAT offering specifically focused on vishing and brand impersonation phishing tactics.
