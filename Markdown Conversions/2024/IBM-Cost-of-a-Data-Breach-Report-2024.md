## Executive summary

IBM’s annual Cost of a Data Breach Report provides IT, risk management and security leaders with timely, quantifiable evidence to guide them in their strategic decision-making. It also helps them better manage their risk profiles and security investments. This year’s report—the 19th of the series—reflects changes caused by technological shifts, such as the rise of shadow data, which is data residing in unmanaged data sources, and the extent and costs of business disruption brought about by data breaches.

The report’s research—conducted independently by Ponemon Institute and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM—studied 604 organizations impacted by data breaches between March 2023 and February 2024. Researchers looked at organizations across 17 industries, in 16 countries and regions, and breaches that ranged from 2,100 to 113,000 compromised records. To gain on-the-ground insights, Ponemon Institute researchers interviewed 3,556 security and C-suite business leaders with firsthand knowledge of the data breach incidents at their organizations.

## What’s new in the 2024 report

Each year, we continue to evolve the Cost of a Data Breach Report to reflect new technologies, emerging tactics and recent events. For the first time, this year’s research explores:

- Whether organizations experienced long-term operational disruption, for example, the inability to process sales orders, a complete shutdown of production facilities, ineffective customer services
- Whether the breach included data stored in unmanaged data sources, otherwise known as shadow data
- To what extent organizations are using AI and automation in each of 4 areas of security operations: prevention, detection, investigation and response
- The nature of extortion attacks, for example, extortion and ransomware attacks or extortion and data exfiltration only
- The time it takes to restore data, systems or services to their pre-breach state
- How long it took organizations to report the breach if they were mandated to do so
- Whether organizations that involved law enforcement following a ransomware attack paid the ransom

The result is a benchmark report that business and security leaders can use to strengthen their security defenses and drive innovation, particularly around the adoption of AI in security and security for their generative AI (gen AI) initiatives.

We lead this year’s report with 2 major developments. First, the global average cost of a data breach increased 10% over the previous year, reaching USD 4.88 million, the biggest jump since the pandemic. Business disruption and post-breach customer support and remediation drove this cost spike. When asked how they’re dealing with these costs, more than half of organizations said they are passing them on to customers. Having customers absorb these costs can be problematic in a competitive market already facing pricing pressures from inflation.

Second, on the defender side of the equation, researchers also found applying security AI and automation is paying off, lowering breach costs in some instances by an average of USD 2.2 million. AI and automation solutions are reducing the lifespan needed to identify and contain a breach and its resulting damage. Put another way, defenders without AI and automation to assist them can expect to take longer to detect and contain a breach, and see costs rise compared to those who use these solutions.

As we’ve seen across the industry, cybersecurity teams are consistently understaffed. This year’s study found more than half of breached organizations faced severe security staffing shortages, a skills gap that increased by double digits from the previous year. This lack of trained security staff is growing as the threat landscape widens. The continuing race to adopt gen AI across nearly every function in the organization is expected to bring with it unprecedented risks and put even more pressure on these cybersecurity teams.

This report provides insights and recommendations from the research to help reduce the potential financial and reputational damages from a data breach.

## Key findings

The key findings described here are based on IBM analysis of research data compiled by Ponemon Institute.

- **Average total cost of a breach**: The average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4.88 million from USD 4.45 million in 2023, a 10% spike and the highest increase since the pandemic. A rise in the cost of lost business, including operational downtime and lost customers, and the cost of post-breach responses, such as staffing customer service help desks and paying higher regulatory fines, drove this increase. Taken together, these costs totaled USD 2.8 million, the highest combined amount for lost business and post-breach activities over the past 6 years.
- **Cost savings from extensive use of AI in prevention**: 2 out of 3 organizations studied stated they’re deploying security AI and automation across their security operations center, a 10% jump from the prior year. When deployed extensively across prevention workflows—attack surface management (ASM), red-teaming and posture management—organizations averaged USD 2.2 million less in breach costs compared to those with no AI use in prevention workflows. This finding was the largest cost savings revealed in the 2024 report.
- **Growth of the cyber skills shortage**: More than half of breached organizations are facing high levels of security staffing shortages. This issue represents a 26.2% increase from the prior year, a situation that corresponded to an average USD 1.76 million more in breach costs. Even as 1 in 5 organizations say they used some form of gen AI security tools—which are expected to help close the gap by boosting productivity and efficiency—this skills gap remains a challenge.
- **Share of breaches involving shadow data**: 35% of breaches involved shadow data, showing the proliferation of data is making it harder to track and safeguard. Shadow data theft correlated to a 16% greater cost of a breach. Researchers found storing data across environments proved to be a common storage strategy, accounting for 40% of breaches. These breaches also took longer to identify and contain. In contrast, data stored in just 1 type of environment was breached less often, whether that environment was public cloud (25%), on premises (20%) or private cloud (15%).
- **Average cost of a malicious insider attack**: Compared to other vectors, malicious insider attacks resulted in the highest costs, averaging USD 4.99 million. Among other expensive attack vectors were business email compromise, phishing, social engineering and stolen or compromised credentials. Gen AI may be playing a role in creating some of these phishing attacks. For example, gen AI makes it easier than ever for even non-English speakers to produce grammatically correct and plausible phishing messages.
- **Share of breaches involving customer personal data**: Nearly half of all breaches involved customer personal identifiable information (PII), which can include tax identification (ID) numbers, emails, phone numbers and home addresses. Intellectual property (IP) records came in a close second (43% of breaches). The cost of IP records jumped considerably from last year, to USD 173 per record in this year’s study from USD 156 per record in last year’s report.
- **Cost savings when law enforcement is involved in ransomware attacks**: Ransomware victims that involved law enforcement ended up lowering the cost of the breach by an average of nearly USD 1 million, and that excludes the cost of any ransom paid. Involving law enforcement also helped shorten the time required to identify and contain breaches from 297 days to 281 days.
- **Days to identify and contain breaches involving stolen credentials**: Breaches involving stolen or compromised credentials took the longest to identify and contain (292 days) of any attack vector. Similar attacks that involved taking advantage of employees and employee access also took a long time to resolve. For example, phishing attacks lasted an average of 261 days, while social engineering attacks took an average of 257 days.
- **Largest average cost increase among all industries**: The industrial sector experienced the costliest increase of any industry, rising by an average USD 830,000 per breach over last year. This cost spike could reflect the need for industrial organizations to prepare for a more rapid response, as organizations in this sector are highly sensitive to operational downtime. Still, the time to identify and contain a data breach at industrial organizations was above the median industry, at 199 days to identify and 73 days to contain.

## Global highlights

Globally, security teams are doing a much better job of detecting and containing breaches, despite a stubborn skills shortage. More than half of breached organizations are facing security staffing shortages, and security leaders are, in turn, marshalling AI and automation solutions to close the skills gap. Despite their efforts, breach costs are rising, mostly from expenses related to business disruption and post-breach responses. In the following section, we look at these issues and others, across industries, countries and regions, to provide security leaders with a view of the risks out there so you can learn from them.

### The global average cost of a data breach spiked

The global average cost of a data breach increased 10% in one year, reaching USD 4.88 million, the biggest jump since the pandemic. Business disruption and post-breach response activities drove most of this yearly cost increase. See Figure 1.

![Figure 1. Global average total cost of a data breach, measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_1)

### The United States led the world in average breach cost

For the 14th year, the United States had the highest average data breach cost—USD 9.36 million—among the 16 countries and regions studied. Rounding out the top 5 were the Middle East, Germany, Italy and Benelux. Benelux is the economic union of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and it’s a new addition this year. Notably, Canada and Japan saw average costs drop, while Italy and the Middle East saw significant increases. See Figures 2A and 2B.

**Cost of a data breach by country or region**

| # | Country        | 2024    | 2023    |
|---|----------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | United States  | $9.36   | $9.48   |
| 2 | Middle East    | $8.75   | $8.07   |
| 3 | Benelux        | $5.90   | —       |
| 4 | Germany        | $5.31   | $4.67   |
| 5 | Italy          | $4.73   | $3.86   |

### Healthcare topped industry costs, again

The average breach cost for healthcare fell 10.6%, to USD 9.77 million. But that factor wasn’t enough to remove it from the top costliest industry for breaches—a spot it’s held since 2011. Healthcare remains a target for attackers since the industry often suffers from existing technologies and is highly vulnerable to disruption, which can put patient safety at stake. See Figure 3.

![Figure 3. Cost of a data breach by industry, measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_3)

### Average time to identify and contain a breach fell

The mean time it took defenders to identity and contain a breach dropped to 258 days, reaching a 7-year low, compared to 277 days the previous year. Note: this global average of mean time to identify (MTTI) and mean time to contain (MTTC) excludes Benelux because, as a new region in the study, it was having outsized influence and skewed results much more than the average. See Figure 4.

![Figure 4. Time to identify and contain a data breach, measured in days](placeholder_for_figure_4)

### Lost business costs and post-breach response costs soared

Costs from lost business and post-breach response rose nearly 11% over the previous year, which contributed to the significant rise in overall breach costs. Lost business costs include revenue loss due to system downtime, and the cost of lost customers and reputation damage. Post-breach costs can include the expense of setting up call centers and credit monitoring services for impacted customers, and paying regulatory fines. See Figure 5.

![Figure 5. Average cost of a data breach in 4 components, measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_5)

### Most breaches involved customer PII

The most common type of data stolen or compromised was customer PII, at 46%. PII can include tax ID numbers, emails and home addresses, and can be used in identity theft and credit card fraud. The global average for all stolen record types rose to a high of USD 169, with employee PII the costliest. See Figures 6A and 6B.

**Type of data compromised by percentage**

| Data Type              | 2024  | 2023  |
|------------------------|-------|-------|
| Customer PII           | 46%   | 48%   |
| Intellectual property  | 43%   | 34%   |
| Employee PII           | 37%   | 40%   |
| Other corporate data   | 31%   | 21%   |
| Anonymized customer data (non-PII) | 24%   | 26%   |

![Figure 6A. More than 1 response permitted](placeholder_for_figure_6A)

**Per-record cost of a data breach by type of record compromised**

| Record Type            | 2024  | 2023  |
|------------------------|-------|-------|
| Customer PII           | $183  | $173  |
| Intellectual property  | $181  | $156  |
| Employee PII           | $179  | $171  |
| Other corporate data   | $189  | $168  |
| Anonymized customer data (non-PII) | $132  | $138  |

![Figure 6B. Measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_6B)

## Initial attack vectors and root causes

For the 2nd year in a row, phishing and stolen or compromised credentials were the 2 most prevalent attack vectors. Both also ranked among the top 4 costliest incident types. In addition to identifying the most common root causes for breaches, the study compared the average cost for each category, as well as the average time to identify and contain those breaches.

### Compromised credentials topped initial attack vectors

Using compromised credentials benefited attackers in 16% of breaches. Compromised credential attacks can also be costly for organizations, accounting for an average USD 4.81 million per breach. Phishing came in a close second, at 15% of attack vectors, but in the end cost more, at USD 4.88 million. Malicious insider attacks cost the most, at USD 4.99 million, but were only 7% of all breach pathways. See Figure 7.

![Figure 7. Cost and frequency of a data breach by initial attack vector, measured in USD millions; percentage of all breaches](placeholder_for_figure_7)

### Credential-based attacks took longer to identify and contain

Whether credentials were stolen or used by malicious insiders, attack identification and containment time increased, yielding an average combined time of 292 and 287 days respectively. Defenders needed to distinguish between legitimate and malicious user activity on the network, making threats harder to identify. On the other hand, attacks using zero-day vulnerabilities were the most time-consuming to contain. See Figure 8.

![Figure 8. Top 5 categories in response time, measured in days](placeholder_for_figure_8)

### IT failures or human error caused nearly half of all breaches

Malicious attacks—those committed by outside attackers or criminal insiders—made up 55% of all breaches. As concerning as these breaches are, it’s important to remember the remaining 23% are due to IT failure and 22% are due to human error. See Figure 9.

![Figure 9. Root cause of the data breach between 3 categories](placeholder_for_figure_9)

## Data breach lifecycle

In a data breach, time means money, and breaches with longer lifecycles were more costly, according to our 2024 and 2023 research. A complete breach lifecycle is the combination of the average number of days to identify and contain a breach. In both reports, we compared the average costs of data breaches where the complete breach lifecycle was under 200 days to the average cost of breaches where complete lifecycles exceeded 200 days.

### Longer breach lifecycles led to higher costs

In this year’s report, researchers found data breaches with a lifecycle exceeding 200 days had the highest average cost, at USD 5.46 million, compared to breaches with lifecycles under 200 days. These findings are consistent with those from the previous year. Notably, while costs for longer data breach lifecycles increased 10.3% this year over last year, costs for shorter lifecycles also increased, but by a smaller amount, 3.6%. See Figure 10.

![Figure 10. Cost of a data breach based on the breach lifecycle, measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_10)

## Identifying the breach

To contain a data breach, it needs to be identified first. Who identifies it, and how quickly, make a difference in the resulting data breach costs. This year, we found security teams working with their own tools improved their performance in this area. In other cases, breaches were identified by benign third parties, such as security researchers, law enforcement and consultants, or the attackers themselves.

### Security teams identified most breaches

Security teams and their tools detected breaches far more often, at 42% of the time, than did benign third parties, at 34%, and attackers themselves, at 24%. This figure was an improvement over the 2023 report when security teams discovered breaches only one-third of the time. The change shows security teams were able to speed up detection. See Figure 11.

**How was the breach identified?**

| Identification Method        | 2024  | 2023  |
|------------------------------|-------|-------|
| Organizations’ security teams and tools | 42%   | 33%   |
| Benign third party           | 34%   | 40%   |
| Disclosure from the attacker | 24%   | 27%   |

![Figure 11. Only 1 response permitted](placeholder_for_figure_11)

### Breaches disclosed by attackers cost more

By the time an attacker discloses a breach, they’ll likely have already achieved their objective and done considerable damage, raising the overall costs of the breach. When a breach was disclosed by an attacker, the average cost was USD 5.53 million. On the other hand, when a security team identified a breach, the average cost was USD 4.55 million. See Figure 12.

![Figure 12. Cost of a data breach by how the breach was identified, measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_12)

### Faster breach identification and containment

The report found regardless of how a breach was discovered, organizations identified and contained them more quickly on average in 2024 than the previous year. The use of AI and automation likely contributed to this acceleration, as the next section of this report shows. See Figure 13.

![Figure 13. Time to identify and contain a breach by how the breach was identified, measured in days](placeholder_for_figure_13)

## Security AI and automation

AI and automation are transforming the world of cybersecurity. They make it easier than ever for bad actors to create and launch attacks at scale and provide defenders with new tools for rapidly identifying threats and automating responses to those threats. This year’s report found these technologies accelerated the work of identifying and containing breaches and reducing costs.

### AI and automation use grew

The number of organizations that used security AI and automation extensively grew to 31% in this year’s study from 28% last year. Although it’s just a 3 percentage point difference, it represents a 10.7% increase in use. The share of those using AI and automation on a limited basis also grew from 33% to 36%, a 9.1% increase. See Figure 14.

![Figure 14. State of security AI and automation comparing 3 usage levels, percentage of organizations per usage level](placeholder_for_figure_14)

### More AI and automation meant lower breach costs

The more organizations used AI and automation, the lower their average breach costs. That correlation is striking and one of the key findings of this year’s report. Organizations not using AI and automation had average costs of USD 5.72 million, while those making extensive use of AI and automation had average costs of USD 3.84 million, a savings of USD 1.88 million. See Figure 15.

![Figure 15. Cost of a data breach by AI and automation usage level, measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_15)

### More AI equaled faster identification and containment

Organizations extensively using security AI and automation identified and contained data breaches nearly 100 days faster on average than organizations that didn’t use these technologies at all. See Figure 16.

![Figure 16. Time to identify and contain a data breach by AI and automation usage level, measured in days](placeholder_for_figure_16)

### Security teams applied AI and automation evenly across functions

Among organizations that stated they used AI and automation extensively, about 27% used AI extensively in each of these categories: prevention, detection, investigation and response. Roughly 40% used AI technologies at least somewhat. See Figure 17.

![Figure 17. How much AI and automation did you use in 4 security categories? From the respondents that reported extensive use of AI and automation; reference chart 14](placeholder_for_figure_17)

### Extensive use of AI and automation lowered costs

When AI and automation were used extensively in each of the 4 areas of security, it dramatically lowered average breach costs compared to organizations that didn’t use these technologies in those areas. For example, when organizations used AI and automation extensively for prevention, their average breach cost was USD 3.76 million. Meanwhile, organizations that didn’t use these tools in prevention saw USD 5.98 million in costs, a 45.6% difference. See Figure 18.

![Figure 18. Cost of a data breach based on where AI and automation are deployed in security operations. From the organizations that reported extensive use of AI and automation, measured in USD millions; reference chart 14](placeholder_for_figure_18)

### AI and automation accelerated the time to identify and contain a breach

Wherever AI and automation were applied, they accelerated the work of identifying and containing breaches. Extensive use of AI and automation in any security function—prevention, detection, investigation or response—reduced the average MTTI and MTTC for data breaches by 33% for response and 43% for prevention. See Figure 19.

![Figure 19. Time to identify and contain a data breach based on where AI and automation are deployed in security operations. From the organizations that reported extensive use of AI and automation, measured in days; reference chart 14](placeholder_for_figure_19)

## Raising prices post-breach

By their nature, data breaches are expensive. When organizations find themselves saddled with multimillion-dollar costs, they may look to recoup those costs elsewhere. One option is to pass them along to their own customers in the form of price hikes, which is an increasing trend. Raising prices can be risky in a market already facing pricing pressure.

### Organizations passed breach costs to customers

Most organizations said they planned to increase prices of goods and services following a data breach, passing costs along to customers. The share of organizations that planned to do so increased to 63% this year from 57% last year, representing a 10.5% increase. See Figure 20.

![Figure 20. Did the data breach result in your organization increasing the cost of its products and services? Share of all organizations](placeholder_for_figure_20)

## Business disruption

Business runs on data. When data is breached, business is disrupted. These disruptions can vary from small breaches that affect only a few systems to long-lasting, organization-wide, operational shutdowns. Our research explored how minor or significant those disruptions were, and how the severity of a disruption correlated with data breach costs.

### Business disruption was substantial

70% of organizations in this year’s study experienced a significant or very significant disruption to business resulting from a breach. Only 1% described their level of disruption as low. See Figure 21.

![Figure 21. What level of business disruption did you experience because of the data breach? Only 1 response permitted](placeholder_for_figure_21)

### Average cost of a breach increased with disruption

Average breach costs were higher when business disruption was greater. Even organizations that reported low levels of disruption incurred average data breach costs of USD 4.63 million. For organizations that reported very significant disruptions, average costs were 7.9% higher, at USD 5.01 million. See Figure 22.

![Figure 22. Cost of a data breach based on the level of business disruption, measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_22)

## Recovery time

Even after a breach is contained, the work of recovery goes on. In this study, recovery means:

- Business operations are back to normal in areas affected by the breach.
- Organizations have met compliance obligations, such as paying fines.
- Customer confidence and employee trust have been restored.
- Organizations have put controls, technologies and expertise in place to avoid future data breaches.

Much of this work, such as re-establishing customer confidence, involves factors beyond technology. For most organizations, the hard work of recovery can be months away.

### Breach recovery rates were low

Only 12% of organizations queried during this year’s report said they had fully recovered from their data breaches. Most organizations said they were still working on them. See Figure 23.

![Figure 23. Has your organization recovered from the data breach? Share of all breached organizations](placeholder_for_figure_23)

### Full recovery took longer than 100 days

Among the share of organizations that had fully recovered, more than three-quarters said they took longer than 100 days. Recovery is a protracted process. Roughly one-third of organizations that had fully recovered said they required more than 150 days to do so. A small share, 3%, of fully recovered organizations were able to do so in less than 50 days. See Figure 24.

![Figure 24. Average time to recover from a data breach. From the organizations that reported they had recovered fully from the incident, measured in days (reference chart 23)](placeholder_for_figure_24)

## Factors that increase or decrease breach costs

When analyzing costs, it’s helpful to know which technologies or events tend to lower or raise them. One constant we found: AI and automation lowers costs, while a high level of cyber skills shortage raises them. In this analysis, we looked at 28 contributing factors. We examined the impact of each in isolation against the global average. We then looked at the top 3 factors found to amplify or mitigate the average data breach cost.

### Key factors that reduced costs

Employee training and the use of AI and machine learning insights were the top factors mitigating average data breach costs in this analysis. Employee training continues to be an essential element in cyberdefense strategies, specifically for detecting and stopping phishing attacks. AI and machine learning insights closely followed in second place. See Figure 25.

![Figure 25. Factors that decreased the average breach cost. Cost difference from USD 4.88M breach average; measured in USD](placeholder_for_figure_25)

### Key factors that increased costs

The top 3 factors that amplified breach costs in this analysis were security system complexity, security skills shortage and third-party breaches, which can include supply chain breaches. See Figure 26.

![Figure 26. Factors that increased the average breach cost. Cost difference from USD 4.88M breach average; measured in USD](placeholder_for_figure_26)

### High versus low levels of key cost amplifying factors

When organizations suffered from a high-level shortage of security skills, average breach costs were USD 5.74 million, compared to organizations with a low-level skills shortage, with USD 3.98 million. Similar disparities were seen across 2 other key cost factor areas. See Figure 27.

![Figure 27. Cost of a data breach for organizations with a high level versus low level of 3 cost amplifying factors. Measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_27)

### High versus low levels of key cost mitigating factors

When organizations suffered from low levels of employee training, average breach costs were USD 5.10 million, compared to organizations with high levels of employee training, with USD 4.15 million. Similar disparities were seen across 2 other key cost factor areas. See Figure 28.

![Figure 28. Cost of a data breach for organizations with a high level versus low level of 3 cost mitigating factors. Measured in USD millions](placeholder_for_figure_28)

### Security skills shortage

The number of organizations facing a critical lack of skilled security workers rose dramatically, to 53% in 2024 compared to 42% last year. This year’s research found a strong link between the worsening skills shortage and higher data breach costs.

#### Skills shortage equated to higher breach costs

In 2024, the average cost of breaches associated with a high-level skills shortage jumped to USD 5.74 million from USD 5.36 million last year, a 7.1% rise. This increase was USD 860,000 higher than the global average breach cost. See Figure 29.

## The cost of extortion attacks

The amount an organization spends on extortion attacks can vary based on type—ransomware, data exfiltration and destructive—as well as the way the organization responds. This factor is particularly true if law enforcement is called in, as this year’s study shows, where costs dropped dramatically when law enforcement investigators were involved. All 3 types of attacks were examined, including ransomware, where data is encrypted and a ransom demanded; data exfiltration, where data is stolen and the organization sometimes extorted; and destructive, where attackers delete data and destroy systems for their own objectives.

### Cost of destructive attacks outpaced other extortion

Destructive attacks, or those attacks that are intended to cause lasting and expensive damage, reached an average of USD 5.68 million, and proved more costly than either ransomware attacks or data exfiltration attacks. See Figure 30.

### Time to identify and contain 3 types of extortion attacks

All 3 types of attacks required between 284 and 294 days to identify and contain. See Figure 31.

### Paying the ransom

When organizations fell victim to ransomware, 52% called in law enforcement. The majority of those that did, 63%, ended up not paying the ransom. See Figure 32.

### Law enforcement involvement lowered breach costs

Average breach costs ranged from USD 4.38 million with law enforcement involved to USD 5.37 million without law enforcement, a cost difference of more than 20%, or nearly USD 1 million. Note: those cost figures didn’t include ransom payments. See Figure 33. Law enforcement involvement also sped up the time it took to identify and contain a breach. See figure 34.

## Reporting the breach and regulatory fines

This year’s report found most organizations reported their breaches to regulators or other government agencies. About a third also paid fines. As a result, reporting and paying fines have become common parts of post-breach responses. The study looked at the size of fines, as well as how long it took organizations to disclose the breach to regulators. Most organizations reported the breach within a few days.

### Average breach reporting times

Over half of organizations reported their data breach in under 72 hours, while 34% took more than 7
