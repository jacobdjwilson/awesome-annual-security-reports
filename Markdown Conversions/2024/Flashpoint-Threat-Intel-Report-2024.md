## Foreword:
On Resilience and Security in 2024

In the evolving landscape of global security, where cyber and physical threats increasingly converge, the Flashpoint
2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report offers a critical examination of the current threat environment. This year’s
analysis goes beyond traditional threat intelligence, incorporating Flashpoint’s unparalleled data and insights to shed light
on cyber threats, geopolitical turmoil, and escalating physical conflicts around the world. The goal: help your organization
to strengthen its defenses, ensure operational resilience, and proactively confront multifaceted threats—thereby
safeguarding critical assets, preventing financial losses, and protecting lives.

Cyber threats remain at the forefront of global security challenges, as opportunistic and resilient adversaries exploit
vulnerabilities through sophisticated tactics. Our annual report details the continuing surge of ransomware attacks, data
breach trends, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities, underscoring the evolving nature of cyber risks. Sectors rich in
sensitive and confidential data continue to be prime targets, emphasizing the critical need for robust cybersecurity
measures and actionable intelligence to counter threats and protect assets.

Looking ahead through 2024, we see the ongoing convergence of cyber and physical threats exacerbated by
escalating geopolitical unrest. These include crucial elections, the continuous conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the
Israel-Hamas War, and strategic tensions in the Taiwan Strait, each adding layers of complexity to the global threat
landscape.

A notable highlight of our annual report is its focus on the central role of open-source intelligence (OSINT) in addressing
not only cyber threats but also physical security challenges. In these pages, Flashpoint Executive Director of Global
Security, Andrew Borene, provides his perspective on the next evolution of OSINT. The importance of OSINT is further
detailed through a case study about its role in an investigation of fentanyl precursor sales. This investigation reveals the
complex networks behind illicit activities, showcasing the effectiveness of integrated intelligence in dismantling such
operations to enhance public safety and national security.

I invite you to explore the insights provided in the report and to utilize it as a
cornerstone for constructing a more resilient and secure future. As we navigate this
complex landscape, reinforcing our defenses against threats that seek to compromise
our collective security, the Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report
illuminates the path forward, offering a beacon of clarity in a sea of uncertainty.

## Executive Overview:
Cyber Threats at a Glance

6,077
Data Breaches

Data Breaches Rose 34.5% in 2023.

Flashpoint recorded 6,077 data breach incidents in 2023. More than 70% of these stolen
records—which include everything from financial data to personal health records—stemmed
from direct compromise or via an affected third-party.

17Bn Records Stolen in 2023.

From January 1 to February 29, 2024, the number of stolen or leaked personal data spiked
more than 4X compared to the same period last year. Unauthorized access and ransomware
remain the primary culprits behind data breaches, accounting for over half of the incidents
impacting major industries.

Prioritization continues to be challenging as the number of new technologies is introduced
into the market, with 2023 marking a significant peak of 33,137 issues. Of those issues, 35%
had known public exploits. Moving into 2024, Flashpoint continues to observe similar trends
in vulnerability totals, disclosure rates, and exploitability.

Ransomware Attacks Rose by 84% in 2023.

After leveraging both zero-day and disclosed vulnerabilities to gain illegal access,
financially motivated threat actors take additional actions on objectives, like installing
ransomware. Flashpoint identified a significant increase in ransomware attacks across
all sectors in 2023, resulting in an increase of 84% YoY. In the first two months of 2024
alone, the number of public ransomware attacks has grown nearly 23% compared to the
same period in 2023.

## Key Threat Landscapes: Data and Insights

### Data Breaches

Flashpoint breach data and intelligence, as detailed in this section, comprises the Deep and Dark Web and
open sources, including public attorney general reports, ransomware blogs, and Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) requests. Data is current to the date of publishing.

#### Data Breaches 2023-24

![Graph showing the number of known data breaches by month for 2023 and 2024.](placeholder_image_1)

Flashpoint observed a significant uptick in
data breach activity in 2023, with our analysts
recording 6,077 publicly reported data
breaches—a 34.5% increase compared to
2022. Data breaches are responsible for
leaking over 17 billion personal records that
included sensitive information such as names,
social security numbers, and financial data.
Over 70% of these incidents were the result
of unauthorized access that stemmed from
outside the affected organization.

Unauthorized access, continues to be the number
one cause of publicly disclosed data breaches.

However, of all incidents recorded last year, one cyberattack
in particular had a profound impact on the data breach
landscape—Cl0p’s exploitation of a vulnerability within
the MOVEit file transfer application. By leveraging a
vulnerability within the MOVEit Transfer file application
(VulnDB ID: 322555, CVE 2023-34362), the ransomware
group had compromised numerous organizations by the end
of 2023, either directly or through third-party compromise.
Looking specifically at public breach disclosures, Flashpoint
analysts determined that the MOVEit attack was responsible
for 19.3% of all reported 2023 data breaches. This figure
includes affected third-parties, organizations who were not
directly compromised by Cl0p, but had sensitive data stolen
from vendors within their supply chain.

### The Effect of Ransomware and
Unauthorized Access on Key Industries

To gain context into potential risks, organizations need to be aware of how the data breach landscape specifically affects
their industry. How are threat actors gaining access into systems? Understanding the answer to this question is critical to
forming safeguards and response plans.

#### Ransomware and Unauthorized Access Are
the Top Two Causes of Data Breaches in 2023.

Together, they are responsible for more than half of all incidents experienced by major sectors. However, for the
manufacturing and technology industries, ransomware and unauthorized access accounted for more than 85% of all
publicly disclosed breach incidents. This data further illustrates the need for robust threat intelligence and vulnerability
management programs that can help reduce risk, prevent losses, and maintain day-to-day operations.

### Vulnerabilities

The data in this section comprises Flashpoint’s vulnerability intelligence, covering all attack surfaces—including
vendors, endpoints, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), operational technology, open source software (OSS), and third-party
libraries and dependencies. Flashpoint’s vulnerability enrichment provides full context into metadata such as EPSS,
exploit intelligence, social risk, and ransomware likelihood. Data is current to the date of publishing.

From a threat actor’s perspective, unpatched vulnerabilities are opportunities to gain access into an organization. By
exploiting them, vulnerabilities allow malicious actors to spread through compromised networks—allowing them to
perform a wide variety of actions that may ultimately result in data loss or exposure. However, due to the increasing
disclosure of vulnerabilities from an expanded digital ecosystem, organizations may be unaware of vulnerabilities within
their networks. One major blind spot occurs when enterprises strictly rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure
(CVE) database, which is missing over 100,000 vulnerabilities—nearly a third of known vulnerability risk.

Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that
disclosed vulnerabilities have displayed a
consistent upward trend, with 2023 marking a
significant peak at 33,137 disclosures. This
progressive increase underscores the
escalating challenge for cybersecurity defenses,
as it is unfeasible for any organization, regardless
of maturity, to triage and remediate all of these
issues in a timely manner.

#### Vulnerability Disclosures Reported by Year, 2014-23

![Graph showing the number of vulnerability disclosures and public exploits by year from 2014 to 2023.](placeholder_image_2)

#### Vulnerability Disclosures Reported by Month, 2023-24

![Graph showing the number of vulnerability disclosures and public exploits by month for 2023 and 2024.](placeholder_image_3)

The efficient identification, prioritization, and
remediation of vulnerabilities are crucial in
preventing or mitigating the impact of
breaches and cyber attacks. However, security
teams will continue to face challenges as the
total number of vulnerabilities increases and
new issues are disclosed at a consistent rate.
Throughout 2023, the distribution of
vulnerabilities per month has seen little
fluctuation, with the number of vulnerabilities
being disclosed ranging from 2,425 to 3,111.

Moving into 2024, Flashpoint is observing
similar disclosure totals.

Further examining the rate of vulnerability disclosures, looking at the top 10 days in 2023 with the most reported
vulnerabilities, there is a consistent trend: they all take place on the second Tuesday of each month. This is no
coincidence as Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday has always played a major role in every year’s rising totals. As more vendors
adopt Microsoft’s monthly disclosure schedule, organizations will need a timely and actionable source of vulnerability
intelligence to help reduce the need for lengthy manual research.

#### Severity’s effect on prioritization

Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that nearly 52% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 are scored high to
critical (7.0 to 10.0) in severity, according to CVSSv3. For most organizations, vulnerabilities scored between 7.0 to 10.0
are considered to be a major risk, but if more than half of the year’s total meet this criteria, which ones should be
prioritized? Remediation is a timely process, and if vulnerability management teams are expected to triage all of these
issues, it is highly possible that many of these issues will go unpatched.

#### Breakdown of Vulnerabilities Disclosed
in 2023, CVSSv2 vs CVSSv3

Organizations should also be aware that the National Vulner-
ability Database (NVD) no longer provides base scores for
CVSSv2, and has instead opted to score using CVSSv3. This is
significant for three reasons.

*   Many organizations still currently choose to rely on CVSSv2
    for prioritization.
*   Due to differences in scoring methodologies, a vulnerability
    scored in CVSSv2 can vary greatly from CVSSv3, which can
    have a major impact on prioritization.
*   CVSSv4 was released in November 2023.

![Bar chart showing the breakdown of vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 by severity for CVSSv2 and CVSSv3.](placeholder_image_4)

Flashpoint has found that categorizing high severity vulnerabilities based on the following criteria can have
massive benefits for vulnerability management teams:

*   Remotely exploitable
*   Known public exploit
*   Known solution details

#### Breakdown of Actionable, High Severity Vulnerabilities, by
Availability and Exploitation, Disclosed by 2023

![Bar chart showing the breakdown of actionable, high severity vulnerabilities by availability and exploitation in 2023.](placeholder_image_5)

Adopting this model can
allow vulnerability management teams to
cut their critical workloads by nearly 85%.

By shifting immediate attention to issues that are remotely exploitable that have public exploits, with known solution
information, organizations can maximize their resources. Once those issues are fully triaged and taken care of, they can
then focus on less severe issues.

### Beyond CVE: Uncovering the Hidden
Vulnerability Landscape

Organizations strictly relying on CVE are likely unaware of nearly a third of known vulnerability risk. Flashpoint has
documented over 100,000 vulnerabilities that CVE has failed to report, many of which affect major vendors such as
Google and Microsoft. Flashpoint’s non-CVE coverage has also identified a significant number of issues affecting
numerous third-party libraries—in addition to zero-day and in-the-wild exploits that are being used by threat actors.

SAP AG
Google
Zoho Corp
Maria DB Foundation
FFmpeg Project
100,000

IBM Corporation
The Apache
Software Foundation
Microsoft Coporation
Oracle Corporation
Libav.org

As of February 2024, Flashpoint analysts have cataloged 330 vulnerabilities that were discovered being
exploited in the wild, that still do not have a CVE ID. These include vulnerabilities in:

*   Adobe Reader
*   Apple iOS
*   Apple macOS
*   Google Android
*   Microsoft SQL Server
*   Siemens SIMATIC
*   Solarwinds Orion Platform

As of February 2024, the following have been exploited in some form of malware, yet do not have a CVE ID:

*   Apache Hadoop
*   PHP
*   Google Authenticator for Android

Any vulnerability management team that feels underserved by their current coverage needs visibility into non-CVE
issues—especially if they are leveraging legacy or end-of-life software. Having immediate access to actionable data
empowers security teams to address issues, sometimes as fast as two weeks compared to CVE.

### Ransomware

The data in this section comprises victimized organizations that have been announced on ransomware blogs
and leak sites. Data is current to the date of publishing.

Ransomware plays a massive role within the threat intelligence landscape. Flashpoint identified a significant
escalation in ransomware attacks across all sectors in 2023, with the total rising to 5,028 attacks—an 84%
YoY increase (2,720).

LockBit was the most prolific ransomware group of
the year, claiming 1,049 victims—over one fifth of all
known ransomware attacks in 2023. The group has
gained notoriety for its sophisticated and ruthless
strain of ransomware. Recent analysis of a possible
LockBit 4.0 variant noted functionality that includes
randomizing the victims’ file naming to complicate
restoration efforts, a self-delete mechanism that
overwrites LockBit’s own file contents with null bytes,
and the ability to delete victims’ shadow copies and
backups to inhibit recovery. Coupled with their harsh
negotiation practices, including the use of a triple
extortion method, victims of LockBit are often left to
grapple with difficult decisions.

On February 20, 2024, US authorities, in collaboration with the UK’s National Crime Agency and additional
international allies, announced the disruption of the LockBit ransomware group as part of a concerted initiative known
as “Operation Cronos.”

Despite the success of Operation Cronos, the LockBit ransomware collective has persisted. They quickly established
a new Dark Web blog, alleging that law enforcement only managed to seize control of a segment of their operations.
According to its new site, they have resumed their ransomware operations, though these assertions have not been
confirmed as of this publishing. Even with LockBit’s continued activities post-disruption, indications are suggesting that
Operation Cronos has had a more significant impact on their operations than they are willing to admit.

Nevertheless, as of this publishing, LockBit remains the most prolific ransomware group in 2024,
documenting 154 public victim announcements on their leak site within the first two months alone—almost
triple the number of the second most active groups (8Base, BlackCat). There’s a possibility that the group
could recover. However, even if they don’t, numerous other cybercriminal factions are poised to take their
place, indicating that the fight against cybercrime is expected to persist indefinitely.

So far in 2024, the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks on organizations have increased, with 637
public ransomware attacks in the first two months, up from 518 in the same period of 2023. To mitigate this
rising threat, it’s crucial for organizations to develop and implement robust prevention and response
strategies proactively. Delaying these discussions until after an attack occurs significantly hampers the
ability to reduce its impact.

The construction and engineering sector
emerged as the most targeted industry by
ransomware in 2023, with 416 public
incidents. The professional services, internet
software and services, and healthcare sectors
were also heavily targeted in 2023,
highlighting the cross-industry impact of
ransomware and the critical need for
sector-specific defense strategies. In the first
two months of 2024, the construction and
engineering sector remained the most
targeted with 57 public attacks so far. The
manufacturing and healthcare sectors follow
behind, each with 49 public attacks in the first
two months of 2024. These critical
infrastructure sectors share several
commonalities that make them lucrative for
ransomware groups:

#### Top Ten Industries Targeted by Ransomware in 2023

Food Products
5.43%

Specialized Consumer
Services
6.17%

Automotive
6.62%

Industrial Conglomerates
9.05%

Real Estate
5.18%

Construction & Engineering
18.72%

Professional Services
incl. FinServ and Law Firms
13.77%

Education Services
9.54%

Internet Software & Services
13.23%

Healthcare Providers
& Services
12.29%

1.  They each contain rich amounts of sensitive and confidential data that threat actors can hold ransom or
    exploit for financial gain.
2.  Because of both the sensitivity of the data they possess (for sectors like healthcare), and the high costs
    of operation that make it expensive to halt during ransom negotiations (for sectors like manufacturing
    and construction and engineering), organizations in these sectors may have a higher willingness to pay
    the ransom.
3.  These organizations often generate higher amounts of revenue, which means ransomers can yield a
    higher profit per victim compared to other industries.
4.  They rely on operational technology that could contain vulnerabilities, providing a window for threat
    actors to gain access to victims’ systems.

Geographically, the United States bore the brunt of
ransomware attacks, with 2,386 incidents, reflecting
its status as a major target due to its economic
significance and digital infrastructure.

#### Emerging Extortion Tactics...

As ransomware groups become more sophisticated, threat actors are becoming increasingly hostile and
brazen as well. They are adopting new tactics to add external pressures. This includes doxxing executives,
threatening to release embarrassing or sensitive information, or notifying the victim’s stakeholders that
the company has been breached and is not willing to pay to protect compromised data—all to increase the
likelihood of payment. The “extortion economy” represents a growing risk to organizations that parallels
many ransomware threats.

To add further complexity, the lines between overt malicious actors and self-proclaimed ethical hackers
are increasingly blurred. Consequently, organizations must actively engage in these environments to
preemptively counter threats and adapt strategies from ransomware response playbooks to address these
lesser-known extortion techniques.

1.  Data Encryption: The most well-known tactic of using malware to lock or encode a victim’s data,
    demanding payment for its decryption and release.
2.  Data Extortion: Threats have evolved from just ransom demands to broader threats of public
    data exposure.
3.  Unethical Vulnerability Disclosures: While many ethical hackers aim to responsibly disclose
    vulnerabilities, some blur the lines by tying their discoveries to monetary demands.
4.  Underground Economies’ Influence: Beyond merely trading stolen data, Dark Web marketplaces
    increase the value of this data, treating it as a secondary market commodity to gain access to
    victims’ systems.
5.  Access Brokers: The sale of unauthorized system access is on the rise, often serving as the precursor
    to multifaceted cyber attacks.
6.  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks: Attackers overwhelm a target’s online services, causing
    them to be unavailable. They then demand a ransom to stop the attack.
7.  Physical Threats Related to Cyber Activities: Extortionists sometimes combine cyber threats with
    physical threats, suggesting harm might come to a victim or their loved ones unless demands related to
    cyber activities are met.

### ...And How to Fight Back

1.  Implement Robust Encryption and Backup Procedures: To counter data encryption tactics,
    organizations should ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted and regularly backed up to secure,
    off-site locations. This minimizes the impact of ransomware attacks by allowing organizations to restore
    encrypted data without paying a ransom.
2.  Advanced Threat Detection and Response: Employ advanced threat detection systems that utilize
    machine learning and AI to identify unusual data access or transfer patterns, indicative of data extortion
    attempts. Establish a swift incident response plan to contain and mitigate threats before they escalate.
3.  Vulnerability Management Program: Develop a comprehensive vulnerability management program
    that includes regular security assessments, penetration testing, and the prompt patching of software
    vulnerabilities. This reduces the risk of unethical vulnerability disclosures and ensures that potential
    security gaps are addressed before they can be exploited.
4.  Monitor and Analyze Dark Web Activities: Engage in continuous monitoring of Dark Web forums
    and marketplaces to understand the latest trends in underground economies. Utilize this intelligence
    to strengthen your security posture against emerging threats and to be aware of any mention of your
    organization’s data on these platforms.
5.  Zero Trust Architecture: Adopt a zero-trust security model that verifies every user and device trying
    to access your network, regardless of their location. This approach minimizes the risk posed by access
    brokers by ensuring that access is strictly controlled and monitored.
6.  Protect Against DDoS Attacks. Implement DDoS protection solutions that can detect and mitigate
    large-scale DDoS attacks. These services can help maintain the availability of online services during an
    attack, reducing the attackers’ leverage for ransom demands.
7.  Employee Education and Physical Security Measures: Educate employees about the risks of cyber
    threats and the importance of physical security. This includes training on recognizing phishing attempts,
    securing personal and company devices, and reporting any suspicious activities. Enhance physical
    security measures to protect against threats that merge cyber and physical elements.

## Commentary

By Andrew Borene
Executive Director of Global Security

### Beyond Bytes and Bullets:
Shaping the Future of Allied Threat Intelligence

Strategies for integrating OSINT capabilities with cyber, physical, and geopolitical
intelligence to proactively fight global security threats.

The need for a holistic, integrated approach to intelligence and security has never been more acute. The
challenges ahead are not only defending against attacks and increasing resilience; they lie in understanding
and shaping the future of intelligence in a world where the digital and physical realms are inexorably linked.

The importance of high-fidelity, high-reliability data in this context cannot be overstated, as it forms the very
backbone of an intelligence enterprise that enables various decision makers to distill actionable insights from
vast streams of information. Governments must make informed decisions to safeguard national interests and
those of their allies. Private enterprises and corporate boards need insights to protect themselves from a
growing field of e-crime actors and state-backed threats. Universities and research institutions must protect
intellectual property. Global media entities need means to help validate trusted information and to debunk
false narratives that may be amplified with deepfakes and generative AI.

Navigating this new era demands not just vigilance but innovation, as we chart a course through the
intertwined fog of digital and physical conflicts to safeguard our collective future.

#### Converging Threats Across Conflicts
and Competitive Domains

Ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas War in
Gaza, expanding proxy violence in the Middle East, rising tensions in
the Taiwan Strait, and new forms of large scale data theft and
extortion all underscore a near-term future fraught with increasingly
complex geopolitical and cyber challenges. This emerging landscape
demands a profound reevaluation of how nations, non-state actors,
and intelligence communities navigate the intelligence needed
for warfare, peacekeeping, and protecting prosperity in our
interconnected world.

Through lenses of what is generally termed Great Power Competition
by allies, and Hybrid Warfare or Unrestricted Warfare by adversaries, our understanding of global security is
in a pivotal phase of transformation. This digital transformation and the entanglement of commercial,
government, and nonstate actors across an observed fragmentation of the cyber domain calls security
professionals toward a unified intelligence framework to seamlessly integrate cyber and physical threat
intelligence in real time and at scale.

### Developing Professionally-Sourced Intelligence
(Pro-SINT) within OSINT

As we confront these multifaceted threats, we may need to embrace a subtle distinction between
Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and a subset that I call Professionally-Sourced Intelligence (Pro-SINT).
What I unofficially refer to as “Pro-SINT” is distinct from a growing set of crowdsourced, hobbyist, and other
unfiltered OSINT efforts using publicly-available information. Pro-SINT leverages more proprietary and
commercially-available information and is marked by professional standards, oversight, privacy compliance,
ability to collaborate with law enforcement entities, and most importantly a deep commitment to a set of
international ethics that aligns with those of allied governments, regulated industries, and a scientific
standard for verification and auditability.

The type of Professional OSINTer I’ve described, may reside in a government, a company, an NGO, or a
university, but they all share a focus on deep-web data, Dark Web exploration, cyber-physical convergence,
and sophisticated analysis, enriching traditional human observational intelligence methods and analytical
judgment with the technologies required to provide nuanced insights at scale among the complex interplay
of cyber and physical threats in real time.

Professional OSINT is not only about enhancing defensive measures or reducing mean times to resolution of
vulnerabilities, but about preemptively understanding and countering the strategic moves of adversaries,
frequently seen in the chatter of encrypted communications preceding abrupt attacks or indicating
persistent intrusion. Moreover, the integration of well-trained and auditable artificial intelligence and
machine learning technologies into intelligence operations for commercially-available information offers
unprecedented capabilities in detecting deepfakes and other sophisticated cyber threats, further enhancing
our ability to anticipate and mitigate potential escalations in both cyber and kinetic domains
