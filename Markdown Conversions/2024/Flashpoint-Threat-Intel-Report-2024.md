Foreword: 
On Resilience and Security in 2024In the evolving landscape of global security, where cyber and physical threats increasingly converge, the Flashpoint
2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report offers a critical examination of the current threat environment. This years
analysis goes beyond traditional threat intelligence, incorporating Flashpoints unparalleled data and insights to shed light 
on cyber threats, geopolitical turmoil, and escalating physical conflicts around the world. The goal: help your organization 
to strengthen its defenses, ensure operational resilience, and proactively confront multifaceted threatsthereby
safeguarding critical assets, preventing financial losses, and protecting lives.
Cyber threats remain at the forefront of global security challenges, as opportunistic and resilient adversaries exploit 
vulnerabilities through sophisticated tactics. Our annual report details the continuing surge of ransomware attacks, data 
breach trends, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities, underscoring the evolving nature of cyber risks. Sectors rich in
sensitive and confidential data continue to be prime targets, emphasizing the critical need for robust cybersecurity
measures and actionable intelligence to counter threats and protect assets. 
Looking ahead through 2024, we see the ongoing convergence of cyber and physical threats exacerbated by
escalating geopolitical unrest. These include crucial elections, the continuous conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the 
Israel\-Hamas War, and strategic tensions in the Taiwan Strait, each adding layers of complexity to the global threat
landscape.
A notable highlight of our annual report is its focus on the central role of open\-source intelligence (OSINT) in addressing 
not only cyber threats but also physical security challenges. In these pages, Flashpoint Executive Director of Global
Security, Andrew Borene, provides his perspective on the next evolution of OSINT. The importance of OSINT is further 
detailed through a case study about its role in an investigation of fentanyl precursor sales. This investigation reveals the 
complex networks behind illicit activities, showcasing the effectiveness of integrated intelligence in dismantling such 
operations to enhance public safety and national security. 
I invite you to explore the insights provided in the report and to utilize it as a
cornerstone for constructing a more resilient and secure future. As we navigate this
complex landscape, reinforcing our defenses against threats that seek to compromise 
our collective security, the Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report
illuminates the path forward, offering a beacon of clarity in a sea of uncertainty.

Executive Overview:
Cyber Threats at a Glance 
Data Breaches Rose 34\.5% in 2023\.Flashpoint recorded 6,077 data breach incidents in 2023\. More than 70% of these stolen 
recordswhich include everything from financial data to personal health recordsstemmed 
from direct compromise or via an affected third\-party. 
17Bn Records Stolen in 2023\.From January 1 to February 29, 2024, the number of stolen or leaked personal data spiked 
more than 4X compared to the same period last year. Unauthorized access and ransomware 
remain the primary culprits behind data breaches, accounting for over half of the incidents 
impacting major industries. 
35% of Vulnerabilities in 2023 
Had Known Public Exploits.Prioritization continues to be challenging as the number of new technologies is introduced 
into the market, with 2023 marking a significant peak of 33,137 issues. Of those issues, 35% 
had known public exploits. Moving into 2024, Flashpoint continues to observe similar trends 
in vulnerability totals, disclosure rates, and exploitability. 
Ransomware Attacks Rose by 84% in 2023\.After leveraging both zero\-day and disclosed vulnerabilities to gain illegal access,
financially motivated threat actors take additional actions on objectives, like installing 
ransomware. Flashpoint identified a significant increase in ransomware attacks across 
all sectors in 2023, resulting in an increase of 84% YoY. In the first two months of 2024 
alone, the number of public ransomware attacks has grown nearly 23% compared to the 
same period in 2023\.6,077

Key Threat Landscapes: Data and Insights 
Data Breaches 
Flashpoint breach data and intelligence, as detailed in this section, comprises the Deep and Dark Web and
open sources, including public attorney general reports, ransomware blogs, and Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) requests. Data is current to the date of publishing.Flashpoint observed a significant uptick in 
data breach activity in 2023, with our analysts 
recording 6,077 publicly reported data
breachesa 34\.5% increase compared to 
1\. Data breaches are responsible for
leaking over 17 billion personal records that 
included sensitive information such as names, 
social security numbers, and financial data.
Over 70% of these incidents were the result 
of unauthorized access that stemmed from
outside the affected organization.The United States represented more than 60% of
the global data breach total, reporting 3,804 data
breachesa 19\.8% increase compared to 2022\. In the 
first two months of 2024 alone, data breaches have
increased by an additional 30% compared to the
previous year, within the same period.

However, of all incidents recorded last year, one cyberattack
in particular had a profound impact on the data breach
landscapeCl0ps exploitation of a vulnerability within
the MOVEit file transfer application. By leveraging a
vulnerability within the MOVEit Transfer file application
(VulnDB ID: 322555, CVE 2023\-34362\), the ransomware 
group had compromised numerous organizations by the end 
of 2023, either directly or through third\-party compromise. 
Looking specifically at public breach disclosures, Flashpoint 
analysts determined that the MOVEit attack was responsible 
for 19\.3% of all reported 2023 data breaches. This figure 
includes affected third\-parties, organizations who were not 
directly compromised by Cl0p, but had sensitive data stolen 
from vendors within their supply chain.
Unauthorized Access Is Up In 2024\.As we move forward into 2024, the data breach landscape is seeing a 
significant spike in stolen or leaked personal data. From January 1 \-
February 29, 2024, threat actors compromised 1\.897 billion personal 
records and credentialsa 429% increase compared to the same period 
last year. Five data breach incidents have had an outsized impact:

The Effect of Ransomware and
Unauthorized Access on Key IndustriesTo gain context into potential risks, organizations need to be aware of how the data breach landscape specifically affects 
their industry. How are threat actors gaining access into systems? Understanding the answer to this question is critical to 
forming safeguards and response plans.
Ransomware and Unauthorized Access Are
the Top Two Causes of Data Breaches in 2023\.Together, they are responsible for more than half of all incidents experienced by major sectors. However, for the
manufacturing and technology industries, ransomware and unauthorized access accounted for more than 85% of all
publicly disclosed breach incidents. This data further illustrates the need for robust threat intelligence and vulnerability
management programs that can help reduce risk, prevent losses, and maintain day\-to\-day operations.

Vulnerabilities
The data in this section comprises Flashpoints vulnerability intelligence, covering all attack surfacesincluding
vendors, endpoints, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), operational technology, open source software (OSS), and third\-party 
libraries and dependencies. Flashpoints vulnerability enrichment provides full context into metadata such as EPSS, 
exploit intelligence, social risk, and ransomware likelihood. Data is current to the date of publishing.
From a threat actors perspective, unpatched vulnerabilities are opportunities to gain access into an organization. By
exploiting them, vulnerabilities allow malicious actors to spread through compromised networksallowing them to
perform a wide variety of actions that may ultimately result in data loss or exposure. However, due to the increasing 
disclosure of vulnerabilities from an expanded digital ecosystem, organizations may be unaware of vulnerabilities within 
their networks. One major blind spot occurs when enterprises strictly rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure 
(CVE) database, which is missing over 100,000 vulnerabilitiesnearly a third of known vulnerability risk.Flashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that 
disclosed vulnerabilities have displayed a
consistent upward trend, with 2023 marking a 
significant peak at 33,137 disclosures. This
progressive increase underscores the
escalating challenge for cybersecurity defenses, 
as it is unfeasible for any organization, regardless 
of maturity, to triage and remediate all of these 
issues in a timely manner.The efficient identification, prioritization, and 
remediation of vulnerabilities are crucial inpreventing or mitigating the impact of 
breaches and cyber attacks. However, security 
teams will continue to face challenges as the 
total number of vulnerabilities increases and 
new issues are disclosed at a consistent rate. 
Throughout 2023, the distribution of
vulnerabilities per month has seen little
fluctuation, with the number of vulnerabilities 
being disclosed ranging from 2,425 to 3,111\. 
Moving into 2024, Flashpoint is observing 
similar disclosure totals.

8Further examining the rate of vulnerability disclosures, looking at the top 10 days in 2023 with the most reported
vulnerabilities, there is a consistent trend: they all take place on the second Tuesday of each month. This is no
coincidence as Microsofts Patch Tuesday has always played a major role in every years rising totals. As more vendors 
adopt Microsofts monthly disclosure schedule, organizations will need a timely and actionable source of vulnerability 
intelligence to help reduce the need for lengthy manual research.Severitys effect on prioritizationFlashpoint vulnerability intelligence shows that nearly 52% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 are scored high to
critical (7\.0 to 10\.0\) in severity, according to CVSSv3\. For most organizations, vulnerabilities scored between 7\.0 to 10\.0 
are considered to be a major risk, but if more than half of the years total meet this criteria, which ones should be
prioritized? Remediation is a timely process, and if vulnerability management teams are expected to triage all of these 
issues, it is highly possible that many of these issues will go unpatched. 
Organizations should also be aware that the National Vulner\-
ability Database (NVD) no longer provides base scores for 
CVSSv2, and has instead opted to score using CVSSv3\. This is 
significant for three reasons. 
Many organizations still currently choose to rely on CVSSv2 
for prioritization.
Due to differences in scoring methodologies, a vulnerability 
scored in CVSSv2 can vary greatly from CVSSv3, which can 
have a major impact on prioritization.
CVSSv4 was released in November 2023\.Breakdown of Vulnerabilities Disclosed

Flashpoint has found that categorizing high severity vulnerabilities based on the following criteria can have 
 massive benefits for vulnerability management teams:
Remotely exploitable
Known public exploit
Known solution detailsAdopting this model can
allow vulnerability management teams to 
cut their critical workloads by nearly 85%.By shifting immediate attention to issues that are remotely exploitable that have public exploits, with known solution 
information, organizations can maximize their resources. Once those issues are fully triaged and taken care of, they can 
then focus on less severe issues.

Beyond CVE: Uncovering the Hidden
Vulnerability LandscapeOrganizations strictly relying on CVE are likely unaware of nearly a third of known vulnerability risk. Flashpoint has
documented over 100,000 vulnerabilities that CVE has failed to report, many of which affect major vendors such as
Google and Microsoft. Flashpoints non\-CVE coverage has also identified a significant number of issues affecting
numerous third\-party librariesin addition to zero\-day and in\-the\-wild exploits that are being used by threat actors.As of February 2024, Flashpoint analysts have cataloged 330 vulnerabilities that were discovered being
exploited in the wild, that still do not have a CVE ID. These include vulnerabilities in:
Adobe Reader
Apple iOS
Apple macOS
Google Android
Microsoft SQL Server
Siemens SIMATIC
Solarwinds Orion Platform
As of February 2024, the following have been exploited in some form of malware, yet do not have a CVE ID:
Apache Hadoop
Google Authenticator for Android
PHP
Any vulnerability management team that feels underserved by their current coverage needs visibility into non\-CVE
issuesespecially if they are leveraging legacy or end\-of\-life software. Having immediate access to actionable data
empowers security teams to address issues, sometimes as fast as two weeks compared to CVE.

Ransomware
The data in this section comprises victimized organizations that have been announced on ransomware blogs
and leak sites. Data is current to the date of publishing.Ransomware plays a massive role within the threat intelligence landscape. Flashpoint identified a significant
escalation in ransomware attacks across all sectors in 2023, with the total rising to 5,028 attacksan 84%
YoY increase (2,720\).
LockBit was the most prolific ransomware group of 
the year, claiming 1,049 victimsover one fifth of all 
known ransomware attacks in 2023\. The group has 
gained notoriety for its sophisticated and ruthless 
strain of ransomware. Recent analysis of a possible 
LockBit 4\.0 variant noted functionality that includes
randomizing the victims file naming to complicate 
restoration efforts, a self\-delete mechanism that 
overwrites LockBits own file contents with null bytes, 
and the ability to delete victims shadow copies and 
backups to inhibit recovery. Coupled with their harsh 
negotiation practices, including the use of a triple 
extortion method, victims of LockBit are often left to 
grapple with difficult decisions.

On February 20, 2024, US authorities, in collaboration with the UKs National Crime Agency and additional 
international allies, announced the disruption of the LockBit ransomware group as part of a concerted initiative known
as Operation Cronos.
Despite the success of Operation Cronos, the LockBit ransomware collective has persisted. They quickly established 
a new Dark Web blog, alleging that law enforcement only managed to seize control of a segment of their operations. 
According to its new site, they have resumed their ransomware operations, though these assertions have not been 
confirmed as of this publishing. Even with LockBits continued activities post\-disruption, indications are suggesting that 
Operation Cronos has had a more significant impact on their operations than they are willing to admit.Seven Stages of a Ransomware Attack

Nevertheless, as of this publishing, LockBit remains the most prolific ransomware group in 2024,
documenting 154 public victim announcements on their leak site within the first two months alonealmost 
triple the number of the second most active groups (8Base, BlackCat). Theres a possibility that the group 
could recover. However, even if they dont, numerous other cybercriminal factions are poised to take their 
place, indicating that the fight against cybercrime is expected to persist indefinitely. 
So far in 2024, the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks on organizations have increased, with 637 
public ransomware attacks in the first two months, up from 518 in the same period of 2023\. To mitigate this 
rising threat, its crucial for organizations to develop and implement robust prevention and response
strategies proactively. Delaying these discussions until after an attack occurs significantly hampers the
ability to reduce its impact.
The construction and engineering sector 
emerged as the most targeted industry by 
ransomware in 2023, with 416 public
incidents. The professional services, internet 
software and services, and healthcare sectors 
were also heavily targeted in 2023,
highlighting the cross\-industry impact of
ransomware and the critical need for
sector\-specific defense strategies. In the first 
two months of 2024, the construction and
engineering sector remained the most
targeted with 57 public attacks so far. The 
manufacturing and healthcare sectors follow 
behind, each with 49 public attacks in the first 
two months of 2024\. These critical
infrastructure sectors share several
commonalities that make them lucrative for 
ransomware groups:
1\. They each contain rich amounts of senstive and confidential data that threat actors can hold ransom or 
exploit for financial gain.
1\. Because of both the sensitivity of the data they possess (for sectors like healthcare), and the high costs
of operation that make it expensive to halt during ransom negotiations (for sectors like manufacturing
and construction and engineering), organizations in these sectors may have a higher willingness to pay
the ransom.
1\. These organizations often generate higher amounts of revenue, which means ransomers can yield a
higher profit per victim compared to other industries.
1\. They rely on operational technology that could contain vulnerabilities, providing a window for threat
actors to gain access to victims systems.

14Emerging Extortion Tactics
As ransomware groups become more sophisticated, threat actors are becoming increasingly hostile and 
brazen as well. They are adopting new tactics to add external pressures. This includes doxxing executives, 
threatening to release embarrassing or sensitive information, or notifying the victims stakeholders that
the company has been breached and is not willing to pay to protect compromised dataall to increase the
likelihood of payment. The extortion economy represents a growing risk to organizations that parallels 
many ransomware threats.
To add further complexity, the lines between overt malicious actors and self\-proclaimed ethical hackers
are increasingly blurred. Consequently, organizations must actively engage in these environments to
preemptively counter threats and adapt strategies from ransomware response playbooks to address these 
lesser\-known extortion techniques.
Data Encryption: The most well\-known tactic of using malware to lock or encode a victims data,
demanding payment for its decryption and release.
Data Extortion: Threats have evolved from just ransom demands to broader threats of public
data exposure.
Unethical Vulnerability Disclosures: While many ethical hackers aim to responsibly disclose
vulnerabilities, some blur the lines by tying their discoveries to monetary demands.
Underground Economies Influence: Beyond merely trading stolen data, Dark Web marketplaces
increase the value of this data, treating it as a secondary market commodity to gain access to
victims systems.
Access Brokers: The sale of unauthorized system access is on the rise, often serving as the precursor 
to multifaceted cyber attacks. 
Distributed Denial\-of\-Service (DDoS) Attacks: Attackers overwhelm a targets online services, causing 
them to be unavailable. They then demand a ransom to stop the attack.
Physical Threats Related to Cyber Activities: Extortionists sometimes combine cyber threats with
physical threats, suggesting harm might come to a victim or their loved ones unless demands related to 
cyber activities are met.
Geographically, theUnited Statesbore the brunt of
ransomware attacks, with2,386 incidents , reflecting
its status as a major target due to its economic
significance and digital infrastructure.

And How to Fight Back 
Implement Robust Encryption and Backup Procedures: To counter data encryption tactics,
organizations should ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted and regularly backed up to secure,
off\-site locations. This minimizes the impact of ransomware attacks by allowing organizations to restore 
encrypted data without paying a ransom.
Advanced Threat Detection and Response: Employ advanced threat detection systems that utilize 
machine learning and AI to identify unusual data access or transfer patterns, indicative of data extortion 
attempts. Establish a swift incident response plan to contain and mitigate threats before they escalate.
Vulnerability Management Program: Develop a comprehensive vulnerability management program 
that includes regular security assessments, penetration testing, and the prompt patching of software 
vulnerabilities. This reduces the risk of unethical vulnerability disclosures and ensures that potential 
security gaps are addressed before they can be exploited.
Monitor and Analyze Dark Web Activities: Engage in continuous monitoring of Dark Web forums 
and marketplaces to understand the latest trends in underground economies. Utilize this intelligence 
to strengthen your security posture against emerging threats and to be aware of any mention of your 
organizations data on these platforms.
Zero Trust Architecture: Adopt a zero\-trust security model that verifies every user and device trying 
to access your network, regardless of their location. This approach minimizes the risk posed by access 
brokers by ensuring that access is strictly controlled and monitored.
Protect Against DDoS Attacks. Implement DDoS protection solutions that can detect and mitigate 
large\-scale DDoS attacks. These services can help maintain the availability of online services during an 
attack, reducing the attackers leverage for ransom demands.
Employee Education and Physical Security Measures: Educate employees about the risks of cyber 
threats and the importance of physical security. This includes training on recognizing phishing attempts, 
securing personal and company devices, and reporting any suspicious activities. Enhance physical
security measures to protect against threats that merge cyber and physical elements.

Commentary 
Beyond Bytes and Bullets:
Shaping the Future of Allied Threat Intelligence
Strategies for integrating OSINT capabilities with cyber, physical, and geopolitical
intelligence to proactively fight global security threats.The need for a holistic, integrated approach to intelligence and security has never been more acute. The
challenges ahead are not only defending against attacks and increasing resilience; they lie in understanding 
and shaping the future of intelligence in a world where the digital and physical realms are inexorably linked.
The importance of high\-fidelity, high\-reliability data in this context cannot be overstated, as it forms the very 
backbone of an intelligence enterprise that enables various decision makers to distill actionable insights from 
vast streams of information. Governments must make informed decisions to safeguard national interests and 
those of their allies. Private enterprises and corporate boards need insights to protect themselves from a 
growing field of e\-crime actors and state\-backed threats. Universities and research institutions must protect 
intellectual property. Global media entities need means to help validate trusted information and to debunk 
false narratives that may be amplified with deepakes and generative AI.
Navigating this new era demands not just vigilance but innovation, as we chart a course through the
intertwined fog of digital and physical conflicts to safeguard our collective future.

Ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel\-Hamas War in 
Gaza, expanding proxy violence in the Middle East, rising tensions in 
the Taiwan Strait, and new forms of large scale data theft and
extortion all underscore a near\-term future fraught with increasingly 
complex geopolitical and cyber challenges. This emerging landscape 
demands a profound reevaluation of how nations, non\-state actors, 
and intelligence communities navigate the intelligence needed
for warfare, peacekeeping, and protecting prosperity in our
interconnected world.
Through lenses of what is generally termed Great Power Competition 
by allies, and Hybrid Warfare or Unrestricted Warfare by adversaries, our understanding of global security is 
in a pivotal phase of transformation. This digital transformation and the entanglement of commercial,
government, and nonstate actors across an observed fragmentation of the cyber domain calls security
professionals toward a unified intelligence framework to seamlessly integrate cyber and physical threat
intelligence in real time and at scale.

Developing Professionally\-Sourced Intelligence
(Pro\-SINT) within OSINTAs we confront these multifaceted threats, we may need to embrace a subtle distinction between
Open\-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and a subset that I call Professionally\-Sourced Intelligence (Pro\-SINT). 
What I unofficially refer to as Pro\-SINT is distinct from a growing set of crowdsourced, hobbyist, and other 
unfiltered OSINT efforts using publicly\-available information. Pro\-SINT leverages more proprietary and
commercially\-available information and is marked by professional standards, oversight, privacy compliance, 
ability to collaborate with law enforcement entities, and most importantly a deep commitment to a set of 
international ethics that aligns with those of allied governments, regulated industries, and a scientific
standard for verification and auditability.
The type of Professional OSINTer Ive described, may reside in a government, a company, an NGO, or a
university, but they all share a focus on deep\-web data, Dark Web exploration, cyber\-physical convergence, 
and sophisticated analysis, enriching traditional human observational intelligence methods and analytical 
judgment with the technologies required to provide nuanced insights at scale among the complex interplay 
of cyber and physical threats in real time. 
Professional OSINT is not only about enhancing defensive measures or reducing mean times to resolution of 
vulnerabilities, but about preemptively understanding and countering the strategic moves of adversaries,
frequently seen in the chatter of encrypted communications preceding abrupt attacks or indicating
persistent intrusion. Moreover, the integration of well\-trained and auditable artificial intelligence and
machine learning technologies into intelligence operations for commercially\-available information offers
unprecedented capabilities in detecting deepfakes and other sophisticated cyber threats, further enhancing 
our ability to anticipate and mitigate potential escalations in both cyber and kinetic domains, bolstering
security postures for individual organizations, governments, and alliances.
A professional ethos is also essential to navigate the complexities introduced by decentralized platforms and 
Dark Web tools, which, while enabling resilience against censorship and protection from hostile surveillance 
in many parts of the world, also can pose challenges in distinguishing credible intelligence from
misinformation in open societies.
Challenges in Decentralized Communications 
and the Dark Web
A unique aspect of a hybrid digital evolution has been the role of decentralized communication platforms 
and the expanding use of Dark Web communications by both threat actors and friendly users with legitimate 
needs for protection and undetected attribution. 
These platforms have transcended their initial purposes to become digital command centers and
sanctuaries for many unfiltered narratives. Their observed impact in facilitating real\-time, unedited 
 information flows during the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza has been profound, underscoring the blurring
lines between cyber, information, and kinetic warfare and highlighting the strategic significance of data in 
modern warfare.

Cross\-platform, encrypted messaging, and Dark Web service platforms have also proved useful sources for 
key insights into the strategic, operational, and tactical context of challenges including proxy violence in the
Middle East, tensions in the Taiwan Strait, hostile espionage activities against allies, in addition to the evolving 
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber
criminals for extortion or fraud.Strengthening collaboration among allies becomes crucial as we collectively counteract the threats posed by 
adversaries and protect shared economic interests and democratic values in cyberspace. However, achieving 
such unity in intelligence and security efforts presents its own set of challenges. Divergent political interests, 
varying levels of technological sophistication, and concerns over sovereignty and privacy can hinder the
formation of a cohesive global threat picture for allies across public sector and private sector pillars.
Recognizing these differences and ensuring an ability to appropriately tailor data collection and use for each 
individual client is paramount as we strive for a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to professional
security intelligence.

Toward a Unified Approach to Global Security Intelligence 
The interwoven nature of ongoing wars, global conflicts, and the critical role of digital platforms in these
dynamics underscore the imperative for comprehensive and forward\-looking intelligence collaboration
strategies. These strategies must not only address the immediate challenges posed by the current
geopolitical and cyber threats but also anticipate the evolving nature of warfare, espionage, and transnational 
criminal enterprise.The insights gained by professional OSINTers are indispensable in this endeavor, enabling responses that are 
as dynamic and multifaceted as the threats faced by our clients.In navigating this complex landscape, a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to security becomes
paramount. By fostering unity among commercial enterprises, governmental agencies, and international
partners, we can develop robust, adaptable security strategies that transcend traditional paradigms. This 
unified approach, leveraging the latest technological advancements and prioritizing ethical, legal, and political 
frameworks, is our best defense against the insidious threats that seek to undermine our institutions,
economies, and democracies.Embracing the interconnected world as it is, not as we wish it to be, is a key first step. It requires
understanding the criticality of machine speed and scale in the digital domain, while always remembering 
that humans are more important than hardware. Developing high\-fidelity data sourcing and high\-trust
professional networks will help us protect the foundations of our global society alongside our allies and in 
defense of our collective security. Our shared prosperity demands it.Security and intelligence professionals all face a new hybrid era. The global threat landscape is transforming 
and scalingfortunately, so are we.2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report

Case Study 
Leveraging Threat Intelligence in Public Safety Missions:
Investigating Sales of Fentanyl Precursors
In the complex global security challenge posed by the trafficking of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, the
importance of open\-source intelligence (OSINT) in public safety missions cannot be overstated. Flashpoint 
National Security Solutions (FNSS) stands at the forefront of addressing these challenges by providing
tailored intelligence that empowers government and public sector entities to conduct effective
investigations. 
This case study explores how Flashpoints advanced OSINT capabilities have empowered government and 
public sector agencies to unravel the sophisticated networks behind the sales of fentanyl precursors
(chemicals used to manufacture the synthetic opioid) on digital platforms. By dissecting the digital footprint 
of the fentanyl precursor trade, Flashpoint provides the critical tools and intelligence needed for public safety 
and national security teams to anticipate, mitigate, and disrupt these illicit activities effectively. 
The Challenge
The trafficking of synthetic opioids has reached alarming levels, with threat actors employing increasingly 
sophisticated methods to evade detection. In particular, the sale of fentanyl precursorsoften advertised 
openly yet obscured through scientific nomenclature and digital platformsposes significant hurdles for law 
enforcement and public safety agencies. To effectively understand, counteract, and dismantle these illicit 
networks, adopting an innovative investigative strategyintegrating both proprietary technology and

Closing Thoughts 
Taken together, the data and analysis in the Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report depict a
landscape of threats that continue to grow in volume and complexity, from ransomware attacks and data 
breaches to vulnerability exploitation and geopolitical conflict. Three themes rise above as takeaways to
navigate this challenging environment:
Anticipate and adapt to the convergence of
cyber, physical, and geopolitical threats.
As attacks increasingly target where geopolitical and commercial interests intersect
then take hybrid formsorganizations must not get caught in their traditional silos of 
functions and geographies. New levels of collaboration are required both within and
outside of organizations, from the sharing of data and analysis to defining the protocols
to act decisively on it. 
Raise the bar on the actionability of data. 
It is impractical for security teams to grow at the same rate as the attacks that weve
reported on in this report. More data isnt the solution to staying a step ahead; its about 
the quality, actionability, and tailoring of data to an organizations specific needs.
Harness the power of technology and artificial intelligence (AI)
in service of human intelligence, not in place of it.
AI is already delivering powerful capabilities to help organizations distill overwhelming 
amounts of information about potential threats. Amid the hype, however, some have lost 
sight of the central role of human intelligence in marshaling this power. The adversaries 
documented in this report will be less effective when matched with the combination of 
human expertise and technology on the other side.
By offering these threat data sets, insights and recommendations, this report has aimed to illuminate a
path forward, empowering readers not only to confront the challenges of today but also to anticipate the
risks of tomorrow.
