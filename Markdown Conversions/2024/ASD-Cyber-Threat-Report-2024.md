# Foreword

I am pleased to present the 2023–24 Annual Cyber Threat Report.

This year’s report comes amid a continued deterioration in Australia’s strategic environment. The
Indo-Pacific continues to face entrenched strategic competition, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has entered its
third year and conflict continues to unfold in the Middle East.

As the 2024 National Defence Strategy outlined, these challenges are being compounded by rapid
technological advancements. Malign actors – both state and non-state – are improving their cyber
capabilities, increasing the risk of disruptions to Australia’s critical systems, infrastructure and networks.
Grey-zone activities have also expanded in the Indo-Pacific, with malicious cyber actors continuing to
conduct espionage and spread disinformation.

This year’s report outlines the cyber threat posed to Australian governments, critical infrastructure,
businesses and households. It shows how malicious state actors and cybercriminals are continuing to
adapt their tradecraft in an attempt to compromise Australian networks.

These circumstances underline the significant role that cyber capabilities play in safeguarding our national
security and the critical role ASD continues to play in protecting Australians. That is why the Albanese
Government has committed $15–$20 billion to 2033–34 to enhance our cyber domain capabilities as part of
the 2024 Integrated Investment Program.

This significant investment will provide greater visibility of threats to critical infrastructure, increase the
resilience of our infrastructure to cyber attacks, provide new intelligence functions and enable offensive
cyber operations. The Government has also prioritised REDSPICE funding to enhance ASD’s signals
intelligence and cyber capabilities.

This report highlights the importance of strong partnerships between the public and private sectors in
defending Australians from cyber threats and making our country a harder target. It also reflects the
concrete steps we are taking to deter cybercriminals and hold them to account, with the Government
having used for the first time Australia’s autonomous cyber sanctions framework to impose cyber sanctions
on Russian cybercriminals.

Informed by ASD’s intelligence insights and partnerships, this report reinforces the importance of enhancing
our nation’s cyber defences and the need for all Australians to play their part in protecting our collective
cyber security. Reporting cybercrime, incidents and vulnerabilities remains a critical part of building a
national threat picture and enabling us to effectively counter malicious cyber actors.

This report is a key part of the Government’s efforts to raise the profile of Australia’s cyber threats to ensure
we can respond effectively to keep Australians safe.

The Hon Richard Marles MP

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence

# Executive summary

Australia faces the most complex and challenging strategic environment since the Second World War. These
strategic challenges extend to the cyber threat landscape. While advancements in critical and emerging
technologies offer significant social and economic benefits, they also improve the capabilities of malicious
cyber actors who continue to target Australia’s networks.

In FY2023–24, ASD received over 36,700 calls to its Australian Cyber Security Hotline, an increase of 12%
from the previous financial year. ASD also responded to over 1,100 cyber security incidents, highlighting the
continued exploitation of Australian systems and ongoing threat to our critical networks.

State-sponsored cyber actors persistently target Australian governments, critical infrastructure and
businesses using evolving tradecraft. These actors conduct cyber operations in pursuit of state goals,
including for espionage, in exerting malign influence, interference and coercion, and in seeking to pre-position
on networks for disruptive cyber attacks.

Over the past year, ASD co-sealed several joint advisories with international partners to highlight the
evolving operations of state-sponsored cyber actors. In February 2024, ASD joined the US and other
international partners in releasing an advisory that assessed the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is
leveraging living off the land techniques that abuse native tools and processes on systems. The PRC’s choice
of targets and pattern of behaviour is consistent with pre-positioning for disruptive effects rather than
traditional cyber espionage operations.

Russia is also adapting its techniques, including for the exploitation of cloud platforms. The evolution of
this tradecraft means that network defenders must prioritise and invest in cyber security skills, resources
and teams.

Critical infrastructure networks are an attractive target due to the sensitive data they hold and the
widespread disruption that a cyber security incident can cause on those networks. In FY2023–24, over 11% of
cyber security incidents ASD responded to related to critical infrastructure. Compromise could lead to the
disruption of critical services, affecting the economy and lives of everyday Australians.

Cybercrime is a persistent and disruptive threat. Cybercriminals are adapting to capitalise on new
opportunities, such as artificial intelligence, which reduces the level of sophistication needed for cybercriminals
to operate. In FY2023–24, business email compromise and fraud were among the top self-reported
cybercrimes for businesses and individuals in Australia. Ransomware and data theft extortion also remained a
pervasive and costly threat.

In response to this threat, ASD has worked across government, with industry and international partners
to successfully pursue cybercriminals targeting Australia. During FY2023–24, the Australian Government
for the first time used Australia’s autonomous cyber sanctions framework to sanction two Russian
citizens for their roles in cybercrime activities. These sanctions are a key tool in deterring cybercrime and
protecting Australians.

Strong partnerships are critical to building cyber resilience and making Australia a harder target. ASD
continues to monitor and adapt to the threat environment, and collaborates on a national scale to protect
Australians. An increasing number of industry and government partners are choosing to participate in
ASD programs, which provide a platform to share threat intelligence and expertise. This includes the ASD-
Microsoft initiative to connect ASD’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing platform with Microsoft’s Sentinel
platform. These types of collaborations are improving the speed and scale of information-sharing between
and among government agencies and industry partners.

In FY2023–24, ASD notified entities more than 930 times of potential malicious activity on their networks. A
robust partnership between government and industry underpins our ability to effectively defend the nation
against malicious cyber activity.

Cyber security is not set-and-forget. Organisations should consider replacing unsupported information and
communications technology (ICT) systems with secure-by-design products, consider cyber security when
implementing new technologies and follow ASD’s best-practice cyber security advice, such as the Essential
Eight. Regularly updating and applying ICT best practice builds resilience now and into the future.

Be ready to respond. Critical infrastructure organisations should adopt a stance of ‘when’ not ‘if’ a cyber
security incident will occur. All organisations should have a cyber security incident response plan and test it
regularly to ensure an effective response and fast recovery. To develop and implement a response plan, an
organisation needs to know its systems and where its most valuable data is stored.

ASD encourages every organisation and individual who observes suspicious cyber activity, incidents and
vulnerabilities to report to ReportCyber at cyber.gov.au, and to the Australian Cyber Security Hotline 1300
CYBER1 (1300 292 371). ASD provides free technical incident response advice and assistance, 24 hours a day,
7 days a week.

# Figure 1: Cyber security incidents by severity category for FY2023–24 (total 1,129)

![Cyber security incidents by severity category for FY2023–24](https://www.asd.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-05/Figure%201%20Cyber%20security%20incidents%20by%20severity%20category%20for%20FY2023%E2%80%9324.png)

ASD categorises each cyber security incident it responds to on a scale of Category 1 (C1), the most severe,
to Category 6 (C6), the least severe. Cyber security incidents are categorised on severity of impact and
significance of the organisation’s impact to Australia.

In FY2023–24, there was a slight decrease in the number of extensive compromises, while the number of
unsuccessful low-level malicious attacks increased by 10% compared with FY2022–23. There was also a 39%
increase in isolated compromises this financial year.

Coordinated low-level malicious cyber attacks fell by 77%, however this largely reflects a spike in incidents
in FY2022–23 following a specific hacktivist campaign. It does not necessarily imply that the threat of
coordinated low-level malicious cyber activity has diminished.

Incidents categorised as C3 or above involve organisations such as federal and state governments,
large organisations, academia, and supply chains. The frequency of C3 or above incidents in FY2023–24
was consistent with FY2022–23, with 14% of all incidents being categorised C3 or above. While ASD
only responded to one C2 incident, down from 5 in FY2022–23, the nature of the incident highlights the
importance of ensuring systems are updated – the C2 was through the exploitation of a known vulnerability
targeting a legacy, unpatched test server.

Over a quarter (26%) of all C3 incidents were discovered as a result of a tipper, where ASD proactively
notified the affected organisation of suspicious activity. The most common malicious activity leading to 30%
of C3 incidents was the exploitation of public facing applications.

C3 incidents commonly involved compromised accounts or credentials (23%), malware infection
other than ransomware (19%) and compromised assets, networks or infrastructure (18%). This contrasts with C3
incidents in FY2022–23, where assets, networks or infrastructure were more frequently compromised than
accounts or credentials. This suggests that malicious actors will adapt their methods to gain access.

ASD responded to over 1,100 cyber security incidents, around the
same as in the last financial year.

# Figure 3: Top 10 reporting sectors

Compared to FY2022–23, healthcare and social assistance rose to be the most frequently reported
non-government sector.

Government sectors and regulated critical infrastructure have additional reporting obligations, which may
explain the relatively high reporting rate for these sectors compared with others.

 ■ The number of extortion-related cyber security incidents responded to by ASD increased by 9%

compared to the last financial year.

 ● Around 71% of these incidents involved ransomware.

 ■ In FY2023–24, ASD responded to 53 incidents involving Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of

Service (DDoS) attacks, a decrease of 15% on the last financial year.
