## Foreword

In 3 decades since the creation of the first website, the Internet has grown to well over one billion sites. Four and a half billion users access 200 million active websites every day. The global digital data environment doubles in size every 2 years. Technology-enabled devices track and monetize all aspects of the human experience. Within the U.S. Government, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) has evolved substantially since the establishment of the Open Source Center (OSC) in 2005. The fast pace of the ongoing technology revolution poses significant challenges for a growing community of collection activities across the Defense Intelligence Enterprise (DIE).

In 2012, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) published the first U.S. DoD OSINT strategy. Since then, DoD OSINT has proven its unique value as a primary source of intelligence during multiple crisis situations.

This strategy will strengthen the DoD OSINT community and enable a true enterprise approach oriented squarely on the intelligence challenges posed by strategic competition. The central idea is to drive up the intelligence value of OSINT by unifying collection and reporting, integrating advanced technologies, and professionalizing the workforce.

Operating on behalf of the Director, DIA, as the Defense Intelligence Enterprise Manager (DIEM) for OSINT, the Defense Open Source Council (DOSC) will collaborate to set standards, track progress, and synchronize activities. We call on all Defense Intelligence Enterprise components to rise to the challenges ahead to fulfill our vision of OSINT as the “first resort” source of intelligence for decision makers and warfighters.

## Administration

This strategy updates and replaces the 2012–2017 DoD OSINT Strategy. It applies to Department of Defense components at all echelons or organizational levels that have OSINT programs and activities.

The goals, objectives, and underlying methodologies for strengthening OSINT are widely applicable to all foreign partner engagements.

The requirement for a DoD OSINT strategy is established in Department of Defense Instruction 3115.12, Open Source Intelligence, which also establishes the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as the lead component for OSINT. In December 2021, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security further designated the Director, DIA as the Defense Intelligence Enterprise Manager (DIEM) for OSINT. The DIEM-OSINT designation was codified as department policy in DoD Directive 5105.21 by the Deputy Secretary of Defense on January 25, 2023.

DIA is also tasked to lead the Defense Open Source Council (DOSC), defined in policy as the primary governance mechanism for DoD OSINT. Among the list of DOSC responsibilities is the task to establish an OSINT strategy.

The Director, DIA, tasked the Open Source Intelligence Integration Center (OSIC) to lead execution of the Agency’s DOSC and DIEM responsibilities. The Chief, OSIC also serves Chair of the DOSC, and provides primary staff secretariat support that drives the DOSC agenda.

### The Defense Open Source Council (DOSC)

Is the primary governance body for Defense OSINT and serves as a forum for the coordination and facilitation of Defense OSINT activities and programs.

Advises and reports to the DIEM for OSINT and the DIE OSINT Board of Governors on Defense issues and recommends initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Defense OSINT programs, activities, and systems.

Coordinates activities and resolves Defense OSINT issues programs and activities including Tradecraft, Training, Policy, Tools, and Data.

Coordinates Defense OSINT recommendations and activities with the National Open Source Committee (NOSC).

Establishes and maintains a Defense OSINT strategy to guide the full range of Defense OSINT efforts.

Reports to the DIEM for OSINT and the DIE OSINT BoG on issues, performance metrics, and resource recommendations, and identifies matters for BoG decision and direction.
—DIA Charter 22-004

All DoD components with OSINT programs provide representation to the DOSC. DOSC members represent their components and serve as a two-way conduit of information for developing and disseminating OSINT guidelines, standards, and procedures.

The DOSC is the primary governance body for Defense OSINT, and serves as a forum for coordination and facilitation of Defense OSINT activities and programs at the working and action officer levels.

The DOSC advises and reports to the DIEM-OSINT and the DIE OSINT Board of Governors (BoG) on issues, performance metrics, and resource recommendations; and identifies matters for BoG decision and direction.

The OSINT BoG assesses and prioritizes Defense OSINT activities and capabilities, integrates OSINT Community perspectives, and promotes a unified approach to Defense OSINT. The DIEM for OSINT may convene a Defense OSINT Executive Committee (EXCOM) to address specific issues that do not require the attention of the BoG.

## Executive Summary

Much has changed since publication of the last OSINT strategy in 2012, which coincided with a surge in mobile device sales and social media platform users that reshaped the open source landscape. The conditions were set for the digital revolution that continues today. In 2012, the newest smart phone could store 64GB of data — it would take 234 of these to store the data produced by a single person each day in 2023, and this number will double in 2 years.

Against this backdrop, the challenges ahead for Defense OSINT are daunting. The good news is the Defense Intelligence Enterprise has spent the past 10 years ramping up Open Source capabilities. The Defense Intelligence Agency, designated in 2021 as the Defense Intelligence Enterprise Manager for OSINT, through the Open Source Intelligence Integration Center (OSIC), leads a robust Defense Open Source Council (DOSC) to coordinate and synchronize OSINT across the Department.

### Vision
OSINT is the premier source of intelligence information for decisionmakers and warfighters.
