## Key Takeaways

### Prominent Cybercrime Trends

*   **Hacktivism**
    *   The most active pro-Russian hacktivist group was NoName057(16), accounting for almost 60% of all hacktivist incidents during the year. The next most active groups were Anonymous Sudan, CyberArmyRussia, Anonymous Russia and KillNet.
    *   From October 2023 to March 2024, the most active pro-Palestinian group was Cyber Toufan. The next most active groups were Cyber Av3ngers, GhostSec and BEN M’HIDI 54.
*   **Ransomware**
    *   We observed a significant global surge in ransomware attacks this year. We noted 4,429 attacks in 2023, almost double the 2,344 observed in 2022.
    *   The top five most prominent ransomware variants in 2023 were LockBit 3.0, ALPHV, CLOP, Play and 8BASE.
*   **Access**
    *   Throughout 2023, we observed and reported 5,347 instances of access vendors offering to sell compromised credentials and/or alleged unauthorized access to networks or systems.
    *   Threat actors observed with the largest number of specified access offers were those using the *Red, *Blue, *Green handles.¹
*   **Vulnerabilities**
    *   The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) noted a significant rise in the total number of documented vulnerabilities from 2022 to 2023 — an increase from 25,081 to 28,831.
    *   In 2023, Intel 471’s Vulnerability Intelligence team noted 88 zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by threat actors, a 43% increase from the 50 exploited in 2022.
*   **Malware**
    *   Throughout 2023, we observed a substantial volume of stealers, remote access trojans (RATs) and drainers on the market. Specifically, stealers accounted for 21% of all malware-related offerings, with RATs following at 13.4% and drainers at 11.2%.
    *   The dominance of information-stealer malware in the cybercrime market is expected to persist in 2024. This malware type is favored for its efficiency in extracting valuable data, profitability and the relatively low technical knowledge required to use it.

### Looming Cyber Trends

*   **Artificial Intelligence**
    *   The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) will likely result in several threats becoming more sophisticated, less detectable and overall more convincing over time. The aspects of the threat landscape most altered by AI are social-engineering campaigns, deepfakes, know-your-customer (KYC) verification bypass and chatbot abuse.
*   **“TheCom”**
    *   Operators within groups of the online ecosystem known as “TheCom” are likely behind a wave of phishing campaigns, having targeted more than 100 companies. There was a focus on the U.S. based telecommunications, technology and business process outsourcing (BPO) industries.

## Prominent Cybercrime Trends

### Hacktivism

Throughout 2023, the hacktivism scene was largely influenced by two conflicts — the ongoing war in Ukraine and the reignition of war in Gaza. We observed an ebb and flow of pro-Russian hacktivism, with activity largely targeted at organizations in countries whose governments provided economic, military and political support for Ukraine and made public declarations against Russian leaders. However, the onset of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the last quarter of the year saw increased pro-Russian involvement, mainly in support of Palestine, before tapering off toward the quarter’s conclusion. There also are several ardent groups associated with each side of the conflict in Gaza that remain active.

#### Pro-Russian Hacktivism

Russia’s war against Ukraine continued to reverberate in the cybercriminal underground in 2023. Moreover, the conflict shows no sign of ending in the near term. As the war progresses into a third year, it is important to understand the ways in which we see the conflict play out in the underground and how the former helps to shape the latter.

##### Statistics

We recorded 5,368 entities impacted by alleged hacktivist attacks throughout 2023. The most active pro-Russian group was NoName057(16), accounting for almost 60% of all hacktivist incidents during the year. The next most active groups were Anonymous Sudan, CyberArmyRussia, Anonymous Russia and KillNet. The top five most-impacted countries in descending order were Ukraine, Poland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Germany. The most-impacted industries were government, transportation, banking and securities, aviation, and health care providers and services (see Figure 1).

##### Two Years of Evolution

In the second year of the Ukraine conflict, many pro-Russian groups were established in the underground. While their activity remained largely consistent with that observed in the first year, the infamy gained by some groups and their prominent members led to self-serving decisions and rifts among delicate alliances.

Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack campaigns remained the weapon of choice for most hacktivist groups. These groups continued to target countries that showed support for Ukraine or aggression toward Russia, with Western and NATO-aligned countries receiving the brunt of these attacks.

![Figure 1: The graphic depicts a breakdown of hacktivist activity from Jan . 1, 2023, to Jan . 1, 2024 .](placeholder_for_figure_1)

Throughout the year, we observed cases of misinformation and propaganda being spread through Telegram channels. Specifically, messages of alleged “successes” of Russian armed forces on the battlefield and those of Russian hackers in cyberspace were shared. This provided evidence of a possible overlap with underground actors and the Russian state. The latter was likely keen for its propaganda to be disseminated by a myriad of sources. Collaboration with the Russian state was possibly even sought-after by some groups as a tacit relationship would likely be perceived to confer prestige upon the affiliated group, resulting in additional capabilities, funding and membership. However, since the Russian government is highly unlikely to publicly announce any cooperation with hacktivist groups, it is difficult to determine the extent of Russian state involvement.

Additionally, alliances within the pro-Russian domain were formed more frequently during the second year of the conflict compared to the first (see Figure 2). The CyberArmyRussia group formed a partnership with leaders of the Russian hacker groups 22C, CyberDragon, Federal Legion, NoName057(16), PHOENIX and SKILLNET. The alliance’s initial agenda was to target multiple entities in Ukraine, but this expanded to Western and NATO countries that aligned with Ukraine. The UserSec group also announced their cooperation with Anonymous Sudan and claimed to take aim at European airlines as well as conduct large-scale defacement attacks. These alliances allowed member groups to coordinate more closely and magnify the impact of their attacks, potentially targeting numerous entities from one country or conducting protracted attacks against a specific organization.

![Figure 2: This image depicts the links between pro-Russian hacktivist groups as of March 2024 .](placeholder_for_figure_2)

By October 2023, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict also increased to new levels. Consequently, the situation in Ukraine took a back seat and the attention of pro-Russian hacktivists gravitated to the Levant. Many of the groups appeared to use the situation for opportunistic headline grabbing, while others, such as Anonymous Sudan, conducted protracted attacks against Israel-affiliated organizations. Initially, the conflict resulted in a reduced number of attacks associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, toward the end of 2023, we observed a spike in pro-Russian attacks once more. This rise was likely prompted by tactical victories for Russia in Ukraine, an increase in bellicose rhetoric from Russian President Vladimir Putin and high-profile cyberattacks sustained by both Russia and Ukraine.

##### Assessment

The pro-Russian hacktivist landscape has fluctuated over the conflict’s two-year duration, yet the threat remains largely extant. The intensity of activity continues to be linked to international foreign policy pertaining to the conflict. As such, monitoring these events provides the clearest indicators and warnings for organizations located in the country of origin. As we move into the conflict’s third year, the status quo is unlikely to shift dramatically. Groups will likely rise and fall as member support wanes or as more lucrative opportunities present themselves to what is likely a cadre of inexperienced cyber actors.

At the start of 2024, we observed a drop in the number of groups involved with pro-Russian hacktivism. However, the increasingly common trend of groups forging alliances is likely to result in the migration of members across collectives and is likely a net neutral in terms of overall participation. Furthermore, the increased number and size of alliances will likely result in more effective campaigns, counteracting a possible decline from ailing numbers.

We predict attacks will continue in a similar vein to what we have already observed, and it is highly likely DDoS attacks will remain the weapon of choice for pro-Russian hacktivists. This preference is likely due to the high impact and ease of use of such attacks, combined with the low barrier of entry they provide cybercriminals. Moreover, governments and critical national infrastructure (CNI) are highly likely to continue to be prime targets for pro-Russian hacktivists as we progress into 2024.

### Israel, Palestine

On Oct. 7, 2023, members of the Palestinian militant movement Hamas launched a surprise attack from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, plunging the region into conflict. Global condemnation and hacktivism swiftly followed the violence on the ground. While many sought to draw parallels with the Russian hacktivism scene — and initial signs indicated that to be the case — pro-Israeli/Palestinian threat actors have not maintained the intensity and longevity of activity displayed by pro-Russian hacktivists.

##### Statistics

At the start of the conflict, open source trackers estimated the amount of hacktivist groups involved to be 118 to 137 pro-Palestinian and 19 pro-Israeli. This number has likely increased since, however, the intensity of related hacktivism has plateaued and possibly diminished as hacktivist groups that sought to leverage the conflict for publicity returned to their previous fields of interest. We monitor threats to Israel and Palestine using the 6.2.5.4 Israel and 6.2.5.9 Palestine General Intelligence Requirements (GIRs). Intel 471’s reporting on the regions — including Breach Alerts and Information Reports — saw a rise in Q4 2023 in correlation with the conflict (See Figure 3). Toward the end of 2023 and start of 2024, most activity observed was low-level or, when investigated, was unfounded or appeared to relate to historical breaches.

![Figure 3: The graphs depict the number of Information and Breach Reports published that were tagged with the GIRs for Israel and Palestine.](placeholder_for_figure_3)

#### Conflict Provides Opportunities for Iran and Associated Groups

The conflict is likely of great interest to the Iranian regime and reports of Iranian interference were prominent throughout the fourth quarter. On Dec. 24, 2023, the Israeli Cyber Directorate published a report that claimed 15 groups associated with Iran conducted cyberattacks against Israeli entities. Additionally, several hacktivist groups we reported were linked to the Iranian state. For example, the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS)-linked GURDIUM group claimed responsibility for a spate of DDoS attacks on Israeli and Saudi entities. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)-associated Cyber Av3ngers group impacted both Israel- and U.S.-based infrastructure through the compromise of Israeli-made Unitronics Vision Series programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The latter captured many headlines and prompted three U.S. congressmen to write a letter to the U.S. Justice Department requesting them to investigate the attack.

![Figure 4: The graph depicts the most significant pro-Palestinian actors by number of posts from October 2023 to March 2024 with intelligence value according to SMEs.](placeholder_for_figure_4)

##### Cyber Toufan Group

The Cyber Toufan group appeared as the most active pro-Palestinian group from October 2023 to March 2024 (see Figure 4). The group is part of the Anonymous #OpIsrael movement and was linked to the Iranian state by researchers. Much of its success can be attributed to its breach of the Israel-based data storage and software provider Signature-IT Ltd. which was allegedly carried out in November 2023. Following the attack, the group claimed to have impacted 150 entities, destroyed databases and servers, and extracted significant amounts of data. The group initially listed 38 alleged victims, many of which were in the national and regional government industries. We then issued 24 further Breach Alerts, demonstrating Cyber Toufan was highly impactful throughout the fourth quarter of 2023 (see Figure 3). Furthermore, open source reporting indicated the group had some success in destructive activity, such as wiping databases. In late December 2023, the group claimed not all of its leaks were a result of the Signature-IT breach, possibly indicating Cyber Toufan was not happy with the credit it received for its endeavors. At the start of the year, the group’s impact diminished in line with the wider pro-Palestinian movement.

##### Assessment

Hacktivism associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has cooled after the opening months, a trend likely to continue until a baseline is met. However, Israel has long been a target for several actors, and the conflict presents an opportunity to join forces with similar groups to enact real disruption. Equally, nation states have leveraged hacktivist groups to apply lateral, non-escalatory pressure in the past, and Iran will likely encourage the hacktivist groups it has influence over to disrupt Israeli infrastructure and provoke international condemnation of the Israeli government. Furthermore, the Iranian regime will be keen to leverage its cyber assets to monitor sentiment related to the conflict and look to use any insight gained to maneuver neighboring countries away from Israel and the West. However, these attacks will likely have limited impact and are unlikely to be coordinated enough to affect the situation on the ground.

### Ransomware

Disclaimer: The figures in this report refer only to the victims whose details were listed on data leak sites and reported by Intel 471. It is highly likely the actual number of victims is much greater since these sites typically do not disclose the identities of those who pay ransoms within a specified time period. Furthermore, we accept that not all groups who use data leak sites to extort their victims always use encryption through ransomware; however, due to the similarities in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), we capture their activity in our ransomware coverage.

![Figure 5: This timeline depicts key ransomware events in 2023 and early 2024.](placeholder_for_figure_5)

Ransomware remained the principal threat in 2023 as attacks increased at an alarming rate marked by numerous high-profile incidents (see Figure 5). We observed more than 4,000 attacks in 2023, almost double the ransomware instances observed in 2022. As we progress through 2024, it is important to understand the evolving threat landscape and the impact ransomware attacks have on a range of entities.

![Figure 6: This graph depicts ransomware variant activity in 2023 reported by Intel 471. *Note: Some variants were attributed to the parent strain.](placeholder_for_figure_6)

#### Ransomware Activity by Variant

In 2023, our reporting identified 68 ransomware variants, an increase of 19 variants compared to 2022. Once again, LockBit stood out as the most prevalent, impacting 981 victims. This was more than double the number impacted by the next variant, ALPHV, which impacted 427 victims. The remaining 67 variants each accounted for less than 9% of the total number of observed ransomware attacks (see Figure 6).

#### Ransomware Activity by Region

While ransomware can affect any organization, in any area of the world, some ransomware groups take aim at certain regions. North America was the most-targeted region overall in both 2022 and 2023. While all reported regions had an upsurge in attacks in 2023, North America had a notable 125.3% increase, followed by Europe with 67.7%, Asia with 46.8%, South America with 40.9%, Oceania with 55.9%, Africa with 87.2%, the Middle East with 63.5%, Central America with 61.9% and the Caribbean with 114.3% (see Figure 7).

![Figure 7: This map depicts ransomware attacks and the most prominent ransomware groups per region in 2022 and 2023 .](placeholder_for_figure_7)

#### Ransomware Groups Suffer Disruptions, Cease Operations

We observed a series of disruptions impacting operations of several ransomware groups during 2023.

*   **Hive**: In late January 2023, we observed U.S. authorities allegedly seize Tor domain names associated with the Hive ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program after discovering its victim shaming blogs and victim communication website displayed a placeholder indicating the law enforcement action. Following these reports and rumors in the underground community, U.S. authorities confirmed a large-scale disruption operation against the RaaS. The U.S. FBI reported the domain names and a wider computer infrastructure were taken down, and decryption keys that allowed victims to access their encrypted data also were recovered.
*   **Trigona**: In mid-October 2023, the Trigona ransomware group experienced an attack on its infrastructure. The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance (UCA) team allegedly exfiltrated and subsequently erased data from the ransomware gang’s administrative panel, victim shaming and data leak blog, internal servers and backups.
*   **Ragnar Locker**: In mid-October 2023, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) carried out joint law enforcement action against the Ragnar Locker ransomware group. This action resulted in a takedown of the group’s infrastructure and an arrest of the main developer of the ransomware.
*   **NoEscape**: In December 2023, the NoEscape ransomware group’s blog went offline for the second time in a few months. Several actors later accused the administrator of the RaaS of conducting an exit scam and allegedly stealing US $12 million.

##### ALPHV Disruption Leads to Exit Scam

In late December 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a statement that confirmed the seizure of the ALPHV aka ALPHV-ng, BlackCat, Noberus RaaS affiliate program. Despite the seizure, the group continued to post alleged victims to a new name-and-shame blog until March 3, 2024, when the blog and the group’s affiliate management panel became unavailable. The same day, the actor notchy filed a complaint against an operator of ALPHV that accused the operator of a scam attempt. Specifically, notchy claimed that the ALPHV operator had appropriated a US $22 million ransom payment owed to them and their team after it breached a major U.S. health care organization. The actor also claimed that their RaaS account had been suspended shortly after the victim made the payment.

On March 4, 2024, an administrator, the actor ALPHV, claimed to be aware of the outage and stated that work to solve the issues was in progress. However, the message was later changed to indicate the source code was for sale for US $5 million. On March 5, 2024, the actor ransom, who promoted the ALPHV RaaS on the RAMP cybercrime forum, announced the alleged seizure of ALPHV RaaS operations. Subsequently, ALPHV’s data leak site became available and displayed a similar seizure notice to the one observed in December 2023. The actor later indirectly admitted ALPHV operators failed to transfer the affiliate’s share for the ransomware attack against the health care entity and blamed unspecified issues arising from law enforcement intervention. The actor ransom expressed the intent to sell the source code of the program and claimed negotiations already were in progress.

##### LockBit Appears to Weather Initial Disruption

The LockBit RaaS program also suffered disruption from law enforcement at the start of 2024. In late February, the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) conducted a disruption operation against the RaaS in cooperation with partner law enforcement agencies. The task force took control of LockBit’s victim shaming data leak blog and control panel, and affiliates attempting to log in to the panel were presented with a message that indicated traces of their criminal activity were recorded by law enforcement agents. Officers allegedly obtained access to key infrastructure that belonged to the LockBit group and published screenshots of the compromised LockBit back-end infrastructure. They later released about 194 internally generated LockBit affiliate handles. The U.S. stated that sanctions would be imposed on those involved with the LockBit RaaS and two individuals reportedly were taken into custody in Poland and Ukraine. Simultaneously, officials at the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the designation of two Russian individuals affiliated with LockBit, which included Artur Sungatov and Ivan Gennadievich Kondratiev aka Bassterlord, FishEye personas.

The leader of the LockBit RaaS, the actor LockBit aka LockbitSupp, eventually posted a lengthy statement on the RAMP underground forum that admitted the actor’s own negligence with regard to network security. They claimed an improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer vulnerability — CVE-2023-3824 — was exploited by the NCA to gain access to the group’s infrastructure. Additionally, LockbitSupp stated the LockBit RaaS victim name-and-shame blog was available at several new Tor domains and listed multiple new victim organizations. The actor also indicated there would be reprisals for the disruption, stating an intent to attack the government sector more often and threatening to purchase compromised network access credentials related to government, educational and nonprofit organizations.

##### Assessment

The aforementioned activity related to ransomware group disruption in 2023 indicates law enforcement and intelligence agencies continue to improve anti-ransomware tactics dedicated to hampering and dismantling ransomware infrastructure. However, ransomware groups almost certainly will simultaneously continue to evolve their TTPs to at least maintain — if not improve upon — their profitable cybercriminal operations. Regardless, disruption operations against the top two RaaS programs of 2023 are noteworthy.

That said, the impact of these actions can take time to fully materialize. In the case of ALPHV, the group at first appeared to shake off the effects of the December 2023 disruption and continued operations for three additional months before folding. We assessed ALPHV almost certainly conducted an exit scam and used previous law enforcement action as cover for the dissolution. While it is likely ALPHV could have regained full operational effectiveness, the reputational damage sustained possibly resulted in mature affiliates moving away from the service. This was evidenced in the reduction of “high-value” victims added to its name-and-shame blog in January 2024 and February 2024; almost half of the alleged new victims on these blogs were small companies with lower revenues. This likely resulted in a drop in revenue and contributed to the operators’ decision to conduct the exit scam.

In relation to the LockBit disruption, it is very rare that a ransomware group’s collapse follows the same pattern as a previous example. However, the proximity in time to the collapse of ALPHV invites the drawing of parallels. To avoid a similar fate, we assess it is likely that LockBit initially sought to limit reputational damage by admitting fault for the security shortcomings and providing an assessment of how the network was penetrated. Additionally, the speed with which the LockBit group was able to reestablish the victim shaming blog and the addition of new victims likely reassured some affiliates. However, the victims posted were likely breached prior to the disruption and as such are an unreliable metric to assess the group’s operational effectiveness post-disruption. It is almost certain affiliates will be anxious about reengaging with LockBit’s infrastructure and will likely lay low before returning to their pre-disruption pattern of life.

Despite the takedown operations, ransomware remains a major threat to organizations worldwide and this is highly unlikely to change in 2024. We observed a significant global surge in ransomware attacks from 2022 to 2023, more than doubling the number of incidents and resulting in an increase observed across most regions. Despite indications that North America strengthened its security posture in recent years, it did not appear to deter cybercriminals from impacting the region.

There are several drivers for the continued focus on this region, for example, the prevalence of successful corporations based in the U.S. present lucrative outcomes for successful ransomware attacks. What is more, there is a prominence of Russian actors in the ransomware world who often prefer to target Western entities — the U.S. in particular — due to ideological and nationalist inclinations. As such, we assess North American organizations will likely remain at high risk of ransomware attacks as we continue through 2024.

### Access

Disclaimer: This section includes data collected from Information Reports (IRs) and Breach Alerts and is not representative of all access possibly offered across the underground. Some of the access offers captured in our data points remain unverified at the time of this report and we included raw observables as part of the analysis of emerging threats and common TTPs. Additionally, we acknowledge not all access offers can be clearly or simply designated within one of our two categories. As a result, some analytical assessments are made on certain access offers to determine better categorization.

#### Access Overview

The sale of access continued to grow in 2023 and remains one of the principal enablers for a multitude of cybercrime. We observed and reported 5,347 instances of access vendors offering to sell compromised credentials and/or alleged unauthorized access to networks or systems in 2023 (see Figure 8 on the next page).

#### Specified, Wholesale Access Offers

We previously introduced new terminology to better convey our thinking and differentiate the types of access seen in the underground into two categories: wholesale and specified.

Wholesale access is purported access to a network, resource or service by means of compromised access credentials, exploitation of a software vulnerability or misconfiguration or via similar means for which no indicator exists that a threat actor verified the validity of access as operational. It typically is sold en masse where an actor sacrifices quality assurance for timely sales.

*   In 2023, we observed 4,272 wholesale access offers from access vendors in the underground marketplace. The top three sectors most impacted by these offers in descending order were public, professional services and consulting, and consumer and industrial products. The top three countries most impacted

![Figure 8: This image depicts the sectors and countries most impacted by both specified and wholesale access offers in 2023. The image also shows all access offers per threat actor .](placeholder_for_figure_8)

by these offers in descending order were the U.S., Brazil and Germany. The most impacted countries are likely reflective of opportunistic attacks rather than specific targeting.

Specified access is purported access to a network, resource or service by means of compromised access credentials, exploitation of a software vulnerability or misconfiguration or via similar means for which an indicator does exist that a threat actor verified the validity of access as operational. It typically is sold individually or in small batches with a level of quality assurance.

*   In 2023, we observed and reported 1,076 offers of specified access listed for sale in the underground marketplace. The top three sectors most impacted by these offers in descending order were public; technology, media and telecommunications; and consumer and industrial products. The top three countries most impacted by these offers in descending order were the U.S., Brazil and Spain. Again, this is likely to be the result of opportunistic attacks.

#### Tactics, Techniques, Procedures Observed

![Figure 9: This image depicts the observed TTPs from threat actors offering compromised access in 2023 .](placeholder_for_figure_9)

We observed access brokers display several TTPs in 2023 (see Figure 9). This included different reconnaissance techniques such as identifying potential targets via Google dork complex advanced operator queries, the Advanced IP Scanner utility and the SoftPerfect Network Scanner tool, as well as seeking vulnerable and exposed assets using search engines such as FOFA, Google, Shodan and ZoomEye. We also saw threat actors use reverse-proxy methods via secure shell (SSH) protocol-based tunnels to maintain persistence and commercially available and open source proxy client tools to redirect traffic to a victim’s network.

Initial access brokers (IABs) allegedly leveraged Metasploit Meterpreter payloads, undisclosed socket secure internet protocol (SOCKS)-based tools and web shells to interact with compromised victim assets, as well as the Mimikatz pass-the-hash function to move laterally inside a victim’s network and open remote desktop protocol (RDP) sessions. We also saw one threat actor employ the Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)-based ALFA TEaM Shell web shell to maintain access and interact with compromised websites, and another use the Router Scan tool to gather information and exploit vulnerable hosts, brute-force weak access credentials and use public exploits. Other IABs also allegedly conducted brute-force, credential-stuffing and password-spraying attacks to gain access to accounts, with some likely using the NLBrute RDP brute-forcing tool. Additional tools used within the access market allegedly included the CrackMapExec, Impacket, Microsoft Windows PsExec, Rubeus and “vssadmin” utilities to facilitate authentication-based attacks.

Vulnerabilities and exploits also continue to play a large role in the process of obtaining unauthorized access. Threat actors allegedly leveraged the open source “ysoserial” tool to exploit unsafe Java object deserialization and exploited server misconfigurations as well as common vulnerabilities in exposed assets, such as a command-injection flaw that could lead to remote code execution (RCE) in certain conditions.

#### Assessment

The access market appeared to grow in popularity throughout 2023. The first half of the year saw averages of about 350 offers per month, which then surged to an average of 540 per month in the latter half. However, December 2023, January 2024 and February 2024 averaged about 192 offers per month. Consequently, there is a possibility that 2022’s and 2023’s IAB phenomena provided an opportunity for threat actors to advertise backlogs of access obtained over the course of their activity. Now that the “low-hanging fruit” has been sold and used, we could see a drop in the advertisement of unique, never-before-offered bulk credentials in 2024.

Regardless, access vendors in 2023 remained key enablers of cybercrime by supplying initial access points into networks and systems for further fraudulent activity to occur and almost certainly will continue to do so in 2024. Moreover, as the market’s traction continued to rise in 2023 and the number of access offers increased, we observed a similar increase in previously advertised access. As such, although wholesale access offers far exceeded specified access offers in 2023, we continue to assess the large volume of access offered by wholesalers does not always suggest or relate to the quality. Many wholesale access brokers likely seek a quick and easy profit by offering large data dumps likely derived from malware logs and/ or reselling the findings of other actors rather than working to discover new access on their own.

Conversely, actors offering specified access appear to have the ability to carry out a variety of reconnaissance efforts, develop different resources to obtain initial access to systems and networks, occasionally maintain their foothold and exfiltrate an array of information. Therefore, vendors claiming to offer specified access continue to present a greater threat as they likely possess a higher level of sophistication compared to those offering wholesale access in bulk. Additionally, the collaborative relationship between ransomware groups and access brokers evolved throughout 2023 and likely will continue to develop into 2024. Access vendors
