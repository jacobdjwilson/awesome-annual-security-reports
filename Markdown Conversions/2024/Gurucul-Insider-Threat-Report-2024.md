## Rising Tide of Insider Attacks

We asked respondents to rate their organization’s vulnerability to insider threats, and the results show a notable increase compared to last year’s results. The frequency of insider attacks experienced within an organization provides critical insights into gaps in insider risk management.

The survey results show a concerning increase in reported incidents from 2023 to 2024. In 2024, only 17% of organizations reported no insider attacks, a significant decrease from 40% in 2023. A significant number of organizations reported a small number of attacks (1-5), remaining relatively stable at 32%, compared to 35% in 2023. However, the number of organizations experiencing 6-10 attacks nearly doubled to 25% from 13%, and those reporting 11-20 attacks saw a dramatic increase to 21% from just 4% in 2023. The percentage of organizations experiencing more than 20 attacks decreased slightly from 8% in 2023 to 5% in 2024.

This dramatic shift suggests an increasing frequency and awareness of insider attacks, echoing other findings in this report where 11% of respondents felt extremely vulnerable to such threats, up from 5%. The rise in reported incidents also indicates that organizations are becoming better at detecting insider attacks that previously might have gone unnoticed. Additionally, 48% of respondents confirmed that overall, insider attacks have become more frequent over the past 12 months, while only 19% observed a decrease.

To combat this growing threat, organizations should invest in robust insider threat management programs that incorporate advanced detection technologies to identify and mitigate suspicious insider activities early. Continuous monitoring, comprehensive incident response plans, and fostering a culture of security awareness among employees are essential steps in reducing the frequency of insider attacks.

## Costly Consequences of Insider Attacks

Evaluating the financial impact of insider attacks is important for understanding the full scope of their repercussions. It also strengthens the case for robust investments in insider risk management and related solutions.

When asked to estimate the average cost of remediation after an insider attack, the most common response, noted by 32% of organizations, was an estimated cost in the range of $100K to $499K.

Following this, 27% of respondents estimated their costs to be between $500K and $1M, while 21% reported costs ranging from $1M to $2M. Additionally, 12% indicated remediation costs of less than $100K, and 8% even estimate costs exceeding $2M.

These findings underscore the substantial financial impact of insider attacks, with many organizations incurring costs in the hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Considering that 51% of organizations experienced six or more attacks in the last 12 months, the financial damage can be severe. For example, with 10 attacks costing $1 million each, the total could easily exceed $10 million. This aligns with broader industry trends, where the average cost of insider threats continues to rise due to the growing sophistication of these attacks.

## Challenges in Detecting and Preventing Insider Attacks

The difficulty of detecting and preventing insider attacks compared to external cyber attacks reveals critical insights into the complexities of managing internal threats.

According to the survey, 37% of respondents find detecting and preventing insider attacks more difficult than dealing with external cyber attacks. This reveals a notable improvement from 2023 when 48% of organizations found insider attacks more difficult to detect than external ones. A majority, 55%, believe the difficulty level is about the same (compared to 44% in 2023), while only 8% consider insider attacks easier to manage than external ones.

This data underscores the inherent complexities in identifying and mitigating insider threats. Unlike external attacks, which often come from identifiable sources and follow recognizable patterns, insider attacks originate from trusted individuals within the organization, making them more challenging to detect. Insiders have legitimate access to systems and data, allowing them to bypass many traditional security measures undetected.

Organizations must enhance their insider threat detection and prevention strategies to address these challenges. Implement advanced monitoring solutions, such as User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), to identify anomalous activities that may indicate insider threats. Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) platforms can further automate insider incident response and prioritize high-risk threats. Additionally, fostering a culture of security awareness among employees and conducting regular training can help mitigate the risk of insider attacks by making all staff vigilant against potential threats.

Organizations might also consider phased implementations or pilot programs to manage initial expenses while demonstrating value early on.

Resource limitations, noted by 27% of respondents, include insufficient staff to implement and maintain tools and a lack of expertise or specialized skills required to operate them. Investing in ongoing training and development for cybersecurity teams to build the necessary expertise is crucial to address this challenge. To help reduce the burden on staff we recommend seeking out tools that are more intuitive to use and that reduce alert triage and false positives by providing a complete case of evidence with context and advanced behavior analytics. Collectively this can streamline investigations, expedite response, and improve operational efficiency. Additionally, managed security services can supplement internal capabilities, ensuring that tools are effectively implemented and maintained without overburdening existing staff.

Compliance and privacy concerns, reported by 26% of respondents, also pose significant hurdles. Regulatory requirements and concerns about infringing on employee privacy complicate the implementation of comprehensive monitoring systems. This challenge is particularly acute in regions with stringent data protection laws, where balancing security and privacy becomes a delicate task. Adopting privacy-by-design principles ensures that compliance and privacy are embedded in security practices from the outset. Staying informed about regulatory changes and working with legal and human resource experts can help navigate these challenges more effectively. Transparent communication with employees about the importance and benefits of monitoring can further alleviate privacy concerns.

Executive management and policy issues are cited by 20% of respondents, indicating that a lack of prioritization by management and ineffective internal policies are significant obstacles. This highlights the need for stronger executive support and more effective policy frameworks to ensure that insider threat management is given the attention it deserves. Securing stronger executive support by clearly communicating the risks and potential impacts of insider threats on the organization can help address this. Developing and enforcing effective internal policies that emphasize the importance of insider threat management ensures it receives the necessary attention.

By tackling these obstacles head-on, organizations can better position themselves to implement effective insider threat management strategies and protect their sensitive information and systems.

## Vulnerability to Insider Threats

Understanding organizational vulnerability to insider threats is crucial, as it highlights potential weaknesses that could be exploited by insiders and informs strategies to close gaps in insider risk management.

We asked respondents to rate their organization’s vulnerability to insider threats, and the results show a notable shift in perceptions to being more vulnerable. The most noticeable shift in 2024 was that 11% of respondents felt their organizations were extremely vulnerable, a significant increase from 5% in 2023. Similarly, those who felt very vulnerable rose to 25% from 21%. As a result, the moderately vulnerable category shifted from 48% in 2023 to 35% in 2024. Slightly vulnerable responses saw a slight increase, moving from 25% to 26%, while those who felt not at all vulnerable increased only marginally from 1% to 3%.

This data indicates a growing awareness and concern about insider threats among organizations, with a marked shift from moderate to higher levels of perceived vulnerability. The increase suggests that organizations are becoming more cognizant of the potential damage insider attacks can cause— a change in perception that is likely due to high-profile incidents and improving internal threat detection capabilities.

Organizations should prioritize enhancing their insider threat detection and response strategies to address these growing concerns. Implementing comprehensive security programs that include continuous monitoring, advanced analytics, and employee training can help mitigate these risks.
