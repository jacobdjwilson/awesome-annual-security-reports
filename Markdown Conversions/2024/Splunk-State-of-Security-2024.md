The Race to Harness AI
State of Security 2024\|Splunk
As a security professional and leader for over twenty years, Ive witnessed the industry evolve many times over. But this time is 
different. Cybersecurity is rushing into a new frontier one rife with opportunity and risk with the rise of generative AI. In Splunks 
2024 State of Security Report, we found that many CISOs and practitioners are blazing this trail without looking back. But theyre 
also not sure whats ahead, given new compliance regulations and their impact on CISO accountability. 
In todays cyber environment, we expect security professionals to explore how generative AI can empower their resilience 
journey and with a staggering 93% of respondents claiming adoption, many already see it as a critical point of innovation. 
Theyre using generative AI to build better cyber defenses, execute more informed decisions, and fill critical skills gaps. At the 
same time, at least one\-third of respondents have no generative AI policies. And their biggest reported fear? AI\-powered attacks.
Meanwhile, more punitive incident reporting rules by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the E.U.s NIS2 are 
holding the CISO community to greater accountability. But we believe security professionals will also discover new opportunities 
to reshape their roles and teams. For CISOs, that means asserting priorities in the boardroom, and for security practitioners, it 
calls for tighter collaboration with ITOps, engineering, and cloud teams to expand visibility, minimize response times, and take 
resilience to new levels. 
While security professionals continue to forge this new path, at Splunk we are excited about the 
potential of generative AI for defenders and encouraged by how quickly security priorities are 
becoming business priorities.

The state of security in 2024 is a bit of a contradiction. 
Despite the obstacles in security professionals 
paths stringent compliance requirements, escalating 
geopolitical tensions, and a more sophisticated threat 
landscape the industry is making progress.
Many organizations report that cybersecurity is 
becoming easier to manage compared to previous 
years. Organizations collaborate more and detect 
threats faster, and most have the authority and 
resources to solve the issues they face. 
Complete victory remains elusive, however, as 
defenders attempt to outrun adversaries in the 
race to harness generative AI. Security teams are 
understandably concerned that generative AI will 
intensify the impact of the same attacks theyve 
skillfully thwarted for years.
We think defenders are up to the task. The full impact 
of generative AI on cybersecurity may be unknown, but 
one thing we do know: The race is on.

Cybersecurity is trending easier over time
Being a defender means you rarely see the fruits of your labor. Its 
only natural to wonder: is any of this working? When it comes to 
keeping up with cybersecurity requirements, respondents were 
almost evenly split: 41% say it has become easier, while 46% find it 
more difficult.
However, the macro trends paint a hopeful picture. Since Splunks 
State of Security 2022, managing cybersecurity is trending easier. 
This perception may be surprising given increasing environmental 
complexity and attack sophistication. But its likely easier for 
organizations with well\-established security controls and 
processes to stay ahead of threat actors relying on tried\-and\-true 
attack strategies.
Collaboration may be one reason cybersecurity is getting easier: 
87% of respondents say they are working more closely with 
other teams compared to a year ago. Three\-quarters (75%) of 
respondents are joining forces more with IT operations this year. 
In addition, 54% are collaborating more with software engineering 
and when security starts early in the design and coding phases, 
addressing vulnerabilities becomes more manageable. 
Organizations are also detecting threats faster. Fifty\-five 
percent of respondents estimate their mean time to detect 
(MTTD) distruption\-causing incidents as 14 days or less. This 
marks a significant improvement from last year, when only 
28% of respondents estimated detection within the same 
timeframe. However, this is still too much time for attackers to 
access systems.

But the battle isnt over
Among those who say cybersecurity is getting more difficult, 38% 
cite threat landscape sophistication as the reason why. Geopolitical 
tensions and cyber warfare are on the rise. IoT, AI, and multicloud 
environments are increasing data volumes exponentially. And as a 
result, organizations still trying to implement basic cybersecurity 
controls will struggle to secure additional assets and endpoints. 
Theyll also have a harder time protecting against simple human 
errors, like misconfigurations, which rank as this years top 
threat vector.
Tighter compliance requirements also raise the stakes, particularly 
for security executives who are now personally on the hook 
for their organizations violations. Twenty\-eight percent agree 
that regulatory compliance is making the job harder. And new 
government mandates will only ratchet up the pressure. 
Similar to previous years, 27% of security teams struggle to address 
emergencies and dedicate adequate time to improve cybersecurity, 
indicating a lack of long\-term strategy and investment. A barrage of 
security alerts also makes it difficult to keep up 26% agree the 
volume is troublesome.
AI rises above the clouds
One of the most notable findings in this years survey is that AI hype 
is on par with reality. Nearly half (44%) of respondents cite AI as 
among their three main initiatives in 2024, surpassing cloud security.
While security teams recognize the many benefits of AI, so do threat 
actors that are unencumbered by laws and policies. When asked 
whether AI will tip the scales in favor of defenders or adversaries, 
respondents are almost evenly divided: 45% predict adversaries will 
benefit most, while 43% say defenders will come out on top. 
The meteoric rise of generative AI sparks the imagination of what 
could be, but it also raises serious questions about what will be. 
What will it mean for the SOC? Will organizations introduce policies 
to encourage safe and effective usage? How will they enforce those 
policies without hampering innovation? The answers are starting to 
take shape.

Entering the AI 
gold rush
During the California Gold Rush, hundreds of thousands of prospectors 
with dreams of striking it rich migrated west. Similarly, todays 
generative AI boom involves chasing opportunity at breakneck speed 
into an unknown frontier, where the possibilities feel endless and the 
risks perilous. Everybody wants to strike the mother lode and enjoy 
first\-mover advantage. Its possible it just takes a little digging.

The promise and possibility of generative AI
Generative AI has gone mainstream, and organizations are actively 
implementing it to transform their businesses. From serving 
up personalized customer recommendations in e\-commerce 
to mapping the human brain to imitating the brushstrokes of 
Rembrandt, generative AI boasts an assortment of use cases in 
nearly every industry. 
These arent mere speculations. Ninety\-three percent of 
respondents report that line\-of\-business end users rely on public 
generative AI tools to help them do their jobs. This creates more 
work for security teams who protect the business from generative 
AI\-related vulnerabilities such as data leakage. 
Optimism about generative AI is powerful enough to sway even 
the most skeptical security professionals. Adoption is nearly as 
high among security teams as the overall business, with 91% of 
respondents using public generative AI. Whats more, theyre rooting 
for generative AIs success, with 46% declaring that generative AI 
will be game\-changing for their security teams.
The race to harness generative AI is so intense that 50% of 
respondents say their organization is in the midst of developing a 
formal plan for using generative AI for cybersecurity, but the plan 
isnt complete or agreed upon. 
Security and innovation can go hand in hand if done correctly. At the 
same time, we wonder if pressure from the business or board or 
just good ol fear of missing out is driving generative AI adoption 
among security teams.
Just two years ago, it wouldve been almost preposterous to ask organizations 
how many end users are using public generative AI tools but today, 
generative AI in the business is table stakes.

Generative AI policy is uncharted territory
Move fast and break things might sound counterintuitive to 
most security practitioners, but it could be the right philosophy as 
organizations seek innovation at speed. And while security teams 
rarely turn down a chance to write a policy, 34% of organizations 
do not have a generative AI policy in place, despite its high 
adoption rate.
Companies that clamp down too tightly on the use of generative 
AI risk not only falling behind their competitors, but also leaving 
themselves open to the threat actors who wont hesitate to use 
these tools, says Shannon Davis, principal security strategist at 
Splunk SURGe. 
If we learned anything from cloud or IoT adoption, a lack of process 
and planning could come back to haunt security teams. The push 
from the business to haphazardly follow these trends resulted in 
undesirable consequences, such as non\-compliant clouds paid on 
personal credit cards, or unsecured IoT devices rife with software 
vulnerabilities. Security teams must balance the speed of innovation 
with thoughtful and sustainable processes. 
Robust policies depend on understanding the implications of a 
technology, yet 65% of respondents admit they lack education 
around generative AI. Teaching the rest of the organization 
about generative AI shouldnt be the sole burden of the 
cybersecurity team, however. 
Organizations should form a cross\-functional governance board to 
oversee the development and adoption of AI with a comprehensive 
framework for responsible AI, says Hao Yang,
VP of AI at Splunk.
The influence of generative AI is wide\-reaching, so navigating it 
calls for a range of perspectives and specializations. Splunks AI 
committee, for example, spans multiple business units, including 
product and technology, legal, privacy, security, human resources, 
go\-to\-market, and marketing. 
Of course, thoughtful security policies dont necessarily translate to 
complete prevention, but they can go a long way to minimize data 
leakage and other new vulnerabilities.
The long arm of the law comes for generative AI
Like internal governance, the frontier of generative AI remains 
relatively untamed and unregulated by any enforceable laws 
for now. However, AI compliance is starting to take shape. 
For example, The European Unions AI Act aims to introduce a 
common regulatory framework based on risk categories. In 2023, 
the European Parliament amended its initial proposal to include 
generative AI, which must comply with certain transparency 
requirements. These requirements include registering the 
foundation model in a database and developing and retaining 
technical documentation. 
In the United States, the Biden Administrations AI Bill of 
Rights suggests that users should be notified when they are 
communicating with an automated system, and allows to opt out 
and interact with a real person instead. These guidelines could 
foreshadow future government action.
This impending tsunami of government regulation may be why 
45% of respondents name better alignment with compliance 
requirements as a top area for improvement, right behind data 
leakage. Getting ahead of this trend requires a renewed focus on 
internal compliance controls. 
Organizations should form a cross\-functional 
governance board to oversee the development

What generative AI use cases may look like in practice 
Identifying risks
Generative AI can enhance risk\-based 
alerting by quickly aggregating diverse 
datasets to provide security analysts 
with alerts that are context\-rich. Large 
language models (LLMs) help to deliver this 
information at a speed and efficiency far 
beyond human capability.

Threat intelligence analysis
LLMs can determine the indicators of

described in a threat intelligence report. 
This would save intelligence teams from a 
lot of drudgery and enable them to perform 
deeper analysis faster.
Threat detection and prioritization 
Prioritizing and triaging alerts are tasks 
particularly susceptible to analyst 
misclassification, fatigue and human errors. 
Generative AI can parallel process multiple 
threats while improving accuracy.
Summarizing security data 
Generative AI can summarize quickly, 
thoroughly and accurately to help security 
teams save time and keep up with news and 
information, like Bidens Executive Order on 
Improving the Nations Cybersecurity.
Generative AI as the security sidekick
Perceptions of generative AI are evolving fast. Just eight 
months ago, only 17% of respondents in our CISO report 
said generative AI would advantage defenders. Now, 
almost half (43%) feel the same way. 
More and more vendors are incorporating generative 
AI into their products, demonstrating its use in security 
workflows, and defenders are starting to see the 
possibilities. While the potential for novel generative AI\-
fueled attacks and AI poisoning remains a possibility, they 
have yet to become commonplace. 
Defenders seem optimistic and agree that generative AI is 
a good match for several cybersecurity use cases, naming 
threat intelligence analysis and risk identification as the 
top two applications.

Solving the cybersecurity skills shortage
Skilled professionals sit at the heart of any SOC, and many 
organizations are still coping with talent shortages. Generative AI 
could offer some breathing room to address this very real need. 
Eighty\-six percent of organizations believe generative AI will help 
them hire more entry\-level cybersecurity talent, and 58% say it 
would help onboard entry\-level talent faster. Ninety percent of 
respondents say that entry\-level staff can lean on generative AI 
to help develop their skills in the SOC once theyre hired which 
could include fundamental tasks such as writing a Python script or 
spinning up test environments. 
Generative AI will also be a force multiplier for seasoned security 
professionals. Sixty\-five percent believe it will make them more 
productive, enabling experienced practitioners to more easily 
synthesize news and information, and accelerate research and 
detection engineering. 
And while the fear of AI replacing jobs isnt entirely unfounded 
about half (49%) say generative AI will eliminate some existing 
security roles its more likely to help organizations train new 
talent and prevent employee burnout. It could also simply reshuffle 
the deck of cybersecurity talent as it introduces new roles like 
prompt engineering.

Generative AI as the attackers ally
Security teams are also rightfully concerned that generative 
AI is yet another tool in the arsenals of adversaries. Forty\-five 
percent of respondents believe generative AI will be a net win for 
cyber attackers, and 77% say it expands the attack surface to a 
concerning degree.
Same attacks, different day
What unique threats will generative AI unleash upon the 
world? Odds are that instead of an immediate windfall of new 
attacks, generative AI will amplify threats already confronting 
security teams. 
Thirty\-two percent of respondents are most concerned about 
attackers using generative AI to optimize existing attacks, such as 
crafting more realistic phishing emails or refining malicious scripts. 
Less skilled, opportunistic hackers will exploit generative AI to 
drive a significant uplift in social engineering attacks. And 28% of 
respondents worry that generative AI will also help adversaries 
increase the volume of existing attacks. 
The enemy within
Not all AI threats originate from outside sources; 77% of 
respondents agree that more data leakage will accompany 
increased use of generative AI. However, only 49% are actively 
prioritizing data leakage prevention possibly because there 
arent many solutions yet that control the flow of data in and out 
of generative AI tools. 
Lack of education around generative AI only amplifies these 
concerns. When 65% of security executives admit they dont 
fully understand generative AI, its fair to assume confusion 
is even higher among non\-security roles. Without the proper 
education, end users are bound to make mistakes like putting 
sensitive company data into an LLM, which will place security 
teams in the crosshairs.

of generative AI
Where will generative AI go from here? No one has a crystal ball, but 
security teams have been embracing traditional forms of AI like machine 
learning (ML) for some time, and 93% say these experiences will influence 
their future approach to generative AI. 
Many organizations have gotten a taste of the increased productivity that 
ML tools provide, with 92% receiving substantial advantages already. The 
technology is not perfect, though, and needs special care: 73% say tools 
with traditional AI and ML capabilities can generate false positives, and 
91% say they require tuning. Similarly, generative AI calls for oversight to 
spot and prevent hallucinations that can undermine its value.
Those pioneers who have already built a solid foundation with traditional 
AI and machine learning will likely find themselves on the fast track of their 
generative AI journeys.

The building blocks of 
leading organizations
In the race to stay ahead of threats, some organizations follow a 
center of excellence model to build mature cybersecurity practices. 
In 2024, 47% of respondents identify their security programs as 
extremely advanced. Were classifying this group as leaders and will 
be comparing their unique characteristics and survey responses with 
those of the cohort who labeled their programs as developing.
State of Security 2024\|Splunk
15
For starters, leaders are confident in their ability to keep up with 
the threat landscape. Forty\-nine percent of leaders say managing 
cybersecurity requirements is getting easier, while only 29% of 
respondents with developing programs say the same. Leaders 
also outperform those with developing programs in several 
other aspects, painting a picture of what may be considered gold 
standard practices.
Resource and empower appropriately
Leading organizations arent born; they are made. Their winning 
approach reflects a deep connection to the board and business 
stakeholders, cross\-departmental collaboration and steady 
investments. Leading security teams have the budget to be 
proactive 67% are significantly increasing cybersecurity 
spending in the next one to two years, versus 28% of respondents 
with developing programs. 
A close connection to the business pays off for leading 
organizations, too. An impressive 95% say they have the resources 
and authority to address challenges, which mirrors the finding in our 
CISO Report that 47% of CISOs now report to the CEO.
Collaborate and recognize resilience
Being connected to the business isnt just about having the 
CEOs ear, it requires partnering across the business. Leading 
organizations collaborate more with these tech departments:

Collaboration also extends to compliance. Forty\-nine percent of 
leading organizations strongly agree that everyone on the security 
team makes compliance a part of their jobs, compared to just 27% 
of organizations with developing security programs.
Leading organizations recognize that theres a lot on the line when 
it comes to digital resilience. They more strongly agree that greater 
digital resilience leads to more innovation (41%), less business 
disruption (39%), and avoiding compliance penalties (39%) likely 
because theyre more closely connected to business outcomes.
Without executive buy\-in, achieving 
cybersecurity maturity is a losing battle. 
 Jason Lee, CISO, Splunk

State of Security 2024\|Splunk

Innovate more with generative AI
Leading organizations are also more likely to innovate with AI, with 
48% declaring it as a top initiative, compared to 30% of their less 
mature peers. Generative AI adoption among their security teams 
is higher and more widespread, too 75% of leaders say that most 
security team members were using generative AI, and only 23% of 
developing organizations say the same.
Generative AI usage among leading organizations appears to be 
less experimental and more methodical in contrast to developing 
organizations:
 82% of leaders have established generative AI security 
policies, while only 46% of developing organizations have 
done so. 
 55% of leaders have a formal plan to use generative AI for 
cybersecurity use cases, while only 15% of developing 
organizations make this claim.
Detect and respond to incidents faster
Cyber maturity doesnt translate to fewer cyberattacks. However, 
leading organizations detect and respond faster than their peers, 
which softens the blow of an attack and its consequences.
For incidents that caused disruption, leading organizations 
cite a mean time to detect (MTTD) of 21 days, while developing 
organizations, on average, spend over a month (34 days) detecting 
a threat within their networks. Leading organizations also spend 
far less time in recovery mode. Their average mean time to recover 
(MTTR) business\-critical workloads is just over 44 hours, while 
developing organizations average recovery time is 5\.7 days. 
The ability to reduce detection and response time speaks directly 
to the maturity of a security program. Thats why MTTR and MTTD 
are such crucial metrics for boards and executives. They want to 
see measurable success in the long term, says Mick Baccio, global 
security advisor at Splunks SURGe security research team.

Sizing up the threat 
landscape
While security teams fight the good fight, threat actors will still find 
ways to slip past even the best defenses. The State of Security 2024 
demonstrates that attackers arent slowing down, with data breaches 
and ransomware increasing 13% and 14% respectively since 2021\. 
State of Security 2024\|Splunk
19
In 2024, weve seen attackers use diverse tactics for example, 
business email compromise capitalizing on human deception, 
to DDoS attacks relying on brute force. Despite these varied 
approaches, these threats share an objective: cause disruption.
Cybersecurity incidents still have far\-reaching reputational, legal, 
and financial consequences, but organizations appear to be 
better at absorbing the blow even while enduring more attacks 
overall. For example, only 44% of respondents say that remediating 
incidents required significant time and personnel this year, down 
13% from last year. Also, fewer respondents lost productivity and 
suffered confidential data breaches this year, indicating that digital 
resilience initiatives are working.

Cyber anxieties dont always 
match realities
While million\-dollar ransom payments, CISO indictments and zero\-
days make great headlines, they are uncommon. When cybersecurity 
professionals are asked about threats they find most concerning versus 
those they are actually experiencing, their fears are sometimes misplaced.
For example, though respondents say AI\-powered attacks are their number 
one concern, they experience data breaches, business email compromise, 
system compromise, and identity\-based attacks far more often.
The opposite is also true the perceived threats pale in comparison to the 
actual attacks. Only 18% of respondents rank business email compromise 
(BEC) as their most concerning threat, even though it was number two on 
the list of most common incidents in 2024\.
However, some fears line up to reality. Data breaches, for instance, are both 
a top concern and the attack experienced most often, with 52% reporting 
at least one data breach incident in the past two years. 
Fear lies in the unknown. Organizations have processes 
and procedures to defend against well\-known attacks 
like data breaches, but they dont know what 
if anything will stop AI\-powered attacks yet.

Human beings are the common denominator 
How are bad actors getting in? Despite the rise in automation and 
generative AI, humans are still the weak link. Respondents name 
misconfigured systems as both the most common threat vector 
(38%) and the most concerning threat vector (35%).
This alignment between concern and experience suggests security 
teams know misconfiguration is a problem (kudos to monitoring!) 
but cannot manage it effectively. More complex systems and scarce 
security talent may exacerbate the issue and make eliminating 
misconfigurations altogether seem like a game of whac\-a\-mole.

Financially\-motivated 
attacks persist 
When it comes to data breaches, ransomware, and extortion 
the trio of financially motivated attacks the bogeyman is real. 
The number of respondents who had their data and systems 
held hostage rose from 35% in 2022 to 42% in 2024\. And cyber 
extortion, a ransomware tactic that involves stealing and 
threatening to release company data publicly, was more common 
than ransomware itself. Forty\-eight percent of respondents say 
they experienced cyber extortion, compared to 45% who were 
ransomware victims. 
The popularity of cyber extortion may be attributed to the success 
of 2021s Colonial Pipeline incident, and more recently, the MOVEit 
attacks in which the Russian\-based ransomware group Clop 
anticipated earnings of $75\-100 million from extortion. 
As organizations realize the importance of testing backups, 
cybercriminals may be moving away from encryption and toward 
data exfiltration and extortion techniques that involve less work, 
yield higher payouts, and dont rely on failed backups.
Geopolitics inflame
cyber woes 
2024 has been afflicted by global unrest. These rising geopolitical 
tensions have cyber implications that affect even seemingly 
apolitical organizations. A 2023 hacktivist attack on a Pennsylvania\-
based water treatment plant underscores that no one is completely 
safe from nation\-state adversaries and terrorist groups.
Eighty\-six percent of respondents say the current geopolitical 
climate is contributing to their organization being targeted more. 
Technology companies in particular agree strongly with this sentiment 
(42%) compared to 29% of respondents overall. High\-profile 
breaches with geopolitical ties like SolarWinds remind technology 
companies, particularly IT services providers, that they can be a 
bridge for politically motivated actors to reach a range of targets. 
Interestingly, only 17% of public sector respondents strongly 
agree that rising geopolitical tensions make them more of a target, 
perhaps because government organizations have been and likely 
always will be a target for geopolitical attacks. 
Hacktivism isnt always sophisticated, says Audra Streetman, 
security strategist at Splunk SURGe. Politically motivated attackers 
often use older vulnerabilities, default passwords, and other low\-
hanging fruit to target organizations, so a commitment to cyber 
hygiene is more important than ever.
Growing geopolitical tensions will continue 
to increase risks, even to organizations 
that are seemingly apolitical. A byproduct 
of our global supply chain is the inherited 
risk with every digital link.

The mounting pressure 
of compliance
For security professionals, regulatory compliance is up there with 
death and taxes: they can count on it. In fact, 62% say theyve 
already been impacted by changing compliance mandates that 
require disclosure of material breaches.
State of Security 2024\|Splunk
24
Security professionals are keenly aware that the regulatory 
environment will trigger changes to their work in intended and 
perhaps unintended ways. For example, 87% agree that one year 
from now they will handle compliance very differently. And while 
compliance and cybersecurity arent contradictory by any means, 
the unintended consequences could include sacrificing one 
program for another. Eighty\-six percent say theyll shift budgets to 
prioritize compliance regulations over security best practices. 
The responses echo our October 2023 CISO Report, in which 84% 
of CISO respondents were concerned about personal liability for 
cybersecurity incidents. In the same study, 84% of CISOs said their 
boards or governing bodies equated strong security with regulatory 
compliance and not with traditional security success metrics. 
Its not hard to see why. New rules in the U.S. require organizations 
regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to 
disclose and describe all material cybersecurity incidents, and 
to share information on their risk management programs annually. 
Failing to comply could result in steep financial penalties, legal 
prosecution, and even jail time for executives. In the European Union, 
the NIS2 Directive requires organizations to establish appropriate 
teams to respond to incidents and information systems to exchange 
information. Leaders can be held personally liable for infringements.
Security professionals are caught between a metaphorical rock 
and a hard place. Underestimate the damage, and they can face 
fraud allegations and possible jail time. Overestimate, and their 
assumptions can cause stock prices to nosedive and breed general 
distrust with the board. 
This poses somewhat of a moral quandary: Do you underreport a 
breach and hope it flies under the radar? Or overreport an incident 
to cover all your bases and yourself in the process, knowing 
your company share price might take a hit? 
Regulation is now an undeniable mainstay of security strategy. 
Simulation exercises such as tabletops can help companies 
uncover gaps, while also proving to regulators they are invested in 
continuous improvement before they become the next headline.

Security, legal, and compliance teams join forces
Once upon a time, compliance was largely a transactional function. 
Compliance teams operated in silos, often without communicating 
with or even fully understanding the role of the security teams, and 
vice versa. 
The dearth of regulations puts those days in the rearview as non\-
compliance carries more serious consequences. In October 2023, 
the SEC charged SolarWinds former CISO with fraud and internal 
control failures that led to the devastating 2020 cyberattack, 
alleging that he misled shareholders about the companys 
cybersecurity practices. Communication between the board, legal, 
compliance, and security teams is non\-negotiable, so learning to 
play nice together is a must. 
Organizations and their boards will have to think long and hard 
about who is most liable when not if a breach occurs. That 
likely means the CISO. But it also could include the CTO, CIO, or 
even the cyber expert on the board, who could be targeted for a 
derivative suit or suffer additional scrutiny.
These developments are not lost on security professionals, with 
the majority of respondents ramping up security practices and 
facilitating alignment among legal and compliance teams.
Getting everyone on the same page will pay dividends. Aligning 
priorities, roles, and responsibilities makes your security posture 
more effective, while empowering legal and compliance teams to 
become more self\-sufficient.

Compliance gets personal
The SolarWinds indictment was a watershed moment the first 
time the SEC ever charged a CISO in relation to a cybersecurity 
incident. This unprecedented action marked a turning point in how 
the world views cybersecurity, and it will have lasting implications 
for security leaders and their teams. Cyber risk is now unequivocally 
synonymous with business risk. 
The SEC is holding executives and other stakeholders accountable, 
and theyre not holding back. Along with a spate of new, fully\-
enforced global mandates, security teams must also report 
incidents more quickly. The E.U.s NIS2 allows 24 to 72 hours, while 
the SEC provides slightly more breathing room with up to four 
business days. Still, the window is shrinking a development that 
will likely be a call to arms for the most seasoned professionals.
More accountability for incidents may lead to better security 
practices, but it may also have a chilling effect on the profession. 
How many would be willing to go to jail for making a mistake on 
the job? 
The fear is probably overblown, but these outliers represent a 
real deterrent. At a time when cyber teams grapple with talent 
shortages, the fear of compliance penalties is one more reason to 
consider a different career.

In 2024, cybersecurity is guided by a medley of global dynamics, 
including new compliance requirements and geopolitical tensions, but 
there are also reasons to be hopeful. Being bold and bullish on AI will 
bode well for defenders especially if organizations can mitigate the 
risks and maintain control over how their employees use AI tools. 
Another reason for optimism moving forward is that businesses are 
investing more in cybersecurity. Nearly every organization surveyed 
(96%) says they will increase their spending on cybersecurity in the 
next one to two years.

A bit of parting advice
With so much change and evolving technology, it can be difficult 
for organizations to determine where to focus their efforts. Splunk 
experts shared their advice with this years data in mind.
Embrace generative AI throughout the business. 
Widespread adoption is already occurring across the business 
(93%) and within security teams (91%). Organizations that resist 
generative AI may get left behind. Attempting to ban it altogether 
will close the door to innovation while simultaneously opening one 
for shadow AI. 
Craft thoughtful generative AI policies without 
sacrificing innovation. 
Rushing to adopt generative AI without considering the risks and 
implications is a mistake. Create a policy around generative AI and 
develop a plan for business and security use cases to pull ahead of 
the 34% of organizations without a codified policy. Determine which 
generative AI risks are most concerning for 49% of respondents, 
its data leakage and build policies that address them specifically.
Emphasize collaboration among teams and 
consolidation among tools. 
Digitally resilient organizations are breaking down silos in software 
engineering, engineering operations, and most importantly, 
IT. Seventy\-six percent of leading organizations increased 
collaboration with IT operations this year to improve digital 
resilience. Another way to reduce friction is tool consolidation, 
which can prevent dashboard overload and help teams focus on 
meaningful threats. Forty\-three percent of respondents report 
that they pivot between too many disparate security tools and 
management consoles.
Get in lockstep with legal and compliance teams. 
This year ushers in a new era of compliance for security leaders, 
who should work closely with legal and compliance teams for 
maximum alignment. Ninety\-one percent say security teams already 
make compliance part of their jobs. Organizations can lean on 
simulation exercises such as tabletops to help uncover security and 
compliance gaps, while also proving to regulators they are invested 
in continuous improvement.
State of Security 2024\|Splunk
29
Learn how to effectively advocate for resources. 
Cybersecurity maturity comes from the top down 95% of 
leading organizations say they have the resources and authority to 
solve problems. CISOs in particular should be able to discuss and 
translate security risk from a business perspective to earn a seat 
at the table with executives. Communicate to the board in ways 
that highlight the business value of cybersecurity investments. This 
includes reporting the impact of cybersecurity incidents to the 
business, or articulating compliance requirements with severe legal 
or financial consequences. 
Think outside the box to close talent gaps. 
Data shows that leading organizations lean on less traditional hiring 
and training methods. Fifty\-three percent of leaders are using AI 
and machine learning to fill hiring gaps, compared to only 28% 
of developing organizations. These creative hiring and training 
strategies like programs that allow people in non\-security roles 
to shadow in the SOC can help close the skills gap and infuse 
much\-needed diversity into a security team. 
Dont forget the basics. 
While cybersecurity threats are becoming more sophisticated, 
adversaries still rely on tried\-and\-true techniques, and 
misconfigured systems remain a top vector in 2024\. Implementing 
basic controls is where organizations can get the greatest return 
on investment, making it easier to keep up with requirements in 
the long term. Although 76% say completing an IT asset inventory 
takes too much time, its time well spent. An up\-to\-date view of your 
assets and their dependencies can prevent dangerous blindspots.
Tune into global dynamics that affect the 
cybersecurity landscape. 
Cybersecurity doesnt exist in a vacuum. Politics, global conflict, 
and tightening compliance mandates have direct and indirect 
impacts on the threat landscape. Eighty\-six percent of respondents 
say that the current geopolitical climate makes them a bigger attack 
target, and 62% say theyve been impacted by changing compliance 
mandates. When organizations are aware of these changing 
dynamics, they can more readily navigate the associated obstacles.

Industry highlights
We identified key insights across six select industries worldwide.
Methodology 
Manufacturing
Manufacturers are more focused on cloud security than other industries, 
with 40% citing it as a top initiative. Zero\-day vulnerabilities are also top\-of\-
mind for manufacturers, with 39% naming them as a top concern possibly 
due to the inherent difficulty of patching critical infrastructure.
Respondents in the manufacturing sector are also struggling to keep up with 
the changing threat landscape: 
 51% of manufacturing security professionals report that security 
requirements have become harder over the last 12 months. 
 Manufacturing respondents are more likely to say that increases in 
threat sophistication are bogging them down (50% versus 38% across 
all industries).
These setbacks could indicate a lack of investment from the business, as 
manufacturers are much less likely (36%) to expect a significant rise in 
cybersecurity spending, versus 48% across industries.
However, manufacturing respondents appear to have an edge over other 
industries when it comes to hiring security talent:
 27% say that stress on the job made them or others consider leaving 
cybersecurity multiple times, well below the 36% across industries.
 27% say a critical project was delayed multiple times due to the skills 
gap, compared to 37% across industries.
Since manufacturing organizations struggle to secure additional 
cybersecurity budget, security executives should demonstrate the financial 
impact of incidents and focus on key risks to gain C\-suite and board level 
buy\-in.
Financial services
Compared to other industries, financial services respondents are more 
optimistic about their ability to keep up with cybersecurity requirements. 
Fifty percent say it was easier to keep up this year, versus 41% across 
industries. 
More collaboration across IT and engineering may be driving that optimism. 
Security teams at financial institutions say theyre apt to work more closely 
with engineering operations on digital resilience initiatives (64%, versus 46% 
across industries).
Financial services respondents are also more hopeful about generative AIs 
role in alleviating the talent gap. They agree that generative AI would help:
 Organizations source and onboard talent faster (63% versus 58% 
across industries)
 Enable seasoned security professionals to be more productive (71% 
versus 65% across industries) 
However, they also recognize the risk of generative AI. Seventy\-six percent of 
financial services respondents say they dont have enough education to fully 
understand the implications of generative AI, versus 65% across industries. 
Accordingly, 39% list AI\-powered attacks as a top concern.
Unsurprisingly, security professionals at financial services firms say that 
compliance has become such a large job that it necessitates a separate 
team (43% versus 39% across other industries). Cyber extortion is also more 
common at financial institutions (54% versus 48% across industries).
Researchers surveyed 1,650 security 
executives in December 2023 and January 
1\. Respondents were in Australia, 
France, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, 
Singapore, United Kingdom, and United 
States. They also represented 16 industries: 
Aerospace and defense, business services, 
consumer packaged goods, education, 
financial services, government (federal
national, state and local), healthcare, life 
sciences, manufacturing, technology, 
media, oilgas, retailwholesale, telecom, 
transportationlogistics, and utilities.

Communications and media
Communications and media respondents are most likely (57%) to identify their 
cybersecurity programs as extremely advanced (versus 47% across industries). 
Yet, this industry is also the most likely to say they didnt have the resources or 
authority to address challenges (16%, compared to 8% across industries). 
Communications and media stood out as the industry struggling most with 
the following: 
 82% say its difficult to keep up with security hygiene and posture 
management due to frequent changes and growth in the attack surface, 
compared to 71% across industries. 
 62% say their SOC pivots between too many disparate security tools and 
management consoles, compared to 43% across industries.
 47% say themselves or others have considered leaving cybersecurity 
multiple times due to the inability to hire or retain staff with the right skills, 
compared to 36% across industries.
 74% say they are impacted by changing compliance mandates, compared 
to 62% across industries.
These difficulties may have led to communications and media organizations 
encountering several types of incidents with increased frequency, including 
insider attacks (55% versus 42% across industries), digital asset fraud (59% 
versus 43% across industries), software supply chain attacks (57% versus 43% 
across industries), and targeted attacks (54% versus 44% across industries) than 
industry counterparts. Misconfigured systems are more problematic for the 
communications and media sector, with 44% of industry respondents citing it as 
a root cause in the past two years.
Communications and media organizations should focus on achieving executive 
buy\-in to boost the maturity of their cybersecurity programs even further. When 
cybersecurity teams have the resources and authority to solve problems, theyll 
likely see better outcomes around threat prevention. 
Technology
Respondents from technology companies indicated that they struggle with 
complex environments. As a result:
 Tech companies are more likely to cite security stack complexity 
as a reason why they find it difficult to keep up with cybersecurity 
requirements (36% of tech companies, versus 26% across industries).
 Tech companies are more apt to say they have too many fragmented 
security tools and a lack of human resources to accomplish manual work 
(37% of tech companies, versus 26% across industries). 
 Known software vulnerabilities (34%) and vulnerabilities in internal 
applications (34%) are more frequently the root cause of incidents in the 
technology sector. 
The changing regulatory environment is another barrier 41% of respondents 
from tech companies say this contributes to their difficulties with keeping up, 
compared to 28% across industries.
Geopolitical conflict also affects technology companies more acutely. 
They strongly agree (42%) that international conflicts were contributing to 
their organization being targeted more by adversaries, compared to 29% 
across industries.
On a positive note, technology companies are much more likely (63%) to 
report a significant rise in anticipated security spending, compared to 48% 
across industries. 
For tech organizations struggling with complexity, the name of the game should 
be simplification. Tool consolidation could be an important initiative for this 
sector, which appears to suffer from shiny object syndrome.

Healthcare 
Healthcare organizations have the most problematic MTTDs out of any 
industry, with 31% stating they measure MTTD in months versus only 19% of 
organizations across all industries. They also deal with ransomware attacks 
more than other industries, with 56% reporting a ransomware attack in the past 
two years, compared to 45% in aggregate. The healthcare sector is also more 
likely than other industries to cite overly permissive accounts (33%) as the most 
frequent root cause of incidents.
Healthcare respondents report greater hiring\-related issues than 
other industries: 
 44% say team members have been asked to lead projects without requisite 
experience, compared to 39% across industries.
 44% say a critical projects or initiatives have been delayed because of 
hiring problems, compared to 37% across industries. 
Most healthcare respondents say they have been impacted by changing 
compliance mandates (67%). They are also more likely to strongly agree 44%, 
the highest of any industry that these changes are causing more senior\-level 
individuals to be on call 247, compared to 35% across industries. 
Respondents in healthcare are the least optimistic about generative AI. Fifty\-
two percent say they expect adversaries to benefit from it more, compared to 
45% across industries. Theyre also less interested in using AI to combat that 
competitive edge they expect adversaries to gain only 37% of healthcare 
organizations list AI as a priority, compared to 44% across industries. 
Considering the healthcare sectors hurdles with threat detection, ransomware 
prevention, and hiring, going back to the basics of cybersecurity hygiene could 
be a successful path forward that enables these organizations to do more 
with less.
Public Sector
Data from the public sector highlights a quest for knowledge. Public sector 
respondents place more focus on security awareness training (24%, compared 
to 17% across industries). Accordingly, they list their top challenge as a lack of 
cybersecurity knowledge and commitment from executives (28%, compared to 
20% across industries).
While last years public sector respondents were hesitant about traditional 
AIs ability to lighten the security teams load, this year the public sector show 
optimism for generative AI:
 Respondents from the public sector are most likely to see opportunities 
for generative AI to have a game\-changing impact to the business (55% 
versus 47% across industries) and anticipate the most benefit to the 
security team (55% versus 46% across industries).
 Security teams in the public sector are leading for adopting acceptable 
use policies for AI (77% versus 66% across industries).
 Public sector respondents are also more likely to envision security use 
cases for generative AI, including threat detection (46%, versus 35% 
across industries), penetration testing (42% versus 29% across industries), 
and security team training (44% versus 34% across industries).
Public sector organizations also appear to have greater SecOps automation 
aspirations than their peers, including automating SSL certificate management 
(43% versus 31% across industries), the orchestration of actions across security 
controls (53% versus 38%), and alert enrichment (47% versus 32%).
For cybersecurity basics, the public sector more frequently cites 
misconfigurations as the top vector for threats, with 42% saying they are most 
often the root cause. Public sector respondents are also most likely to be 
concerned about lateral movement, with 39% listing it as their primary concern.
Lack of knowledge and excitement for AI can be a dangerous combination, so 
public sector organizations should take a measured approach to AI adoption 
and educate themselves on the risks before jumping on the generative AI 
bandwagon.

Country highlights
Snapshots from across eight countries across the globe.
Australia 
Data from Australian organizations paints a harrowing picture of the countrys 
cybersecurity landscape. Organizations in Australia are more likely to strongly 
agree that geopolitical stress exacerbates cyberattacks (44%, compared to 
29% globally). Fifty\-six percent of Australian respondents experienced nation\-
state attacks compared to 39% globally. 
In fact, Australian respondents experience a higher\-than\-average rate of 
every attack type we asked about, including but not limited to data breaches 
(63%, versus 52% globally); regulatory compliance violations (53% versus 
43% globally); insider attacks (55% versus 42% globally) and business email 
compromise (59% versus 49% globally).
Perhaps the higher frequency of cyberattacks can be attributed to Australian 
respondents visibility\-related issues. Seventy\-two percent say they pivot too 
much between disparate security tools (compared to 43% globally), and 35% 
cite issues with visibility across the attack surface (compared to 20% globally). 
Its no surprise then that Australia also cites problematic detection, with 50% 
saying typical MTTD takes months compared to 19% globally.
Respondents in Australia also deal with staffing\-related challenges more than 
other countries: 
 52% say team members were asked to lead projects multiple times 
without requisite experience, compared to 39% globally.
 50% say stress on the job has made themselves or others consider leaving 
cybersecurity multiple times, compared to 36% globally.
 52% say critical security projects or initiatives have been delayed multiple 
times, compared to 37% globally.
Australia is a leader in both generative AI adoption and policy creation, with 
69% reporting that employees use public generative AI tools to do their jobs 
compared to 54% globally, and 73% reporting they had established security 
policies for generative AI use, compared to 66% globally.
France
Respondents in France are more apt to say that theyve struggled to keep up 
with cybersecurity requirements within the past year (56%, compared to 46% 
globally). Unsurprisingly, they also appear to have lower cybersecurity maturity, 
with only 37% describing their programs as extremely advanced compared to 
47% globally.
When asked why cybersecurity requirements are harder to keep up with, 33% 
of respondents in France report the number of tools and vendors within their 
security stacks have become too excessive, compared to 26% globally. A 
complicated tech stack often results in misconfigurations, and 40% of French 
respondents cite this as a concern. 
France trails behind other countries for extensively adopting cybersecurity tools 
with AI and machine learning capabilities (27%, compared to 37% globally). And 
while organizations in France are more apt to say they are focused on AI 56% 
in France, versus 44% globally they are also less likely to have established 
security policies for generative AI usage at 52%, compared to 66% globally. 
On the bright side, French respondents say theyve experienced fewer incidents 
than the global average across the following attack types in the past two years:
 44% experienced a data breach
 37% violated regulatory compliance
 37% experienced a DDoS attack
 40% were victims of a ransomware attack
State of Security 2024\|Splunk
35
Germany
Data from German respondents indicates a more acute awareness of generative 
AIs risks compared to their peers: 
 41% of German respondents strongly agree that generative AI expands 
their attack surface to a concerning degree, compared to 31% globally.
 38% of German respondents strongly agree that generative AI makes their 
existing attack surface more vulnerable, compared to 29% globally.
Organizations in Germany appear to have a hard time with staffing in particular. 
Thirty\-three percent cite an inability to hire enough skilled security staff as the 
reason why cybersecurity requirements were harder to keep up with in the past 
year, compared to 25% globally. 
In the SOC, 53% of German respondents say there is too much pivoting between 
disparate security tools (compared to 43% globally). Perhaps many of these 
disparate tools are cloud\-based, because Germany cites attacks on cloud 
infrastructure as one of the most concerning types of incidents (23%).
These hiring and tooling constraints may have contributed to slightly longer 
MTTDs than their peers; 40% of German respondents measure their MTTD in 
weeks, compared to 35% globally.
Despite these setbacks, Germany stands out from other countries in its ability to 
salvage data and systems during a ransomware attack. Fifty\-eight percent have 
been successful with this over the past two years the highest percentage of 
any country we surveyed compared to 44% globally. 
Respondents in Germany are also more likely to agree (94%) that todays 
geopolitical climate is contributing to being targeted more by adversaries, 
compared to 86% globally. 
India
Compared to other countries, India has the highest percentage of organizations 
(66%) that rate their security programs as extremely advanced, compared 
to 47% globally. They also have higher rates of increased collaboration across 
internal teams 58% with software engineering, 52% with engineering 
operations, and 78% with IT. 
Respondents in India are also particularly focused on cloud security, with 48% 
citing it as a top initiative compared to 35% globally. Unsurprisingly, India is 
the most likely to cite attacks on cloud\-based infrastructure as a top concern 
(25%) compared to other countries. Most top of mind for India, however, is cyber 
extortion, with 37% saying it was a top concern compared to 24% globally.
Compliance mandates requiring the disclosure of material breaches appear to 
heavily impact India, with 81% of Indian respondents reporting theyve been 
impacted by these changes, compared to 62% globally. Accordingly, 54% of 
Indian respondents strongly believe that everyone on the security team should 
make compliance a part of their jobs, compared to 42% globally.
Respondents in India are the most optimistic about how generative AI will tip the 
scales 51% expect defenders to gain a bigger advantage, versus 43% globally. 
They also recognize potential use cases of generative AI more often, including:
 Threat detection and prioritization (52% versus 35% globally)
 Training use cases (50% versus 34% globally)
 Threat intelligence analysis (55% versus 39% globally)
 Creating detection rules (44% versus 30% globally)
 Summarizing security data (54% versus 34% globally) 
Similarly, respondents in India appear to be ahead of the curve in establishing 
generative AI policies. Eighty\-two percent have established generative AI 
security policies for end users, compared to 66% globally.

Japan
Compared to their peers, Japanese respondents are more likely to say that 
cybersecurity requirements are getting harder to keep up with (54% versus 
46% globally). Only 27% of Japanese respondents say security is getting easier, 
compared to 41% globally. Out of those respondents, only 5% say that it is 
getting much easier, compared to the global 17% average.
Why are Japanese organizations having trouble keeping up? They cite the 
following pitfalls more than their peers:
 36% say their security stacks have become too convoluted,
compared to 26% globally.
 29% are unable to effectively analyze all security\-relevant data,
compared to 21% globally.
 27% have limited visibility into their attack surface, compared
to 20% globally.
Another possibility could be a lack of budget. Japan is less likely (38%) to report 
a significant rise in anticipated cybersecurity spending. 
Japanese respondents are less optimistic about the benefits of generative AI to 
SOC practitioners, with only 37% strongly agreeing that it would help develop 
their skills compared to 43% globally.
Out of the countries surveyed, Japan is most focused on ransomware 
protection, with 21% calling it a top initiative. That enhanced focus could 
possibly be paying off in the form of faster MTTD 43% of respondents in 
Japan report an MTTD measured in days, compared to the 33% global average.
Singapore
Data from Singaporean respondents indicates that their organizations 
cybersecurity programs are less mature than other countries. 
 Singapore has the highest percentage of respondents who identified their 
cybersecurity programs as developing (14%, compared to 7% globally). 
 They are less likely to say they have the authority and resources to address 
cybersecurity challenges (only 77%, compared to 91% in aggregate).
 They are the least likely (28%) to report a significant rise in anticipated 
cybersecurity spending.
 26% of Singaporean respondents do not know their average MTTR, and 
25% did not conduct post\-incident analyses to calculate MTTD.
As such, Singapore respondents are less likely to recognize the business impact 
of digital resilience. Only 23% strongly agree that digital resilience could improve 
customer retention, compared to 33% globally. Twenty\-five percent strongly 
agree that digital resilience could prevent significant disruptions to operations, 
compared to 35% globally. 
Organizations from Singapore appear to focus less on collaboration among 
compliance, security, and legal teams. Only 29% strongly agree with ramping up 
their compliance teams security training, compared to 42% globally. Only 29% 
strongly agree with the concept of incorporating compliance into the security 
teams workflow, compared to 42% globally. 
Our data indicates a correlation between program maturity and AI prioritization, 
so its not surprising that only 36% of Singapore respondents are focused on 
AI initiatives, compared to 44% globally. They are also less likely (48%) to have 
established generative AI policies. Compared to other countries, Singapore is 
also the least worried about AI\-powered attacks, with only 23% citing it as a 
top concern.

United Kingdom
Data from the United Kingdom paints a generally positive picture compared to 
their global counterparts.
UK organizations are increasing collaboration to achieve resilience more often: 
 66% say their security and software development teams are collaborating 
more (versus 54% globally). 
 56% say their security and engineering operations teams are collaborating 
more (versus 46% globally).
UK respondents are also ahead of other countries in terms of their automation 
capabilities. In particular, they have high rates of automation in regards to 
general process automation (40%) and vulnerability management (35%).
Skills shortages do not affect UK organizations as much as other countries. 
Thirty percent of UK respondents say that team members have been asked to 
lead projects multiple times without requisite experience, compared to 39% 
globally. Only 23% say critical security projects have failed multiple times due to 
skills shortages, compared to 33% globally. 
These successes may be why UK organizations experience lower\-than\-average 
rates of the following attack types compared to their peers: 
 Regulatory violations (35% versus 43% globally)
 Insider attacks (37% versus 42% globally) 
 Business email compromise (38% versus 49% globally) 
 DDoS attack (38% versus 46% globally) 
 Account takeover attack (34% versus 42% globally) 
 Ransomware attack (37% versus 45% globally) 
 Software supply chain attack (35% versus 43% globally)
United States
Data from U.S. respondents rarely deviates from the global averages. However, 
one area where U.S. respondents are ahead of the mean is the generative 
AI usage policy 72% have established one, compared to 66% globally. 
Conversely, U.S. respondents are the least concerned group to cite AI misuse as 
a root cause at only 18%.
U.S. respondents also struggle with longer MTTDs. Forty percent measure 
their MTTDs in weeks compared to 35% globally, and 22% say a typical MTTD 
is months compared to 19% globally. But this appears to be a work in progress, 
as 30% mention they improved MTTD with process automation, compared to 
25% globally.
For future priorities, U.S. respondents are slightly more inclined to address the 
cybersecurity talent shortage. Twenty\-one percent say they want to hire more 
security operations personnel (compared to 18% globally) and 25% plan to 
provide security operations training (compared to 23% globally).
