# Part I

## Challenges, Priorities, and Approaches to Work

### Under Pressure and Overcoming Obstacles

Understanding journalists’ biggest challenges is the first step to building strong media relationships. When you know the obstacles they face, you can tailor your interactions to be more meaningful and your pitches to resonate more effectively.

For tech journalists, “maintaining credibility as a trusted news source/combating accusations of ‘fake news’” emerged as the biggest industry challenge, with “adopting to changing audience perceptions around media consumption” close behind.

#### Why It Matters

PR professionals and tech journalists have a shared interest in maintaining the credibility of their audiences, whose habits for consuming news are always evolving. These concerns about trust, fake news, and misinformation underlines how important it is for PR to be extra diligent in ensuring they can back up their stories with objective facts, verified data, and credible sources.

#### What do you believe were the biggest challenges for the journalism industry in the last year?

- 43% Maintaining credibility as a trusted news source/combating accusations of “fake news”
- 41% Adapting to changing audience behaviors around media consumption
- 36% Declining advertising and circulation revenues
- 35% Lack of staffing and resources
- 28% The emergence of artificial intelligence
- 24% Competing with social media influencers and digital content creators for audience attention
- 24% Blurring lines between editorial and advertising
- 23% Verifying information and finding credible sources
- 14% Attacks on freedom of the press

### Examining Journalism’s Social Status

Social media is ubiquitous for tech journalists, with only 2% indicating they don’t use it for work-related purposes. The vast majority say they use it to promote content, source information, and/or interact with their audiences.

As for where their outlets intend to increase their social media activity, LinkedIn is the clear winner ahead of Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.

#### In the last year, have you used social media for any of the following work-related reasons?

- 76% To publish/promote content
- 71% To source information
- 65% To interact with my audience
- 62% To monitor (news, keywords, competitive media, etc.)
- 59% To network
- 55% To pick up on trending topics
- 53% To check or verify information
- 52% To connect with experts or interview subjects
- 2% N/A - I don’t use social media for work-related purposes

#### Over the next year, which social media platforms does your brand/media outlet plan to be more active on?

- 51% LinkedIn
- 39% Instagram
- 35% Facebook
- 33% YouTube
- 28% X (formerly Twitter)
- 21% TikTok
- 14% WhatsApp
- 11% Threads

#### Why It Matters

PR professionals should note the many ways in which tech journalists use social media and consider how they can offer the same value: by connecting them to experts or interview subjects, presenting story ideas around trending topics, and ensuring information is verified. They should also consider the social platforms their brands dedicate the most time to, and ensure their story ideas would play well on those feeds.

### AI in the Newsroom

Even though tech journalists cited AI’s emergence as one of the industry’s biggest challenges, 50% of them are using it in their work in some form.

More than a quarter of those journalists use it for research purposes, while 12% say they use it in the creation of multimedia, which makes sense, given how tech stories often benefit from visual aids. That indicates tech journalists could be further along in their AI experimentation than those covering other sectors.

#### Are you using generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Bard (now Gemini) in your work?

- 49% Not at all
- 31% A little
- 12% A moderate amount
- 7% Often

#### In what capacity have you used generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard (now Gemini) in your work?

- 26% To research certain topics
- 20% To help create outlines or early drafts of content
- 14% To brainstorm new story ideas
- 13% To brainstorm interview questions
- 12% To create multimedia (video, images, etc.)
- 5% To learn more about my audiences

#### Why It Matters

With tech journalists nearing a 50/50 split in generative AI usage, PR professionals should note how the early adopters are leveraging it. Knowing that journalists are looking for assistance brainstorming story ideas, researching topics, or creating multimedia, for example, PR professionals can give themselves an advantage by proactively providing these assets themselves.

## What Tech Journalists Wish PR Professionals Knew

### The Content Journalists Want

What do tech journalists want from PR professionals? The press release still holds immense value for more than three quarters. Original research (e.g. trends, market data, reports) is also high on the list (cited by 68%).

One thing that stood out with tech journalists: experts. Fifty-two percent said they were looking to get interviews with industry experts, while 56% named them as useful for generating content ideas.

#### What kind of content do you most want to receive from public relations professionals?

- 77% News announcements/press releases
- 68% Original research reports (trends, market data, etc.)
- 55% Exclusives for stories
- 52% Interviews with industry experts
- 45% Access to events
- 29% Multimedia (videos, images, infographics, etc.)
- 29% Products/samples to test

#### Which sources do you find most useful for generating content or ideas?

- 72% Press releases
- 56% Industry experts
- 52% Direct pitches
- 39% Company news/press room
- 36% News agencies (AP, Reuters, AFP, etc.)
- 34% Brand/company spokesperson
- 31% Press release distribution services
- 26% Company social media channels

#### Why It Matters

As these findings show, there are myriad ways to bring attention to your brand’s story, leveraging content and sources that tech journalists will respond to. Consider how you can combine these sources to add more power to your media outreach – and think about prioritizing experts or brand spokespeople. Tech journalists value hearing from people who are considered authorities in their industry.

### Multimedia Matters

Tech-focused stories often benefit from visual aids, and these findings underscore the value tech journalists place on such elements. In fact, as these findings also show, the right multimedia can be a deciding factor in whether they cover your story. Images and data visualizations/infographics will win the most favor.

#### Which multimedia elements – provided by a PR professional – have you used in your content over the past year?

- 76% Images
- 44% Data visualizations/infographics
- 35% Videos
- 35% Web polls/surveys
- 22% Social media posts
- 18% Brand logos
- 11% None of the above
- 10% Livestreams
- 9% Audio
- 6% Interactives (dashboards, games, etc.)
- 6% Animation
- 3% Quizzes

#### Why It Matters

While including multimedia in your pitch is not a surefire way to get coverage, it clearly has sway – but it must make sense for the journalist’s medium.

#### Are you more likely to pursue a pitch if it includes multimedia elements?

- 43% No, it makes no difference
- 39% It depends on the type of multimedia
- 17% Yes

### Achieving the Right Pitch

More than 60% of tech journalists receive more than 50 pitches per week; yet only a fraction of those pitches has any relevance to them. Most journalists prefer email outreach, with 68% saying they prefer just one follow-up after the initial pitch.

#### On average, how many pitches do you receive a week (including emails, phone calls, social media messages, etc.)?

- 11% 1 - 50
- 22% 51 - 100
- 37% 101 - 150
- 6% 151 +
- 26% (This percentage is not explicitly tied to a range in the provided text, but likely represents a category not fully detailed.)

#### How many times should a PR professional follow up with you after a pitch?

- 68% Once
- 28% Never
- 6% Multiple times

#### How do you prefer to receive pitches?*

- 91% email
- 9% WhatsApp message
- 3% Phone call
- 2% Social media/DM
- 2% WeChat message
- 1% Other

*Additional answer options were given in China.

#### What percentage of pitches received do you consider relevant?

- 1% 0% - 25% of pitches
- 6% 26% - 50% of pitches
- 20% 51% - 75% of pitches
- 72% 76% - 100% of pitches

#### Why It Matters

Tech journalists are flooded with irrelevant pitches, so if you want your pitch to stand out, do your research beforehand to ensure it’s right for the journalist and their audience.

(Pro tip: A comprehensive media database can help you identify the right tech journalists to reach out to for your pitch, along with data to understand the right follow up approach.)

### How to Gain Favor with Tech Journalists

It makes sense that “understand my audience and what they find relevant” is the number one way PR professionals can make tech journalists’ lives easier, given earlier findings that they are inundated with irrelevant pitches. It also makes sense that, based on their feedback on the content they want, getting connected with industry experts holds the second spot.

#### What can PR professionals do to make your job easier?

- 69% Understand my target audience and what they find relevant
- 55% Connect me with experts/spokespeople and set up interviews
- 52% Provide data and key research
- 52% Respect my deadlines (respond quickly to inquiries, provide information in a timely manner, etc.)
- 48% Provide new and relevant story ideas
- 35% Take time to personalize their outreach
- 34% Provide short pitches with facts that enable me to produce short-form content quickly
- 27% Include multimedia assets with their pitches and press releases
- 24% Provide relevant quotes from executives or industry experts

### How to Lose Favor with Tech Journalists

In addition to revealing what they want from PR professionals and the actions they appreciate, tech journalists also shed light on the behaviors they won’t tolerate. Given their overflowing inboxes, it follows that getting “spammed” with irrelevant pitches is first on the list.

#### What would make you block a PR professional or put them on your “don’t call” list?

- 76% Spamming me with irrelevant pitches
- 65% Providing inaccurate or unsourced information
- 55% Pitches that sound like marketing brochures
- 47% Following up with me repeatedly
- 47% Dodging inquiries/lack of transparency
- 28% Canceling on me last minute
- 26% Failing to respond to me same day/within deadline
- 19% Contacting me on social media when we have never met
- 19% Attaching files to emails (instead of embedding links)
- 17% Addressing me by the wrong name

#### Why It Matters

The easier PR teams make it for tech journalists to cover their stories, the more likely they are to do so. And the easier you are to work with, the more likely journalists will want to work with you again (and again), so take note of the many ways you can be of assistance. At the same time, be aware of ways in which you may be unintentionally getting in your own way, like sending over too many pitches or not sourcing information correctly.

# Part III

## Tech Journalists: What Sets Them Apart?

### Tech Journalists Vs. the Industry at Large

For this report, we sought to understand the challenges journalists in the technology and engineering sector are facing to help industry-adjacent media relations professionals gain not just their attention, but their trust and partnership as well.

For additional context, we compared these insights to the Global State of the Media Report, which included journalists across all major industry sectors. Here is a summary of key findings.

#### Tech Journalists Have Mixed Feelings on AI

The explosion of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini (previously Bard) has left many in the media grappling with its implications and possible dangers. More than a quarter of tech journalists see the emergence of AI as a challenge to the industry, but 50% said they are using it in some way – from researching topics to creating outlines or early drafts on content. Of those, 12% said they were using AI to create multimedia – that’s four percentage points higher than the rest of the industry, indicating that tech journalists are further along in their AI journey than others.

#### Tech Journalism is Embracing LinkedIn

The number one social media platform tech journalists say their brands plan to have a greater presence on in the coming year is LinkedIn (ahead of Instagram and Facebook). This is a notable difference from the global responses to this year’s State of the Media, where Instagram is the top social platform overall. Additionally, 62% of tech journalists said they used social to monitor for news, keywords, and competitive media, which is eight percentage points higher when compared to journalists across all industries.

#### Content Is King

Press releases and original research and data are among the types of content tech journalists look for the most from PR professionals. However, multimedia is also a key factor in creating content, and more than three-quarters said they used PR-supplied images in their work in the last year. Forty-four percent said they used data visualizations or infographics, a full 10 percentage points more than the global results.

#### Tech Journalists Place Extra Value on Experts

Fifty-six percent of respondents named industry experts as useful for generating content ideas (nine percentage points higher than the rest of the industry), while more than half said they were looking for interviews with them from PRs. Both figures trend higher than the overall global figures, suggesting that journalists in the tech industry place a greater emphasis on experts to add credibility and authority to their work.

## Survey Methodology

This report is a sub-section of Cision’s 2024 Global State of the Media Report, based on responses from 543 journalists and media influencers who cover the topics of technology and engineering.

Cision conducted its 2024 State of the Media survey in January and February of 2024. Surveys were emailed to Cision Media Database members, who are vetted by the company’s media research team to verify their positions as media professionals, influencers, and bloggers, and to the members of our Connectively community. We also made the survey available to media professionals in the PR Newswire for Journalists database.

This year’s survey collected responses from 3,016 respondents in 19 markets across the globe: U.S., Canada, UK, France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

For select questions throughout this report, respondents were permitted to choose more than one answer, resulting in percentages exceeding 100%. A portion of the questions asked in the survey were also optional, so some questions may have been skipped by participants, resulting in percentages less than 100%.
