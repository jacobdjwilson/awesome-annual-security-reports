## Introduction
The Journey from Reactive to
Predictive Security Operations

The time for reactive security has passed. It can’t effectively address
sophisticated cyberthreats, evolving threat vectors, and complex
technology requirements. Threat actors constantly fine-tune their
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), outpacing reactive security
programs and increasing risk.

Over-reliance on frameworks leans into reactivity. Checking 50 or
100 boxes leads some decision makers to believe their organizations
are protected. But frameworks aren’t lightweight, adaptable, risk-aware,
or business-enabled, unlike predictive security operations. Frameworks
are essential, but forward-looking decision makers see the urgency
in anticipating, preventing, and neutralizing cyber risks before they
impact the business.

New thinking prioritizes the move from reactive to predictive
cybersecurity. The journey requires the right technology foundation,
unified security operations, and an integrated security ecosystem
that leverages artificial intelligence (AI). This eBook explores security
operations center as a service (SOCaaS) and the role it plays in the
future of cybersecurity.

## Chapter 1
From Standalone Tools to
Integrated Ecosystem

Remember the early days? Everything felt fragmented.

Tools operated in isolation. Managed detection and response
(MDR) identified threats, and endpoint detection and response
(EDR) monitored endpoints. Data silos flourished because
the tools weren’t integrated. Practitioners perfected their
techniques for swiveling screen to screen and populating
spreadsheets. Teams scrambled to connect the dots and
decide what actions to take.

MDR and EDR went on, along with vulnerability management
service (VMS) and managed gateway service (MGS), to form
the technology foundation that enables modern SOCs. Many
organizations tried to call this concept a “fusion center.” However,
the real evolution of standalone tools into an integrated security
ecosystem is the backstory of the synchronized detection
and response engine known as SOCaaS.

With businesses
increasingly emphasizing
proactive cybersecurity
measures, the demand
for AI-driven SOC is
expected to rise, further
contributing to the SOC as
a Service market growth.1

## Chapter 1

The broad ecosystem includes the frameworks that provide necessary security standards
and guidance. SOCaaS aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001/27002,
SOC Type 2, PCI DSS, and others. In fact, the automation and orchestration built into
SOCaaS make it easier and less time-consuming to maintain compliance.

SOCaaS aligns with the top industry frameworks,
including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

## Chapter 2
Integration Turns Data
into Intelligence

SOCaaS integrates and centers MDR, EDR, VMS, and other services in ways
that enhance the quality of security work, reduce the risk of technology
depreciation, and align with cybersecurity insurance requirements. Think
of SOCaaS as a single source of truth that helps to close cybersecurity
OODA loops.

Integration turns data into the intelligence that supports predictive security
operations. Every tool spews out data that feeds threat hunting, forensic
investigations, verification of control failures, and other activities. When the
tools talk to each other and/or to the SOC, humans and AI engines collaborate
to produce intelligence that ideally considers your industry, organizational
type and size, current controls, and risk tolerance. So armed, you can more
quickly prioritize what to do—quarantine, evict, apply compensating controls,
counterattack, or take another action.

Actionable intelligence elevates security programs:

*   Predict threats before they materialize.
*   Become threat-hunting experts.
*   Demonstrate the value of security investments through visibility and metrics.

Modern MDR
Technologies are evolving
faster than ever, raising
questions about CapEx
versus OpEx. The history
of MDR demonstrates a
steady progression.

## Chapter 3
Predictive Defense
Anticipates and
Neutralizes Threats

The integration and orchestration within SOCaaS enable predictive defense.
Certain SOCaaS capabilities help to shut down cyberthreats before they cause harm:

24/7 expert monitoring and analysis
SOCaaS forms the backbone of an intelligent security
ecosystem that goes far beyond monitoring. It raises the
bar with a product-agnostic approach and experts capable
of closing in on error-free services.

Integrated threat intelligence
Integration, which brings automation and repeatability to
threat hunting, enables breadcrumb trails. A well-integrated
SOCaaS enables precise threat hunting across technology
platforms; in multi-tenant, cloud, and on-premises
environments; and within industries in which particular
threat actors specialize.

Unified security operations
A unified, comprehensive view simplifies security
management. With less complexity, practitioners can
collaborate more easily and act sooner.

Coordinated response capabilities.
Coordination leads to timely, efficient detection, analysis,
prioritization, and response. Coordinated capabilities may
include incident management, real-time sharing of threat
intelligence, automated responses, and reviews to identify
lessons learned.

SOCaaS is more than
a security program
upgrade. It’s a
fundamental change in
how you think about and
deploy cybersecurity
defense. An AI-powered
ecosystem comes
with eyes and ears
that never sleep.

## Chapter 4
Old Versus New
Cybersecurity Thinking

Certain cybersecurity challenges persist—lack of visibility, resource
constraints, operational inefficiencies, and emerging threats.
They likely will intensify. How will your security program cope?

Old thinking anchors you in reactionary mode. You keep doing what
you’re doing. Perhaps this means throwing more tools at the problem.
Or taking the path of least resistance, which might be the status quo
or trusting in “wait and see.” Or feeling overwhelmed every day.

Old thinking increases vulnerabilities and risk because the threat
actors, technologies and processes continue to change.

New thinking centers on AI-driven intelligence derived from normalized
data located in one place. Centralized data allows automation and
orchestration to streamline every aspect of SecOps. New thinkers
ponder questions such as:

*   How do we adapt traditional technology buying cycles and
depreciation schedules to the current pace of cybersecurity?
*   How can we connect our tools intelligently?
*   What is the ideal way to transform data into foresight and alerts
into action?
*   How do we reduce the noise when an attack is real?
*   What changes to our security program will demonstrate that it’s
a strategic asset and not a cost center?

Tips to Advance
New Thinking

*   Share knowledge about
software development
that supports
integration.
*   Talk about strategies
for modernizing your
tech stack.
*   Evaluate and buy
only tools that have
built-in APIs.
*   Discuss the wildly
different motions
required in cloud
and on-premises
environments.

## Chapter 4

Cybersecurity Trends to Watch

*   Use of AI, machine learning (ML), and generative AI (GenAI) to close the
    cyberskills gap and to augment detection, response, and prediction
*   Security of IoT devices
*   Evolution of TTPs
*   Increase in cyberattacks, particularly ransomware and phishing
*   Greater adoption of cybersecurity insurance—the policies typically
    require 24/7 SOC coverage
*   Reliance on metrics to help prove the value of cybersecurity investments
*   The geopolitical landscape (global conflict, trade)
*   Big-tech and societal trends

## Chapter 5
On the Road to
Predictive Security

Security programs pass through maturity stages: technology-
centric, compliance-driven, threat-aware, and risk-based.
Ideally, programs mature to the point where security discussions
are primarily about the business and risk, not technology.

Risk-based security operations are grounded by AI-driven
predictive intelligence, which speeds up inferences, connections,
and decisions.

Maturing your security program won’t happen overnight, but
adding risk assessment to any stage will expedite your journey.
Generally, risk-based discussions span topics such as:

*   Who you are as a business
*   How you generate revenue
*   What’s at risk, whether assets, reputation, revenue, etc.
*   Who are the bad actors and how they operate
*   What controls are in place to stop a threat
*   What controls need to be put into place to stop a threat
and/or reduce risk

Decisions about individual threat situations call for specificity and
precision. A risk equation facilitates risk calculation without straying into
technical minutiae. The equation identifies the assets to be protected
along with the threat, the vulnerability, and the countermeasure(s).
For example, X threat at X time is using X technique for X purpose, and
recommendations include X controls and/or process changes.

Security Program
Maturity Stages

*   Technical/
    infrastructure-centric.
    Problems are solved
    mainly with technology.
*   Compliance-driven.
    Regulations drive
    security decisions.
*   Threat-aware. Gaps
    in security controls
    and/or industry-standard
    frameworks trigger
    actions.
*   Risk-based. Predictive
    intelligence drives
    priorities that are aligned
    with business needs
    and risk tolerance.

## Chapter 5

Calculate Risk Using a Risk Equation

A standardized approach to risk assessment helps to clarify risk tolerance and
determine where to focus resources. The risk equation facilitates conversations
about risk, investments, threats, vulnerabilities, assets, and countermeasures.
It emphasizes the totality of risk, not individual controls or technical issues.

## Chapter 6
Moving Forward with AI

The AI boom is happening worldwide. Not embracing it is
worse than standing still. Without AI, your security program
slides backwards.

AI’s top strengths are integrating technologies, connecting tools,
and automating workflows. It is transforming activities such as
threat detection, threat hunting, behavioral analytics, automated
incident response, vulnerability management, and security
orchestration. Old thinking may discount AI. New thinking views
AI as a powerful, necessary human assistant.

With help from AI, practitioners work efficiently and precisely,
whether it’s sifting through big data, eliminating noise, identifying
anomalies, analyzing historical trends, forecasting threats, or
completing other tasks. AI enables the predictive intelligence
that modernizes your security program:

*   Transform threat detection from a series of alerts into an
    intelligent early warning system.
*   Convert raw security data into a strategic advantage.
*   Build a unified defense that evolves as fast as the threats it faces.

One of the challenges in cybersecurity is the high volume of
indicators, a lot of which can be false positives. AI-pushed
structures use behavior analysis and system studying algorithms
to clear out and prioritize signals, ensuring that only credible
threats are flagged for human analysts. This notably reduces noise
and permits protection groups to focus on genuine problems.2

Invite AI Discussion

*   In which areas of our
    security program can
    AI assist practitioners to
    improve efficiency and
    reduce risk?
*   What are the integration
    options for workflow/
    ticketing systems and
    a large language model?
*   How do we develop
    training requirements
    and refine prompt
    engineering?
*   Which mechanisms
    or processes prevent
    hallucination?
*   How do we balance
    privacy and security
    using AI-driven
    systems?
