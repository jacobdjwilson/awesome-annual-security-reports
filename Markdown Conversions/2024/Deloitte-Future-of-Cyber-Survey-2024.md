## VIEW FROM THE TOP

### A NEW ERA OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CYBER STRATEGIES

#### Focusing on outcomes and resilience

The future of cyber is constantly evolving as organizations across the globe deal with ongoing business complexity and change, as well as a myriad of new threats and risks. Yet one thing remains constant: Cyber and business value are deeply intertwined, and cybersecurity stays central to how organizations in every industry consistently deliver the outcomes they desire.

That powerful connection between cybersecurity and business impact comes into sharp focus in Deloitte’s 4th Edition of The Global Future of Cyber Survey—which asked nearly 1,200 leaders in various industries worldwide to share their views on cyber threats, enterprise activities, and the future. The survey included C-suite executives across the enterprise, as well as other senior leaders with responsibility for IT, security, risk, and the business.

The focus on outcomes is growing stronger

In our previous report, the 3rd edition of the survey, Deloitte recognized the extent to which cyber was evolving into a distinct functional area of the business, transcending its traditional IT roots and becoming an essential part of the framework for delivering business outcomes.

In this 4th edition of the survey, we see that, in addition to cyber strategy being essential to unlocking greater business value, cybersecurity in practice has become increasingly integrated into technology transformation activities. We also see that the voice of cyber leadership—in particular, the CISO—has grown in importance, along with the emergence of a new cyber-savvy C-suite.

Despite the growing focus on cybersecurity, only about half (52%) of all respondents are very confident in the C-suite and board’s ability to adequately navigate cybersecurity. And specifically among C-suite respondents who are focused mainly on cybersecurity, only 34% are very confident—suggesting that they have less confidence in their abilities than others do.

But when we look just at organizations that Deloitte has classified as having high cyber maturity, we see two important findings: Cybersecurity is recognized at senior levels, and there is a strong correlation between organizations’ cyber maturity and having greater confidence in adequately navigating cybersecurity. In fact, among high-cyber-maturity organizations, that confidence in the C-suite and board grows to 82%—compared to 52% and 39% for medium- and low-cyber-maturity organizations, respectively.

The survey’s findings indicate that, on average, 86% of respondents are implementing actions to a moderate or large extent to increase cyber strategies and actions, embracing cyber as an essential component of the enterprise. And, on average, 85% of respondents expect to achieve their desired business outcomes to a moderate or large extent. While this underscores the critical role cyber plays in driving successful strategy implementation, not all organizations will realize those benefits equally.

And the more cyber-mature the organization, the bigger the potential impact. The survey found that respondents in high-cyber-maturity organizations anticipate almost two times the positive business outcomes compared with their peers. How these high-cyber-maturity organizations view cybersecurity—and how they are taking action—provides insights and a potential path for others to follow as they seek to increase their own cyber maturity.

*   52% of respondents are very confident in the C-suite and board’s ability to adequately navigate cybersecurity.
*   Respondents in high-cyber-maturity organizations anticipate almost two times the positive business outcomes compared with their peers.

### Cyber-mature organizations are more prepared and resilient

In this edition of the survey, Deloitte identified high-cyber-maturity organizations based on several factors. As in the previous edition of the survey, we assessed their level of strategic cybersecurity planning and specific cybersecurity activities, and engagement in cybersecurity at the board level. Based on these factors, among the most cyber-mature organizations, there is a clear sign that cybersecurity’s influence in supporting and shaping technology-driven projects has grown by three percentage points.

However, given the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, global organizations have experienced more sophisticated attacks. At the same time, opportunities have emerged to invest in AI-powered tools and cybersecurity solutions. Accordingly, we have updated the Deloitte cyber maturity index to include the extent to which respondents use AI capabilities within cybersecurity programs (see Cyber Maturity, page 25).

Among these high-cyber-maturity organizations, the CISO and other cybersecurity leaders are being called in as experts to help guide investments in cloud-driven business initiatives, AI-enabled activities, enterprise resource planning (ERP) modernization, and other digital transformation priorities. Put another way, cybersecurity is playing a large role in helping to secure funding for technology capabilities. The heightened focus on cybersecurity also means that the CISO is more involved in strategic conversations related to digital transformation.

While these high-cyber-maturity organizations are implementing foundational cyber actions—such as having a strategic and operational plan, cyber risk monitoring, and more—what is most notable is their ability to bounce back rapidly from cyberattacks. Being more cyber-mature does not make these organizations immune to threats. It makes them more resilient when they occur, to enable critical business continuity.

As compared to overall survey respondents, high-cyber-maturity organizations expect to achieve business outcomes by 27 percentage points more, on average, than global respondents overall. And they maintain those expectations despite reporting 11 or more cyber breaches in the past year (eight percentage points more than overall) and despite suffering negative consequences (on average seven percentage points more than overall). It may be that high-cyber-maturity organizations are identifying more cyber breaches—and therefore reporting more—not necessarily experiencing more.

The leaders of high-cyber-maturity organizations understand that being prepared to respond to and recover from the inevitable attack—to get their businesses back up and running quickly, and to serve their customers—is what matters most.

What are organizations hoping to prepare for (or avoid) as they become more resilient—and how has the picture changed? Compared with the previous edition of the survey, a loss of confidence in tech integrity (i.e., reliability, accuracy, and availability of systems and data) has risen to the top of the list as the number one negative consequence of cybersecurity incidents or breaches—becoming increasingly important as organizations accelerate their digital transformation journeys.

Operational disruption, including supply chain or partner ecosystem disruption, remains high on the list, in the number two spot, underscoring the importance of business continuity across partners and infrastructure. However, there is also a notable shift, as this was the top concern in the previous edition of the survey. Reputational loss climbed up one place as the number three concern (Figure 1).

The steps organizations take today should focus on how cyber investments can optimize, preserve, protect, and create value for the organization. That includes laying a strong foundation for future growth through cyber practices that enable data security and integrity across digital products and infrastructure. That foundation also should incorporate the fundamentals of a responsive infrastructure and digital ecosystem—for enabling future growth and business resilience. This edition of the survey shows a marked trend toward cyber programs and CISOs gaining greater strategic influence across all these value streams through more integrated technology transformation strategies—especially among the most cyber-mature organizations.

An effective approach to cybersecurity should extend beyond the traditional focus on incident response. It should delve into the core of how businesses need to integrate cyber—risk, security, and trust—into their overall strategy. Adopting a holistic, business-oriented perspective allows you to bridge broader business objectives and operational needs. This approach ensures that cyber is not just a reactive measure but a proactive, integral part of the organization’s strategic business, technology, and operational framework. Moreover, Deloitte’s research illustrates that the most cyber-mature organizations in the market are gaining significant value through a similar business-oriented approach.

## METHODOLOGY

### HOW WE DEVELOPED THE INSIGHTS

#### Behind the research

Deloitte also conducted in-depth interviews with senior cyber decision-makers across various industries and geographies, to glean more detailed insights and to help validate our observations. Our approach covered every aspect relevant to the future of cyber, from strategy to tactics and culture to technology implementation.

At the core of this research, we focused our efforts on exploring how cybersecurity has changed since the last edition of our report while applying a forward-looking lens, to help bring the future of cyber into sharper focus. We also wanted to get a clearer view into the cyber savviness of the C-suite today. Throughout the survey, we have looked to unlock insights for better understanding the cyber-related business value and impact organizations are experiencing, as well as the distinct actions that leading organizations are taking to increase value.

Deloitte designed the 4th Edition of The Global Future of Cyber Survey based on the complexity of today’s business and technology landscape, focusing on the needs of enterprise leaders who may recognize the importance of cybersecurity yet struggle to harness its value.

Deloitte based its research on a survey of nearly 1,200 cyber decision-makers at the director level or higher, including C-suite executives and their direct reports, covering a mix of business and IT functions. The survey reflects data gathered across 43 countries and six industries, and is limited to organizations with at least 1,000 employees and US$500 million in annual revenue.

#### Headquarters locations of the organizations we surveyed

*   30% Americas (North America, South America)
*   29% APAC (Asia Pacific)
*   41% EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa)

## KEY FINDINGS

### CYBER INFLUENCES STRATEGIC VALUE

#### Working toward a bigger business impact

We will examine how…

The path to cyber maturity is becoming even clearer as we look toward the future of cyber. Organizations that travel along that path will integrate cybersecurity risk strategies, security practices, and trust-building approaches into their business and technology transformation—enabled by a cyber-savvy C-suite and highly influential CISO. Those organizations can expect to see a bigger impact when it comes to measures of success, positioning their organizations to undertake transformation more effectively in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

As organizations take continuous steps toward becoming cyber mature, they can set themselves apart from their peers by prioritizing and building cybersecurity connections across their business and technology operations, and their leadership. Doing so will enable them to more successfully achieve the strategic outcomes that we saw being prioritized in the previous edition of the survey.

In this report, we will explore high-level insights grounded in data from the survey, the cyber maturity index, and insights from global leaders, to show how and where high-performing organizations are standing out and to guide global cybersecurity professionals on how to become more mature in their cyber practices.

1.  Cybersecurity remains an essential element for strategic business value—and the focus is intensifying.
2.  The CISO’s influence is growing across an increasingly cyber-savvy C-suite.
3.  Cybersecurity has become deeply integrated with tech-driven programs and digital business transformation.
4.  Organizations with greater cyber maturity are more confident and realizing greater benefits from their cyber actions and investments.

### Cybersecurity remains an essential element for strategic business value—and the focus is intensifying.

The foundational importance of cybersecurity is undeniable in today’s deeply interconnected digital environment. And organizations have no shortage of activities/actions and strategic levers they can pull to bolster their cyber readiness to enhance business value.

#### Taking action is a first step, but not the only step

Most respondents are taking the need for cybersecurity action seriously, with 86% of them implementing specific activities/actions to a moderate or large extent to increase cybersecurity. This level of action suggests that organizations overwhelmingly understand the need for these activities and a robust cybersecurity program to implement them. It also suggests that they are keeping pace as the list of activities they need to stay on top of continues to grow.

These respondents are focusing on a variety of activities for managing cybersecurity, including but not limited to: mitigating risks, enhancing cybersecurity controls, improving incident response, increasing employee awareness, and adopting a strategic cybersecurity plan.

> “It’s really about getting the basics right and maturing them and being excellent at them, every day, consistently. Things like foundational controls, asset management, vulnerability management. You really need to excel there, almost mindlessly. They just have to happen.”
>
> — CISO, Life Sciences and Healthcare Organization

When we project those activities through the lens of cyber maturity, we see that organizations with high cyber maturity undertake these actions to a greater extent compared to less cyber-mature organizations (Figure 2, see also Cyber Maturity, page 25).
