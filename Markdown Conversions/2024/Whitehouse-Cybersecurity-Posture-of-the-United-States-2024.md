National Cyber Directorii 
Letter from the National Cyber DirectorI am pleased to present the 2024 Report on the Cybersecurity Posture of the United States.This 
first\-ever report provides important updates on how the Nation is addressing the challenges and 
opportunities we face in cyberspace.We have made progress in realizing an affirmative vision 
for a safe, prosperous, and equitable digital future, but the threats we face remain daunting, our 
defenses are not impregnable, and our work continues to evolve to meet the changing landscape.Simply put, we are in the midst of a fundamental transformation in our Nations cybersecurity.
It is now clear that a reactive posture cannot keep pace with fast\-evolving cyber threats and a 
dynamic technology landscape, and that aspiring just to manage the worst effects of cyber 
incidents is no longer sufficient to ensure our national security, economic prosperity, and 
democratic values.Beginning with Executive Order 14028 on Improving the Nations 
Cybersecurity, the Biden\-Harris Administration has advanced an affirmative vision centered on 
proactively and strategically shaping the digital world around us, positioning it to enable every 
aspect of our economy and society.The Presidents National Cybersecurity Strategy asserts that it is necessary to fundamentally shift 
the underlying dynamics of the digital world to make it defensible, resilient, and aligned with our 
values.If we succeed, the digital ecosystem can be a strong foundation for a prosperous, 
connected future that benefits every American.While we remain postured to forcefully respond 
to malicious cyber threats, we will not let our adversaries dictate our path forward.Implementing this new vision requires a collaborative, whole\-of\-nation effort.The most capable 
and best\-positioned actors in cyberspace, in both public and private sectors, need to do more to 
reshape the digital ecosystem and protect the vulnerable.We are committed to working closely 
with our partners in the private sector, with State, local, Tribal, and territorial entities, and with 
like\-minded nations around the world to enhance our collective resilience to cyber threats.Congress has also been a vital partner in this implementation process, and we will continue to 
engage with Congress to ensure that departments and agencies have the resources and authorities 
they need.With no shortage of challenges on the horizon, the Administration and Congress must 
continue to work together in a nonpartisan manner to advance U.S. cybersecurity and resilience.As the President stated at the Strategys launch, The steps we take and choices we make today 
will determine the direction of our world for decades to come.We need to build on the 
successes of the past year, learn lessons from where we fell short, and take on hard challenges 
such as harmonizing cybersecurity regulations, empowering Sector Risk Management Agencies, 
and supporting smaller organizations facing down capable adversaries. Together, we will build a 
digital world that keeps Americans safe from cyber threats and enables our grandest ambitions.

Executive SummaryThe 2024 Report on the Cybersecurity Posture of the United States assesses the cybersecurity 
posture of the United States, the effectiveness of national cyber policy and strategy, and the 
status of the implementation of national cyber policy and strategy by Federal departments and 
agencies.Additionally, this report highlights cybersecurity threats and issues facing the United 
States, including new or emerging technologies that may affect national security, economic 
prosperity, and the rule of law.This is the first edition of the report and covers calendar year 
2023, with additional consideration of developments in 2024 preceding the publication of this 
report.Over the past year, U.S. national cybersecurity posture improved, driven by steady progress 
towards the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategys (NCS) vision of a defensible, resilient, and 
values\-aligned digital ecosystem achieved through fundamental shifts in the underlying 
dynamics that shape cyberspace.The Administration has successfully begun implementation of 
the NCS Implementation Plan, which coordinates actions by departments and agencies across the 
Federal Government to make the Presidents affirmative vision a reality.These initial 
implementation actions set the foundation for further investment and sustained commitment by 
stakeholders across the digital ecosystem.The Strategic Environment 
This report begins with an assessment of the strategic environment, the landscape of emerging 
technologies and cyber risks that present both challenges and opportunities for U.S. 
cybersecurity policy and strategy.The analysis of emerging technologies considers not just their 
internal technical characteristics, but also their integration into complex systems and processes, 
their connection to people and workers, and their relationship to institutions and governance 
structures.This report also examines the cyber risk landscape, considering both trends in threat 
actor capability and intent, as well as the evolving vulnerabilities in our own defenses that create 
pathways for these adversaries to exploit.In 2023, the strategic environment was characterized by complexity, interconnectivity, and 
competition.Continued progress in digital communications, advanced computing, quantum 
information science, data storage and processing, and other critical and emerging technologies 
are rapidly increasing the complexity of our economy and society.These technologies also 
connect people around the world, enable the proliferation of cyber\-physical systems, and create 
new dependencies between critical infrastructure and essential services across every sector.As 
this landscape evolves, malicious state and non\-state actors are exploiting its seams with growing 
capability and strategic purpose, making clear that cyberspace is closely aligned with other 
domains of international conflict and competition.

Five trends, in addition to enduring cybersecurity challenges, drove change in the strategic 
environment in 2023\.1\. Evolving Risks to Critical Infrastructure: Nation\-state adversaries demonstrated a 
growing willingness to use cyber capabilities to compromise and hold at risk critical 
infrastructure systems and assets with no inherent espionage value, in order to further 
their broader strategic objectives.2\. Ransomware: Ransomware remained a persistent threat to national security, public 
safety, and economic prosperity, and ransomware groups continued to develop 
sophisticated strategies to evade or circumvent defensive and disruptive measures 
designed to frustrate their activities.3\. Supply Chain Exploitation: Complex and interconnected supply chains for software and 
other information technology and services enabled malicious actors to compromise 
victims at scale.4\. Commercial Spyware: There was a growing market for sophisticated and invasive 
cyber\-surveillance tools sold to nation\-state actors by private vendors to access electronic 
devices remotely, monitor and extract their content, and manipulate their components 
without the knowledge or consent of the devices users.5\. Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most powerful, publicly 
accessible technologies of our time, and its continued evolution in 2023 presented 
opportunities and challenges for cyber risk management at scale.Current Efforts 
Addressing the challenges and seizing the opportunities presented by the strategic environment 
requires a coherent program of action led by the Federal Government and aligned with private 
sector efforts.The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) coordinates the 
implementation of national cyber policy and strategy, including the NCS, by driving new actions 
and uplifting and connecting work underway.This report reflects important contributions to 
national cybersecurity made by departments and agencies across the Federal Government.The National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan (NCSIP), released in July 2023, 
guides Federal efforts to realize the vision of the NCS and is updated on an annual basis.In 
NCSIP Version 1, the Federal Government was responsible for completing 36 initiatives by the 
second quarter of 2024\.As detailed in this report, 33 of these 36 (92%) initiatives were 
completed on time and three remain underway.An additional 33 NCSIP Version 1 initiatives 
have completion dates over the next two years and are on track.

v 
Actions taken by the Federal Government during the period covered by this report include:1\. Establishing and Using Cyber Requirements to Protect Critical Infrastructure, 
including through the development and harmonization of regulatory requirements in 
multiple critical infrastructure sectors.2\. Enhancing Federal Cooperation and Partnerships to better support cyber defenders, 
including by increasing operational collaboration, improving Sector Risk Management 
Agency (SRMA) capacity, and integrating Federal cyber defense capabilities.3\. Improving Incident Preparedness and Response by rapidly sharing threat information, 
prioritizing support to victims, and reviewing significant incidents and campaigns to 
derive lessons learned.4\. Disrupting and Degrading Adversary Activity using all tools of national power, 
resulting in coordinated, high\-impact disruption campaigns against a wide range of 
malicious cyber actors.5\. Defending Federal Networks at speed and scale, including by integrating Zero Trust 
Architecture principles across the Federal enterprise, modernizing legacy technology 
systems, and expanding the use of shared services.6\. Strengthening the National Cyber Workforce, including through the promulgation of a 
National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy (NCWES) and engagement with 
workers, employers, students, and educators across the country.7\. Advancing Software Security to Produce Safer Products and Services, including by 
advancing Secure by Design principles, Software Bills of Material (SBOM), and 
memory\-safe programming languages.8\. Enabling a Digital Economy that Empowers and Protects Consumers, including by 
launching a U.S. Cyber Trust Mark certification and labeling program and by promoting 
competition and accountability across the technology industry.9\. Investing in Resilient Next\-Generation Technologies across the clean energy economy, 
issuing an executive order to guide Federal efforts related to artificial intelligence, and 
addressing security challenges present in the technical foundations of the Internet.10\. Managing Risks to Data Security and Privacy by enabling safe, data\-rich cross\-border 
commerce and promoting the development of privacy\-enhancing technologies.11\. Enhancing Resilience Across the Globe by building coalitions of like\-minded nations to 
provide support to victims of ransomware and other cyberattacks, align national policy, 
and promote secure and resilient global supply chains.

1\. Advancing a Rights\-Respecting Digital Ecosystem by advancing an affirmative vision 
of an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, accessible, and secure Internet; 
combatting the proliferation and misuse of digital technologies like commercial spyware; 
and shaping emerging technologies to align with democratic values and human rights.Future Outlook 
In 2024 and beyond, the Federal Government will build on accomplishments of the past year, 
continue to implement the NCS and NCWES, and adapt its approach to address emergent 
challenges and opportunities presented by an evolving strategic landscape.It will be necessary 
to sustain efforts to enhance the capabilities of Sector Risk Management Agencies, strengthen 
the national cyber workforce, implement incident reporting requirements directed by the Cyber 
Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), enhance the speed and scale 
of adversary disruption campaigns, improve analytics and information sharing mechanisms, 
continue to invest in quantum information science, and prioritize cybersecurity in foreign 
assistance mechanisms.The next iteration of the NCS implementation plan, NCSIP Version 2, outlines 31 new initiatives 
that build on shared accomplishments of the past year and establish new lines of effort to 
continue to implement the NCS.NCSIP Version 2 has been published alongside this report and 
is available online at www.whitehouse.govoncd.

IntroductionA fundamental transformation is underway.At the core of this transformation are new 
technologies which we have made foundational to our national security, our economy, our 
democracy, and our modern way of life.Innovations in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
quantum information science (QIS), and microelectronics are revolutionizing the advanced 
computing landscape.Our digital and physical worlds are increasingly connected, in both 
industrial applications and consumer\-facing products.Growing access to high\-speed Internet 
and the proliferation of next\-generation telecommunications networks are connecting people and 
systems around the world.As this digital ecosystem evolves, our adversaries have repeatedly demonstrated their capability 
and intent to exploit its vulnerabilities.Both state and non\-state actors continue to aggressively 
conduct malicious cyber activity that threatens U.S. national security, public safety, and 
economic prosperity.Critical infrastructure across the United States has been held at risk by the 
Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and other adversaries who threaten our essential services and 
public safety in service of their geopolitical ambitions.Ransomware groups have built a 
business model around targeting schools, hospitals, small businesses, and many others ill\-
equipped to defend themselves.In this decisive moment, the Biden\-Harris Administration put forth a new approach centered on 
proactively shaping our shared, digitally\-enabled future.Released in March 2023, the 
Presidents National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) articulates a new, affirmative vision of a 
digital ecosystem that is defensible, resilient, and aligned with our values.The NCS moves away 
from previous approaches that were predicated on managing threat actors in a digital ecosystem 
that advantaged their malicious activity.Instead, the NCS calls for two fundamental shifts in 
how we allocate roles, responsibilities, and resources in cyberspace by (1\) rebalancing the 
responsibility to defend cyberspace away from end users and to the most capable and best\-
positioned actors in the public and private sectors, and (2\) realigning incentives to favor long\-
term investments in future resilience.The NCS recognizes the need for modern and nimble regulatory frameworks for critical 
infrastructure cybersecurity.The NCS targets market interventions, such as device labeling 
programs and a software liability regime, to address economic dynamics that contribute to poor 
cybersecurity outcomes.Where technical vulnerabilities create pervasive challenges for cyber 
defenders, the NCS calls for coordinated investment in standards and research and development 
to eliminate them.And, as the NCS makes clear, investing in talent is a key part of investing in 
our digital future.The 2023 National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy (NCWES) 
outlines a comprehensive approach aimed at addressing both immediate and long\-term cyber 
workforce needs while empowering every American to participate in our digital ecosystem.With this new strategic course set, the Administration has turned to the vital work of 
implementation.Successful implementation is at its core a collaborative endeavor, requiring 
contributions from across the Federal Government, industry, academia, civil society, and other 
partners around the world.Congress has provided essential support to the implementation 
process by empowering departments and agencies with necessary authorities and resources.

2Version 1 of the NCS Implementation Plan (NCSIP) lays out a roadmap of 69 initiatives for the 
Federal Government to carry out to achieve the NCSs objectives. To date, the cybersecurity 
community has completed 33 items in the first year of the NCSIP, and undertaken countless 
other efforts to make cyberspace safer and more secure.The next iteration of the NCSIP, 
Version 2, builds on successes achieved in the first year of implementation, responds to 
emerging and unexpected challenges, and outlines 31 new initiatives to implement the 2023 
NCS.This report highlights key implementation efforts, accomplishments, and trends from the 
past year to demonstrate how the United States is proactively and strategically shaping the digital 
ecosystem to make it more defensible, resilient, and aligned with our values.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES

The Strategic EnvironmentThe strategic environment consists of an evolving ecosystem of people, technologies, and 
institutions, as well as the malicious actors who exploit vulnerabilities in this ecosystem to cause 
harm.The Office of the Director of National Intelligences 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of 
the U.S. Intelligence Community makes clear that both state and non\-state actors continue to 
pursue cyber capabilities that threaten U.S. national interests in cyberspace and beyond.The 
PRC, in particular, remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. Government, 
private sector, and critical infrastructure networks.Nation\-state actors from Russia, Iran, and the 
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK), as well as transnational criminal organizations 
and other non\-state actors, are responsible for a wide range of malicious activity that impacts the 
United States and our allies and partners.However, the cyber risk landscape is defined by more than these actors and their malicious 
activities.Threat is only one component of risk, and remedying vulnerabilities in cyberspace, 
enhancing our resilience, or otherwise mitigating the consequences of successful cyber incidents 
are more directly within our control.In analyzing the strategic environment, this report 
considers the combination of adversary capability and intent, the distribution and severity of 
vulnerabilities in our digital ecosystem, and the processes and policies we deploy to address 
these challenges.Below, we highlight both enduring cybersecurity challenges and the emergent 
trends that drove change in the strategic environment this year.Our strategic environment is characterized by growing complexity, interconnectivity, and 
competition, as critical and emerging technologies further accelerate the pace of change and 
require us to rapidly reimagine risks and opportunities in a digitally\-enabled world.Advanced 
computing technologies, the convergence of digital and physical systems, and the presence of 
new actors across our critical infrastructure landscape make for a complex world where risks can 
be difficult to identify.Sprawling supply chains, widening access to communications networks, 
and interdependent global infrastructures have led to an increasingly interconnected world.
Simultaneously, the strategic environment has become increasingly competitive, as both state 
and non\-state actors pursue their interests using sophisticated cyber capabilities.Geopolitical 
conflict is increasingly playing out in cyberspace, amplifying risks to U.S. and allied critical 
infrastructure.Enduring Cybersecurity ChallengesCyber defenders face more adversaries than ever, as a growing number of state\-affiliated, 
criminal, and ideologically\-motivated actors launch cyber operations against the United States.
These adversaries benefit from longstanding structural asymmetries, including the fact that 
attackers can begin exploiting vulnerabilities before defenders can develop and deploy patches, 
and network interdependencies that allow exploitation of victims at scale.Enduring use of 
insecure practices by the software development community, such as programming in memory 
unsafe languages, further advantages attackers.Additionally, challenges in attribution enable 
malicious actors to obfuscate their behavior to avoid consequences.

Legacy protocols and technical architectures with poor security attributes are deeply 
embedded across the digital ecosystem, from legacy mobile networks to how we route data 
across the Internet.The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which directs Internet traffic, is 
susceptible to traffic hijacking and route manipulation.Attackers can also leverage weaknesses 
in outdated encryption protocols to compromise communications.Emerging digital technologies often present adversaries with new opportunities for malicious 
exploitation.The development of a viable large\-scale quantum computer, for example, promises 
tremendous economic benefits, potentially creating entirely new industries and revolutionizing 
our digital ecosystem.However, we have known for decades that quantum computing has the 
potential to break many widely used cryptographic systems that keep our information safe.In 
the wrong hands, a sufficiently mature quantum computer would challenge the integrity of the 
digital ecosystem, threaten sensitive health and personal financial data, and defeat security 
protocols for most Internet\-based nancial transactions.Critical infrastructure owners and operators rely on third\-party service providers to manage 
key aspects of their digital operations.The adoption of cloud services, for example, can enable 
better and more economical cybersecurity outcomes at scale, but cloud migration may also 
present novel cybersecurity risks.Hybrid deployments, in which organizations use both locally 
hosted systems and cloud assets, can introduce complex centralized logging and authentication 
regimes, creating opportunities for malicious actors to evade detection and abuse identity 
management systems.The 2023 PRC compromise of U.S. government communications 
demonstrates the necessity of maintaining comprehensive logging.More broadly, as 
organizations migrate increasing amounts of data and processes to the cloud, this shift introduces 
new cross\-sector dependencies and complicates systemic risk identification and management, 
particularly where multiple organizations rely on third\-party services from the same provider.Our critical infrastructure landscape is characterized by private ownership and operation, 
which results in interdependencies between public and private sectors and which requires a 
national cybersecurity posture rooted in public\-private action, collaboration, and partnership.
The rapidly expanding space industry illustrates how advances in technology create new 
challenges and opportunities for collaboration to manage shared cyber risk.A growing number 
of critical infrastructure assets rely upon space\-based systems for communications, sensing, 
navigation, and timing.In the days leading up to Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine, a 
cyberattack against a U.S. space communications company, ostensibly intended to disrupt 
Ukrainian telecommunications, also led to outages for computer systems used by thousands of 
European wind turbines.As the space ecosystem continues to evolve and integrate new 
commercial participants, the cybersecurity of space systems will be a shared responsibility.Americas cyber workforce continues to grapple with a persistent need for more trained 
cybersecurity professionals and a better cyber education ecosystem.Getting more Americans 
involved in the cyber workforce not only strengthens our national cybersecurity outcomes, it also 
provides access to good\-paying, middle\-class jobs.We must develop cyber talent through 
formal and informal cyber education and training systems as a matter of economic development 
and national security.While U.S. schools, governments, non\-profits, and companies have made 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
5 
strides in developing American cyber talent, these investments have lacked the scale and 
coordination necessary to meet increasing demand.Top Trends of 2023Evolving Risks to Critical InfrastructureU.S. critical infrastructure faces evolving and unacceptable cyber risks.Nation\-state adversaries 
are developing cyber capabilities and gaining accesses with the intent of disrupting or destroying 
U.S. and allied critical infrastructure.Such disruptions could support or enable an adversarys 
strategic objectives outside of the cyber domain and pose challenges for risk management within 
and across critical infrastructure sectors.While adversaries pre\-positioning for cyberattacks is a long\-standing threat, the PRCs pre\-
positioning activity is a threat unlike any America has previously faced.In 2023, a PRC actor 
tracked as Volt Typhoon gained access to critical infrastructure in the United States and the 
Indo\-Pacific region.Critically, this campaign targeted U.S. entities that presented little value 
from an espionage or intelligence perspective, but which could enable disruption of operational 
technology systems in critical infrastructure and interference with U.S. and allied warfighting 
capabilities.Also in 2023, PRC actors tracked as BlackTech used sophisticated tools to 
compromise routers and gain access to a wide variety of U.S. and Japanese critical infrastructure.
These intrusions demonstrated the PRCs intention to hold at risk U.S. and allied critical 
infrastructure, shape U.S. decision\-making in a time of crisis, and use cyber capabilities to 
augment PRC geopolitical objectives.RansomwareRansomware remains a persistent threat to national security, public safety, and economic 
prosperity.Comprehensive data on the full scope of the ransomware threat is difficult to obtain, 
particularly with cyber incident reporting requirements still evolving and victims reluctant to 
share information about attacks.Following a brief decrease in 2022, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3\) received a 22% increase in reported 
ransomware incidents from American victims.Reports to the IC3 also reflected a 74% increase 
in the cost of ransomware incidents in 2023, relative to 2022\.Established ransomware groups are continuing to develop sophisticated strategies to monetize 
their accesses and evade or circumvent defensive measures designed to frustrate their activities.
Attackers have increased the use of double and triple extortion attacks, not only encrypting 
victims data but also threatening to sell or publicly release that data if a ransom is not paid, and 
sometimes also threatening to dox victims if they do not pay an additional fee.Victims who 
make these additional ransomware payments rely on their attackers promise to delete exfiltrated 
data and refrain from doxing attacks, a promise that is not always kept.Ransomware actors form 
conspiracies with each other, dividing up the work of developing and deploying malware, 
carrying out attacks on individual targets, and collecting cryptocurrency ransoms.This form of 
criminal economic specialization has made the ransomware threat especially potent.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
6 
Supply Chain ExploitationComplex and interconnected supply chains for software and other information technology and 
services, combined with growing reliance on common third\-party service providers, create 
opportunities for sophisticated adversaries to access victims at scale and complicate the efforts of 
defenders to identify and manage cybersecurity risks.Adversaries are increasingly taking 
advantage of complex and interconnected relationships between organizations and their 
suppliers, customers, vendors, and service providers, compromising single nodes that grant 
surreptitious access to victims in the United States and around the world.In 2023, several high\-profile compromises of technology providers impacted thousands of 
connected victims, including critical infrastructure owners and operators.In December, Russias 
Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) targeted servers used by computer programmers to compile 
and test software, presumably intending to maliciously modify developers source code.Earlier 
in the year, a compromise of a widely used identity and access management firm enabled 
malicious actors to steal credentials and session tokens that could provide surreptitious access to 
thousands of customers.And, at the beginning of the year, a popular enterprise communications 
suite was compromised in an entirely separate supply chain attack, demonstrating how a single 
initial compromise can quickly spread through interlinked technology supply chains and third\-
party relationships.Commercial SpywareThere is a growing market for sophisticated and invasive end\-to\-end cyber\-surveillance tools 
sold by private vendors to access electronic devices remotely, monitor and extract their content, 
and manipulate their components without the knowledge or consent of the devices users.
Commercial spyware providers now offer world\-class capabilities to the highest bidder, who 
often employ these capabilities in cyber operations that are not subject to oversight or regulatory 
constraints.While the commercial spyware industry has a long history, the recent proliferation 
and misuse of these tools allows malicious cyber actors to target journalists, activists, human 
rights defenders, and government officials with greater frequency.A growing number of authoritarian regimes and democratic governments have misused 
commercial spyware to surveil targets; intimidate perceived opponents; suppress dissent; limit 
freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, or association; and otherwise abuse human rights.
Some foreign governments and persons have deployed commercial spyware against U.S. 
government personnel, information, and computer systems, presenting significant 
counterintelligence and security risks to the United States.The misuse of these tools also 
threatens the security and privacy of individuals in the United States and around the world.Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most powerful technologies of our time, and it continues 
to receive substantial public attention and media coverage.Advances in large\-language 
models (LLMs) and other foundational algorithms, combined with more affordable computing 
power and access to data, have given rise to a new generation of AI tools.These tools captured 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
7 
the publics imagination in 2023, as Americans experienced novel applications such as chatbots 
and image generators.AI will almost certainly continue to evolve at a rapid pace in the years to 
come, with public and private entities around the world vying for profit and competitive 
advantage.The evolving AI landscape will present cyber defenders with new opportunities to defend critical 
infrastructure against malicious activity.The cybersecurity community has a long history of 
harnessing the power of machine learning techniques for basic tasks like data processing, email 
filtering, and malware identification.New cyber defense tools that integrate AI could eventually 
enable cyber defenders to more efficiently detect anomalous network traffic and other adversary 
activity, coordinate the defense of complex systems and networks, and augment a cybersecurity 
workforce that is already stretched thin.AI tools may also make our software development ecosystem safer and more secure.While 
LLMs have shown some fluency in programming languages, they cannot yet generate 
commercially useful secure code without human intervention.Responsible integration of AI 
tools into the software development lifecycle may enable developers to identify vulnerabilities in 
new code and suggest potential fixes.As AI tools mature, they could be able to make widely 
used software products more secure by rewriting existing code into a memory\-safe programming 
language.However, realizing the promise of AI also challenges us to manage the risks it poses to 
cybersecurity.Today, LLMs can quickly and cheaply generate persuasive and micro\-targeted 
text, images, audio, and video in different languages.Cybercriminals, hacktivists, and others 
with limited resources and technical sophistication may use these capabilities to conduct 
phishing campaigns, information operations, and other malicious cyber activity.AI\-enabled 
surveillance and censorship technologies enable authoritarian regimes to more effectively and 
efficiently target journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders.Without safeguards, AI 
technologies may also put Americans privacy at risk by making it easier to extract, identify, and 
exploit personal data.As the AI ecosystem continues to evolve, there is an opportunity to ensure 
that its core elementsdata, computing, and algorithmsare developed with safeguards against 
misuse.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES

Current EffortsThe Federal Government is undertaking a bold program of action to implement the NCS and 
proactively shape the digital ecosystem to align with U.S. national objectives.These efforts 
build on generational investments in new infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law (BIL), Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and CHIPS and Science Act; cybersecurity 
legislation such as CIRCIA; and executive actions including Executive Order (EO) 14028 on 
Improving the Nations Cybersecurity, National Security Memorandum (NSM) 5 on Improving 
Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems, and NSM\-8 on Improving the 
Cybersecurity of National Security, Department of Defense, and Intelligence Systems.NCSIP Version 1, released in July 2023, guides Federal efforts to realize the vision of the NCS 
through 69 high\-impact initiatives, from combatting cybercrime to building a skilled cyber 
workforce to addressing security challenges present in the technical foundations of the Internet. 
In NCSIP Version 1, the Federal Government was responsible for completing 36 initiatives by 
the second quarter of 2024\.As detailed in the table below, 33 of these 36 (92%) initiatives were 
completed on time and three remain underway.An additional 33 NCSIP Version 1 initiatives 
have completion dates over the next two years and are on track.Alongside this report, ONCD has published NCSIP Version 2, which builds on successes 
achieved in the first year of implementation, responds to evolving challenges, and outlines 31 
new initiatives to implement the 2023 NCS.Twenty\-four agencies are leading initiatives in 
NCSIP Version 2, with six new agencies joining the implementation effort to achieve the vision 
of the NCS.Further details on progress made on initiatives in NCSIP Version 1 and ongoing and 
new initiatives in NCSIP Version 2 can be found online at www.whitehouse.govoncd.NCS Implementation ProgressNCSIP

Establishing and Using Cyber Requirements to Protect Critical InfrastructureThe NCS calls for the use of incentives and requirements to align the interests of individuals and 
organizations with our collective goals of national security, public safety, and economic 
prosperity.The Federal Governments proactive approach to cybersecurity requirements 
recognizes that every sector must be accounted for.Where cybersecurity requirements do not 
exist or are poorly defined, we are pursuing new requirements that are agile enough to adapt as 
adversaries increase their capabilities and change tactics.Where the regulatory landscape is 
already mature, we are working to harmonize and align new and existing regulatory 
requirements.We are also paying close attention to regulatory action in other countries where 
such efforts can serve as a model, or where these actions may impact U.S. critical infrastructure 
owners, operators, or third\-party service providers.In the past year, new or updated cybersecurity rules went into effect across several critical 
infrastructure sectors.The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued updated 
requirements for oil and natural gas pipelines, airport and aircraft operators, and rail carriers.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted new rules requiring public companies 
to disclose information related to material cybersecurity incidents and risk management 
practices.In the healthcare and public health (HPH) sector, an amendment to the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, one of the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) authorizing statutes, 
now requires manufacturers of certain types of medical devices to design, develop, and maintain 
cybersecure medical devices, including through the creation of comprehensive lists of software 
components.FDA also finalized updated recommendations for medical device manufacturers to 
comply with FDA rules related to medical device cybersecurity.For the Defense Industrial 
Base (DIB), the Department of Defense (DoD) released revisions to its Cybersecurity Maturity 
Model Certification program to establish new requirements for DIB contractors and sub\-
contractors and expanded access to the voluntary DIB Cybersecurity (CS) Program.And, in the 
maritime sector, the President signed EO 14116 on Amending Regulations Relating to the 
Safeguarding of Vessels, Harbors, Ports, and Waterfront Facilities of the United States 
alongside the U.S. Coast Guard issuing a Maritime Security Directive and Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM) to bolster port and maritime cybersecurity.Across all critical infrastructure sectors, implementation of CIRCIA will establish new 
requirements for covered entities to report certain cybersecurity incidents to the Federal 
Government.In March 2024, CISA published an NPRM setting out proposed regulations for 
cyber incident and ransom payment reporting, as well as other aspects of the CIRCIA regulatory 
program.The information contained in these reports will provide increased visibility into 
malicious cyber activity, improve our understanding of cross\-sector risks, and strengthen our 
collective defense.The Federal Government is prioritizing measures to harmonize baseline regulatory requirements 
across sectors.Chaired by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Cybersecurity 
Forum for Independent and Executive Branch Regulators enables Federal agencies to coordinate 
efforts to improve the effectiveness and consistency of regulatory activity.In September 2023, 
the Cyber Incident Reporting Council delivered a report to Congress on streamlining and 
harmonizing Federal cyber incident reporting requirements. 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
11In July 2023, ONCD invited public responses to a Request for Information on opportunities for, 
and obstacles to, harmonizing baseline cybersecurity requirements for critical infrastructure and 
related assessments and audits.Respondents stressed the importance of leveraging existing 
frameworks and best practices, such as the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), to facilitate reciprocity, and recommended 
that ONCD work with the federal regulatory agencies to deconflict current and emerging 
cybersecurity requirements to drive harmonization.Requirements are most often effective when they align with existing cybersecurity frameworks, 
voluntary consensus standards, and other technical guidance.In March 2023, CISA updated its 
Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) based on stakeholder input and engaged SRMAs to 
begin to develop sector\-specific goals through a phased approach.In February 2024, NIST 
published version 2\.0 of its CSF, which provides updated guidance on managing an evolving 
cybersecurity risk landscape, implementation, and measuring effectiveness.In the energy sector, 
the Department of Energy (DOE) partnered with the National Association of Regulatory Utility 
Commissioners (NARUC) to develop cybersecurity baselines for electric distribution systems 
and distributed energy resources. In February 2024, NARUC and DOE publicly released the 
baselines and kicked off phase two to develop implementation strategies and adoption guidelines 
with state regulatory bodies and industry.Enhancing Federal Coordination and PartnershipsThe Federal Government is modernizing its critical infrastructure protection policies to ensure 
that Federal cyber capabilities are exercised in a clear, coordinated, and effective manner.In 
April 2024, the Administration issued NSM\-22 on Critical Infrastructure Security and 
Resilience, replacing Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD\-21\) as the Federal Governments 
primary policy document governing critical infrastructure security and resilience.Released more 
than 10 years ago, PPD\-21 defined 16 critical sectors and assigned responsibility for identifying 
and managing cyber and other all\-hazards risks.NSM\-22 strengthens the Federal Governments 
ability to enable cross\-sector cyber defense; clarifies CISAs role as the National Coordinator for 
the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure; improves connectivity with other Federal 
agencies serving as SRMAs; and enhances integration and information sharing with law 
enforcement, the intelligence community, and critical infrastructure owners and operators.
NSM\-22 also better positions the Federal Government to balance collaboration with regulation, 
directing SRMAs and sector\-specific regulators to develop minimum security requirements.
CISA, as the National Coordinator, will engage with SRMAs to develop updated risk 
assessments and the National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan.CISA plays a central role in enabling critical infrastructure owners and operators to defend 
themselves.In 2023, CISAs Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) completed three joint 
cyber defense plans to enhance the cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure partners.
JCDCs remote monitoring and management (RMM) and open\-source software (OSS) plans 
manage cross sector risk by addressing the exploitation of RMM software and producing best 
practice guidance for the secure use of OSS in operational technology, respectively.JCDC also 
published an incident response guide for the water and wastewater sector to support small\- and 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
12 
medium\-sized utilities.CISA established the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVMP) 
program as authorized by CIRCIA to identify commonly exploited vulnerabilities related to 
ransomware activity, and warn critical infrastructure entities so that they can mitigate the risk. In 
2023, this program notified critical infrastructure owners and operators of 1,754 vulnerable 
devices.And, in November 2023, CISA launched a voluntary pilot program to provide 
organizations in the healthcare, water and wastewater, and education sectors with cybersecurity 
shared services.SRMAs further enable the Federal Government to support and engage with critical infrastructure 
owners and operators at scale.In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
released a new strategy for healthcare cybersecurity; updated its Health Industry Cybersecurity 
Practices Guide in collaboration with the Health Sector Coordinating Council; launched the Risk 
Identification and Site Criticality Tool version 2\.0; and partnered with CISA to develop sector\-
specific CPGs.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a new cybersecurity risk 
assessment resource for water and wastewater systems and, in partnership with CISA and the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), developed an incident response guide for the sector.The 
Treasury Department established the Cloud Executive Steering Group to enhance cooperation 
between regulators and financial services organizations to address benefits and challenges 
associated with cloud adoption.DOE, through the Cyber Testing for Resilient Industrial Control 
Systems (CyTRICS) program, has established new partnerships with key private sector 
organizations to strengthen the cybersecurity of priority energy system component software, 
hardware, and firmware.The Federal Government is focused on supplementing SRMAs traditional strengths in 
information sharing and stakeholder engagement with more robust capabilities for operational 
collaboration with the private sector, including planning, exercises, and incident response.The 
National Security Agency (NSA) collaborates with private sector partners to defend National 
Security Systems (NSS), U.S. military assets, and the DIB against cyber threats.The NSAs 
Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (CCC) provides a scalable, intelligence\-driven mechanism 
for public\-private collaboration with the DIB and their service providers, totaling over 750 
partnerships in 2023 and further enabling collaborative defense against malicious cyber activity 
that threatens other critical infrastructure sectors.The CCC continues to expand its cybersecurity 
support to the DIB, including through providing Protective Domain Name System, Attack 
Surface Management, and threat intelligence collaboration services.In response to cyberattacks affecting U.S. school systems, the White House convened a forum to 
coordinate public and private measures to strengthen the cybersecurity of K\-12 schools.The 
Department of Education established a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) to enhance 
communication among education subsector stakeholders and improve cybersecurity resilience 
efforts.The FBI continues to engage with school districts across the country through its 56 field 
offices to enable on\-the\-ground cyber threat response services.CISA is providing additional 
resources to support the education subsector, including developing subsector\-specific guidance 
in partnership with the Department of Education and providing tailored assessments, exercise 
support, and training to K\-12 stakeholders.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
13 
The National Space Council, the National Security Council Cybersecurity Directorate, and 
ONCD are also coordinating public and private efforts to address unique challenges related to 
space system cybersecurity.In 2023, ONCD convened a series of regional technical workshops 
with government and industry space experts to discuss cybersecurity challenges and 
opportunities.In July, NIST released an updated report on cyber risk management practices 
related to commercial satellite operations.In October, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) issued a best practices guide to address new challenges by increasingly 
integrated and interconnected space systems.State, local, Tribal and territorial (SLTT) governments are working to elevate their cybersecurity 
posture.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $1 billion in funding to boost SLTT 
capacity to address cybersecurity risks to information systems they own or operate.In 2023, 
CISA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency made available $375 million through the 
State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program and $18 million through the Tribal Cybersecurity 
Grant Program.The Small Business Administration (SBA) also provides grant funding through 
the SBA Cybersecurity for Small Business Pilot Program.Federal agencies will continue to 
partner with SLTT entities and small businesses to share cybersecurity best practices, support 
cyber response and recovery, and accelerate cybersecurity research and development.Improving Incident Preparedness and ResponseThe Federal Government continues to prioritize providing support to victims of cyber incidents.
The Department of Justice (DOJ), FBI, CISA, U.S. Secret Service, and other Federal entities 
invest significant resources in helping victims after cyber incidents, including investigating 
cybercriminals to seek justice and prevent crime; employing a global network of cyber threat 
experts contributing to attribution and analysis; sharing cyber threat information to inform victim 
response actions; introducing targeted entities to decryption capabilities or other known 
mitigation tools; and assisting in freezing, seizing, and returning stolen and extorted funds.The FBIs Internet Crime Complaint Center Recovery Asset Team streamlines communications 
with financial institutions and FBI field offices to assist with freezing, seizing, and returning 
funds for victims and had a 71% success rate in 2023\.The FBI\-led Cryptocurrency Threat 
Center has worked with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to increase the 
U.S. Governments capability to publicly identify stolen cryptocurrency, including virtual assets 
stolen by DPRK\-linked actors. The FBIs Cyber Action Team and a growing number of Model 
Cyber Squads being developed across all 56 FBI field offices provide a rapid\-response capability 
that can be deployed within hours to provide investigative support in response to a major 
incident.CISA Hunt and Incident Response teams support organizations responding to cybersecurity 
incidents, including by identifying and detecting cyber threats to U.S. critical infrastructure.In 
2023, CISA regularly engaged with SRMAs to enhance collaboration with and support to critical 
infrastructure owners and operators.In addition, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law established a 
$100 million Cyber Response and Recovery Fund that CISA can use to support Federal, SLTT, 
public, and private sector entities in the event of a significant cyber incident.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
14 
In response to significant incidents and malicious cyber activity, Cybersecurity 
Advisories (CSA) provide critical infrastructure owners and operators and other entities with 
timely guidance to detect and respond to threats.Coordinating the development of these CSAs 
across the Federal Government and with international allies and partners improves support to 
victims.In May 2023, NSA, CISA, FBI, DOE, and international partners released a CSA 
detailing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the PRC\-sponsored Volt Typhoon 
actor, and later provided joint guidance for organizations to identify and mitigate these TTPs.The Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) reviews and assesses significant cyber incidents and 
makes recommendations for public and private sector organizations to prevent similar incidents 
from taking place.In August 2023, the CSRB released its analysis of the Lapsus$ threat actor 
group, highlighting the groups exploitation of systemic ecosystem weaknesses to victimize 
organizations across the country.This report led to subsequent, ongoing efforts by CISA and 
DHS to ensure that necessary security features are provided to customers without additional cost.
The CSRBs third report, released in April 2024, focuses on the malicious targeting of cloud 
computing environments and makes recommendations for strengthening identity management 
and authentication in the cloud.The structured analysis performed by the CSRB plays a crucial 
role in identifying and sharing lessons learned from significant cyber incidents and developing 
actionable mitigations.CISA is committed to updating the National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) by the end 
of 2024\.The NCIRP outlines our national approach to handling significant cyber incidents, 
including defining key roles and responsibilities for Federal agencies, private sector entities, and 
SLTT entities, in accordance with Presidential Policy Directive 41, United States Cyber Incident 
Coordination.The cyber threat landscape and the cyber defense ecosystem have evolved 
significantly since the NCIRP was originally published in 2016\.The updated NCIRP will 
provide a modern, agile, flexible framework to enable coordinated national incident response 
across the Federal Government, private sector, and other key partners.Disrupting and Degrading Adversary ActivityThe United States remains postured to use all instruments of national power to defend our 
interests in cyberspace and to disrupt and dismantle cyber threat actors.To counter ransomware 
and other forms of cybercrime, the Administration is pursuing new measures to improve the 
integrated use of diplomatic, information, military, financial, intelligence, and law enforcement 
capabilities, and to engage non\-Federal and international partners in these activities.Disruption 
alone cannot defeat ransomware or other forms of malicious cyber activity, but it can have a 
meaningful impact on the problem.In September 2023, the DoD finalized its 2023 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, which 
highlights the use of cyberspace operations through its policy of defending forward to actively 
disrupt malicious cyber activity before it can affect the United States and its interests.In March 
2024, DoD released the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Strategy to provide an actionable 
framework for sustaining a more resilient Joint Force and defense ecosystem.In 2023, U.S. 
Cyber Commands Cyber National Mission Force deployed 22 times to 17 countries to conduct 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES

partner\-enabled hunt forward operations that identify malicious cyber activity abroad and 
constrain adversaries freedom of maneuver.In October 2023, the White House\-led Counter\-Ransomware Initiative (CRI) convened its third 
summit to coordinate international efforts to defeat ransomware activity around the world.This 
year, the CRI focused its efforts on developing capabilities to disrupt ransomware attacks and 
infrastructure, improve information sharing, and fight back against the structural underpinnings 
of the ransomware ecosystem.To achieve these objectives, the CRI announced new 
commitments to establish intelligence sharing and operational collaboration platforms, build the 
cyber capacity of CRI members, and jointly issue the CRIs first\-ever policy statement that 
member governments should not pay ransoms.When the United States coordinates with allies and partners, takedowns and other disruption 
activities are more effective, impose more severe consequences on adversaries, and provide more 
impactful support to victims.These activities can also be paired with diplomatic actions, 
economic sanctions, and other tools tailored to impact malicious cyber actors.Allies and 
partners are also making significant contributions to the production of joint CSAs that attribute 
malicious cyber activity and provide important details on adversary TTPs.To enable additional 
information sharing and operational collaboration with foreign partners, the FBI has expanded its 
overseas presence of cyber assistant legal attaches by nearly 40%.The private sector also plays an important role in enhancing awareness of cyber threats across 
critical infrastructure through cyber threat intelligence sharing.Private sector organizations 
often have visibility into certain aspects of malicious activity that the Federal Government does 
not.The willingness of these organizations to share information directly with law enforcement 
or through NSAs CCC or CISAs JCDC strengthens the Federal Governments ability to assess 
and understand threats, devise mitigations, and facilitate victim notifications.The Federal Government is working to establish rules to prevent malicious actors from abusing 
U.Sbased cloud, AI, and other third\-party services.In January 2024, consistent with EO 14110 
on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence and EO 13984 
on Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency with Respect to Significant 
Malicious Cyber\-Enabled Activities, the Department of Commerce proposed a rule requiring 
U.S. Infrastructure\-as\-a\-Service providers to prevent the abuse of their products and services by 
foreign persons to enable malicious cyber activity.The Federal Government has increased the speed, scale, and impact of disruption campaigns to 
counter cybercriminal activity and dissuade adversaries from using cyber capabilities to achieve 
their malicious goals.The following campaigns illustrate the range of recent U.S. actions to 
disrupt malicious cyber activity affecting victims around the world: January 2023: DOJ announced a disruption campaign against the HIVE ransomware 
group, which had claimed over 1,500 victims in over 80 countries.The FBI and 
international partners penetrated HIVE networks, took its decryption keys, and made 
those keys available to victims.CISA, the FBI, and HHS disseminated HIVE indicators 
of compromise (IOCs) and TTPs through a joint CSA. 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
16 
 May 2023: DOJ announced an operation code\-named MEDUSA which disrupted a 
sophisticated global malware network called Snake.The operation disabled the malware 
on compromised computers using a tool created by the FBI.Simultaneously, the FBI, 
NSA, CISA, DoD Cyber National Mission Force, and international partners released a 
joint CSA attributing the malware to Russias Federal Security Service (FSB). July 2023: CISA announced the prevention of over 400 attempted ransomware 
operations since the beginning of the year.CISA disrupted these operations by passing to 
victims technical information paired with advice on how to best prevent further 
exploitation or harm. August 2023: DOJ announced a multinational operation which disrupted the Qakbot 
botnet and malware and took down its infrastructure.In 2023, cybercriminals used this 
infrastructure to commit ransomware, financial fraud, and other forms of criminal activity 
around the world.Dismantling this botnet involved gaining comprehensive access to 
compromised infrastructure and deploying a custom script to remove the malicious code 
from victim computers.FBI also seized $8\.6M in cryptocurrency in illicit profits.CISA 
and the FBI disseminated Qakbot infrastructure IOCs through a joint CSA. December 2023: DOJ announced a disruption campaign against the ALPHVBlackcat 
ransomware group, which had claimed over 1,000 victims around the world.At the time, 
ALPHVBlackcat was the worlds second\-most popular ransomware\-as\-a\-service variant, 
presenting would\-be cybercriminals with an easy\-to\-use toolset for executing extortion 
ransomware attacks.The FBI developed a decryption tool that enabled field offices and 
international partners to provide support to affected victims.CISA and the FBI 
disseminated ALPHVBlackcat IOCs and TTPs through a joint CSA. December 2023: DOJ announced that Anatoly Legkodymov, the founder and majority 
owner of Bitzlato Ltd a cryptocurrency exchange that served as a primary conduit for 
dark market purchasers and sellers, as well as a safe haven for illicit transactions by 
ransomware criminals, pleaded guilty to operating a money transmitting business that 
transmitted illicit funds. January 2024: DOJ announced a court\-authorized online operation that disrupted a 
botnet that PRC state\-sponsored actors used to conceal the hacking of U.S. and allied 
critical infrastructure.The PRC actors used a botnet comprised of small homesmall 
office (SOHO) routers to obfuscate their hacking of, and enduring surreptitious access to, 
U.S. critical infrastructure networks.FBI, CISA, and NSA issued several CSAs with 
detailed technical information about the PRC TTPs, allowing cybersecurity professionals 
to detect and prevent similar intrusions into their networks. February 2024: DOJ announced a disruption campaign, in coordination with other 
international law enforcement partners, of the LockBit ransomware group, which had 
claimed over 2,000 victims around the world.The United Kingdom, in cooperation with 
the FBI and other partners, also developed decryption capabilities for affected victims.
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
17 February 2024: DOJ announced an online operation to disrupt a botnet comprised of 
thousands of compromised SOHO routers operated by Russias military intelligence 
agency, the GRU.The GRU created this botnet by co\-opting criminal hackers earlier 
compromise of SOHO routers with Moobot malware and turning them into a global 
intelligence collection platform, primarily in support of spearphishing and similar 
credential harvesting campaigns, including operations targeting Ukraine.This takedown 
was the third time since Russias invasion of Ukraine that the United States stripped the 
Russian intelligence services of a key tool used to further Russias acts of aggression and 
other malicious activities.Defending Federal NetworksIn response to significant cyber incidents targeting Federal networks and critical infrastructure, 
EO 14028 marked a paradigm shift in the Federal Governments approach to cybersecurity by 
establishing baseline security measures across Federal systems.NSM\-8 further transformed 
accountability for the cybersecurity of our nations most critical systems by clarifying 
responsibilities for securing NSS.In addition, the Administration crafted a cybersecurity 
modernization agenda to invest in systems that support collective defense and created the first 
strategy to adopt Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) across the Federal civilian enterprise.In 2023, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act civilian agencies made progress implementing high\-
impact cybersecurity practices to improve their cybersecurity posture.These practices include 
progress on encrypting data both in transit and at rest, deployment of phishing\-resistant multi\-
factor authentication (MFA), deployment of end\-point detection and response (EDR) services, 
logging capabilities, and hiring skilled cybersecurity teams.By the first quarter of fiscal year 
2024, CFO Act civilian agencies demonstrated the following achievements as measured by 
quarterly Federal Information System Modernization Act metrics: Encryption: Progress was reported in encryption of data both at rest and in transit, with 
multiple CFO Act civilian agencies showing increases of more than 10%.
 MFA: There were improvements in the deployment of phishing\-resistant MFA across the 
vast majority of agencies, with ten agencies demonstrating an increase of at least 20% 
phishing\-resistant MFA deployment on agency systems.
 EDR: The average percentage of endpoints covered by at least one EDR platform 
reached 92%. 
 Logging: Five agencies achieved advanced logging capabilities for all High Value 
Assets.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and CISA stood up a working 
group to drive more effective log collection, which supports incident response activities. 
 Skilled Cybersecurity Team Hiring: Agencies continued to strengthen skilled 
cybersecurity team hiring, achieving an average position fill rate of 91%.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES

Defending Federal systems at speed and scale requires the government to advance an enterprise\-
level view of risk across departments and agencies.Through the adoption of shared services, 
agencies have bolstered their capabilities, reduced their attack surfaces, and improved visibility 
across Federal networks.In October 2023, OMB and ONCD convened an interagency working 
group that explored the deployment and use of cybersecurity shared services across the Federal 
Government, interviewed providers and customers, and identified gaps and challenges in getting 
shared services to small and micro agencies.CISA has equipped agencies with greater capabilities to identify, prioritize, and mitigate 
cybersecurity risks while enabling them to understand and manage critical threats through its 
Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program, which is aligned to government\-wide 
documents such as the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.In 2023, CISA helped enable 
the shift toward shared services by expanding its CDM program to all 23 civilian CFO Act 
agencies and 69 non\-CFO Act agencies, and by onboarding 97 agencies onto their Protective 
Domain Name System service.CISA, OMB, and ONCD have engaged with industry to determine the feasibility of providing 
enhanced logging capabilities to Federal civilian executive branch agencies.In February 2024, 
these engagements resulted in the rollout of expanded logs to all agencies and the extension of 
the default log retention period from 90 to 180 days.This major step forward is in line with 
CISAs Secure by Design guidance, which calls for technology providers to furnish high\-
quality audit logs to customers at no extra charge.The Director of NSA, as the National Manager for NSS, continues to enhance cyber coordination 
and alignment across over 70 Federal departments and agencies through greater centralized 
accountability, alignment of policy processes, and formalization of standards for NSS across 
Federal owners and operators.ONCD, in collaboration with interagency partners, developed a plan to drive improvements in 
Internet routing security, focusing on addressing vulnerabilities in the BGP.These 
vulnerabilities can be addressed by solutions such as Resource Public Key Infrastructure Route 
Origin Authorizations (RPKI ROA).The Federal Government has developed a Legacy 
Registration Services Agreement template for Federal agency use, and is developing a playbook 
to facilitate adoption of RPKI ROA.This solution removes a significant barrier to adoption and 
will facilitate government\-wide implementation of RPKI ROA.Efforts are also underway to improve collective operational defense so that breaches are isolated 
and remediated rapidly.CISAs Persistent Access Capability, made possible through the widely 
adopted EDR initiative born out of Executive Order 14028, facilitates real\-time threat 
intelligence sharing.The Federal Government's deliberate shift toward ZTA, the expansion of 
shared services, and the maturation of collective operational defense reflects a concerted effort to 
address the current cyber threat landscape and prepare for future challenges.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES

Strengthening the National Cyber WorkforceThe number of unfilled cyber jobs nationwide presents both a national security challenge and a 
tremendous economic opportunity, with public and private sector organizations pursuing a wide 
range of creative solutions.Released in July 2023, the National Cyber Workforce and Education 
Strategy (NCWES) prioritizes whole\-of\-government and whole\-of\-society approaches to address 
the immediate needs of the cyber workforce.The NCWES focuses on three guiding imperatives: 
(1\) leverage collaborative workforce development ecosystems to meet cyber workforce demands; 
(2\) enable the lifelong pursuit of cyber skills; and (3\) strengthen the cyber workforce through 
greater diversity and inclusion.Senior officials from across the Federal Government conducted strategic outreach engagements 
across the United States to gather perspectives from workers, educators, employers, and 
government leaders at local, state and Federal levels on cyber workforce matters.As of March 
2024, more than 90 organizations had made commitments in support of the NCWES, including 
hiring over 13,000 people in cyber jobs, dedicating over $280 million toward equipping 
Americans with foundational cyber skills, transforming cyber education, expanding the national 
cyber workforce, and strengthening the Federal cyber workforce.The NCWES makes clear that access to cyber education is necessary to meet our national cyber 
workforce needs in a sustainable manner.More than 440 colleges and universities designated by 
NSA as National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE\-C) deliver rigorous 
cybersecurity education to thousands of students each year.More than 100 of these NCAE\-C 
institutions participate in the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program led by the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) in collaboration with DHS and OPM. To prepare students in 
high school to enter these programs, Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs funded by 
the Department of Education are expanding their reach into middle schools with technical skill 
development as well as career advising and navigation.The GenCyber program, administered 
by NSA and funded through NSA and NSF, is developing the cyber skills of K\-12 teachers and 
students in informal summer camp learning environments.With consistent and dedicated 
Federal support, these efforts can continue to expand innovation in STEM education and provide 
a foundation for sustained development of the national cyber workforce.The NIST NICE program coordinates Federal Government cybersecurity education and 
workforce programs through the NICE Interagency Coordinating Council.NICE also promotes 
and energizes a community working together through the NICE Community Coordinating 
Council which includes working groups that implement the NICE Strategic Plan.NICE supports 
the ongoing development of CyberSeek.org which provides an interactive jobs heat map and a 
cooperative agreement for the U.S. Cyber Games resulting in the annual selection of the U.S. 
Cyber Team.Updated in March 2024, the NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity 
establishes a common lexicon that describes cybersecurity work and workers for the public and 
private sectors.Cyber workforce and education efforts are most effective when they align skill development
beginning in elementary school with career awareness, through career navigation in the middle 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
20 
grades, and technical skill preparation in high schoolwith progression into employment, higher 
education, entrepreneurship, or enlistment in the military.Examples of these programs include: Through the CHIPS and Science Act, NSFs Regional Innovation Engines program 
provides planning grants to grow Cyber Workforce ecosystems.In May 2023, NSF 
announced 44 Engines Development Awards spanning 46 U.S. states and territories, each 
funded at up to $1 million over two years to plan for a future NSF Engine. The annual NICE K\-12 Cybersecurity Education Conference and NICE K\-12 Community 
of Interest support the professional development of teachers and provide school 
administrators with the strategies and resources necessary to promote the discovery of 
cybersecurity careers. 
In April 2023, NIST awarded cooperative agreements to 18 Regional Alliances and 
Multistakeholder Partnerships Stimulating (RAMPS) cybersecurity education and 
workforce development program recipients in 15 different states, and in March 2023 
introduced a Notice of Funding Opportunity for 15 additional awards. These RAMPS 
Communities created an integrated ecosystem of cybersecurity education and workforce 
development to support local and regional economies. The Department of Education provides Career and Technical Education formula grants to 
states that can be used for cybersecurity skills development. The General Services Administration (GSA) operates the cross\-government U.S. Digital 
Corps (USDC) fellowship program. In 2023, USDC recruited 47 early career technology 
talents to the Federal Government, including nine Cybersecurity Fellows. DOE has multiple cyber workforce and education programs targeting the energy sector.
CyberForce is a collegiate cyber defense competition to test skills in team and individual 
competitions.The Operational Technology (OT) Defender Fellowship gives middle\- and 
senior\-level OT security managers in the energy sector the opportunity to learn about the 
strategies used to target energy infrastructure and the cybersecurity tools and tactics used 
to counter them.CyberStrike is a hands\-on ICS\-focused training that supports pipeline 
and re\-skilling workforce development efforts for energy sector owners and operators. In March 2024, DOE announced $15 million in funding to establish six university\-based 
electric power cybersecurity centers that will foster collaboration across the energy sector 
to address gaps in energy security research and provide cybersecurity education.Departments and agencies are also crafting workforce development approaches that meet their 
specific needs, recognizing that a diverse and varied set of pathways can provide the skills 
needed in the cyber workforce.For example, DoD released the DoD Cyber Workforce Strategy 
2023\-2027 and accompanying implementation plan to address how the Department will foster a 
skilled and diverse cyber workforce.OPM has developed a legislative proposal addressing 
government\-wide challenges and opportunities to strengthen and better compensate the Federal 
cyber workforce.

Advancing Software Security to Produce Safer Products and ServicesImproving software security will reduce systemic risk across the digital ecosystem.To seize this 
opportunity, the Federal Government has engaged with industry, academia, and civil society to 
promote Secure by Design principles and practices that shift the responsibility for security onto 
those organizations that are best positioned and most well\-resourced to mitigate risk.These 
actions lay the groundwork for possible legislation to establish liability for cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities in software products and services.In April 2023, CISA released Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and 
Approaches for Secure by Design, a guidance document developed with U.S. and international 
partners to provide organizations with concrete steps to implement Secure by Design principles.
In October 2023, CISA and its partners, including eight new international agency co\-sealers, 
published an update to the joint guidance to reflect feedback from hundreds of stakeholders.At 
the end of 2023, CISA also released its first Secure by Design alerts to provide guidance on 
secure software development practices and security defenses in technology products.In March 2024, CISA released the Secure Software Development Attestation Form, which will 
help ensure that the software producers who sell to the Federal Government leverage secure 
development techniques and toolsets.The form was drafted in consultation with OMB and 
based on practices established in the NIST Secure Software Development Framework.Software Bills of Material (SBOM) can enhance software supply chain risk management 
practices.In December 2023, NSA, ODNI, and CISA released a technical report containing 
guidance for industry on effective implementation of SBOM and the safe integration of open\-
source components into the software development lifecycle.That same month, NSA released 
Recommendations for Software Bills of Materials (SBOM) Management, which highlights best 
practices and provides recommendations for NSS to incorporate SBOM management functions 
suitable to their cybersecurity supply chain risk management needs.The adoption of memory safe programming languages enables the software development 
ecosystem to produce safer products and services.Memory safe programming languages can 
benefit both open\-source and proprietary software and eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities 
across the digital ecosystem.In December 2023, technical experts from CISA, NSA, FBI, and 
international partners released The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps, containing practical 
guidance for organizations seeking to adopt memory safe programming languages in their 
environments.In February 2024, ONCD released Back to the Building Blocks: A Path Toward 
Secure and Measurable Software to highlight memory safety and software measurability as two 
security challenges that the technical community can help solve.The Federal Government has made it a priority to support the open\-source developer community 
and enable the secure integration of open\-source components.The Open\-Source Software 
Security Initiative (OS3I) convenes public and private sector stakeholders to increase the security 
and resilience of the open\-source software landscape.In August 2023, ONCD sought public 
input on open\-source software security and memory safe programming languages.CISA also 
released an Open\-Source Software Security Roadmap to prioritize its work in this space.

Enabling a Digital Economy that Empowers and Protects ConsumersThe American public must be able to participate in a digital economy that is safe, fair, and 
accessible, and produces hardware and software that are reliably secure against cyber threats.
The Administration has pursued a range of market shaping tools to empower consumers, 
promote innovation, and incentivize cyber\-secure competition.In March 2024, the FCC approved the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, a voluntary cybersecurity 
certification and labeling program that will help Americans purchase smart devices that are safer 
and less vulnerable to cyberattacks.Under the program, IoT devices that meet certain 
cybersecurity criteria as determined by NIST, such as requiring unique and strong default 
passwords or securely implementing software updates, will be eligible for certification.Already, 
several leading consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers have committed to supporting 
implementation of the program.In July 2023, DOE announced a labeling research effort to 
address the feasibility and limitations of applying a labeling approach to OT like smart meters 
and solar inverters.The Administration has taken steps to ensure that Federal spending increases our collective 
cybersecurity and resilience.DoD, the General Services Administration (GSA), and NASA have 
proposed amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to standardize and improve 
cybersecurity requirements for unclassified Federal information systems, including prohibiting 
agencies from buying vulnerable IoT devices and requiring the use of SBOMs.Raising the 
cybersecurity standards of Federally\-procured technology products will incentivize cybersecurity 
across the ecosystem.Under the False Claims Act, the DOJs Civil Cyber\-Fraud Initiative holds government 
contractors accountable when they materially misrepresent the cybersecurity attributes of their 
products or services.In 2023, DOJ reached settlements with two vendors who had 
misrepresented that their products met cybersecurity controls tied to Federal contracts.At the end of 2023, the Treasury Department completed its initial assessment of the need for a 
Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events, finding that further exploration of the 
appropriate form of such a response is warranted and would be undertaken in the next phase of 
the assessment, in coordination with CISA and ONCD.CISA also announced the reconstitution 
of the Cybersecurity Insurance and Data Analysis Working Group to create a venue for 
government and industry stakeholders to exchange information and discuss the role of the 
insurance industry in driving down cyber risk.Investing in Resilient Next\-Generation TechnologiesEmbedding security and resilience into the technological foundations of our digital ecosystem is 
a cheaper and more efficient approach than attempting to bolt it on after the fact.In 2023, 
American innovation and public investment, powered by the Presidents Invest in America 
Agenda, created opportunities for coordinated public\-private efforts to optimize critical and 
emerging technologies for cybersecurity as they are developed and deployed.For example, in 
November 2023, DOE announced $70 million in funding through the Rural and Municipal 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
23 
Utility Advances Cybersecurity Grant and Technical Assistance BIL Program to enhance the 
cybersecurity posture of electric cooperative, municipal, and small investor\-owned utilities.This 
program helps these smaller utilities protect against, detect, respond to, and recover from 
cybersecurity threats, and increases their participation in cybersecurity threat information sharing 
programs.The ongoing clean energy transition presents opportunities to build in security and resilience 
across the foundations of our national infrastructure and clean energy supply chains.Through 
implementation of grant programs included in the BIL and IRA, DOE and other Federal partners 
are enabling grant recipients to procure and implement safer clean energy technologies.The BIL 
also requires that certain projects funded under the law include a cybersecurity plan to maintain 
or improve the projects cybersecurity over its lifecycle.In July 2023, DOE funded eight innovative small businesses that are advancing cybersecurity for 
distributed energy resources (DERs) and in September announced $39 million of funding for 
nine new National Laboratory projects to advance the cybersecurity of DERs.Also in 
September 2023, the DOE Clean Energy Cybersecurity Accelerator graduated its inaugural 
cohort, focusing on enabling technologies that offer authentication and authorization solutions 
for industrial control systems.DOE further released an implementation guide for its National 
Cyber\-Informed Engineering Strategy to assist organizations in building cybersecurity into the 
design of energy infrastructure.In January 2024, DOE also announced a $30 million funding 
opportunity to support research, development, and demonstration (RD\&D) of next generation 
tools to protect clean energy delivery infrastructure from cyberattacks.The Federal Government is funding RD\&D in cutting\-edge cybersecurity and resilience 
technologies.The 2023 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan aligns 
to the NCS and provides Federal agencies with specific guidance on priorities for Federal 
funding, including human\-centered cybersecurity, trustworthiness, cyber resilience, metrics, and 
RD\&D infrastructure.The plan also aligns with an August 2023 joint OMB\-OSTP memo 
outlining multi\-agency research and development priorities for the fiscal year 2025 budget, 
including critical and emerging technology and innovation that can mitigate cybersecurity risk.
Through its Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace program, the NSF is funding research projects 
focusing on critical infrastructure security and resilience.The Administration is coordinating public and private actions to secure longstanding 
vulnerabilities in the underlying technical foundations of the Internet.Making the BGP more 
secure can significantly reduce harm resulting from unsecured Internet routing.In July 2023, the 
FCC and CISA convened Federal partners, nonprofits, and industry partners, including Internet 
service providers and cloud content providers, to develop a common understanding of the latest 
BGP security improvements and coordinate efforts to accelerate them.In October 2023, the President signed EO 14110 on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy 
Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence to direct whole\-of\-government efforts to shape 
the values\-aligned development of AI.EO 14110 addresses the various ways by which AI may 
impact the cybersecurity community.First, to explore ways to use AI to enable more efficient 
cyber defense activities, EO 14110 establishes an advanced cybersecurity program to develop AI 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
24 
tools to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical software.Second, to mitigate the potential risks 
posed by AI to our critical infrastructure, EO 14110 directs DHS to establish an AI Safety and 
Security Board and, based on NISTs AI Risk Management Framework, provide safety and 
security guidelines to critical infrastructure owners and operators.Third, to protect the AI 
ecosystem against cyber threats, developers of certain AI models will be required to report to the 
Department of Commerce their capabilities for defending against sophisticated threat actors.The Federal Government continues to engage with a wide range of stakeholders to prepare for a 
post\-quantum future.In August 2023, NIST submitted for public comment three draft Federal 
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) designed to resist future attacks by cryptanalytically\-
relevant quantum computers.To support non\-Federal cryptographic transitions, OMB, CISA, 
NIST, and NSA published resources for organizations to develop and implement their own 
Quantum\-Readiness Roadmaps.NIST, NSA, and partners are working across multiple standards 
developing organizations to integrate the expected NIST post\-quantum cryptographic standard in 
a wide variety of security standards.NIST also continues to engage with a working group of 
industry, academic, and government stakeholders to identify and address the challenges related 
to cryptographic transitions at the NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.Managing Risks to Data Security and PrivacyIn the absence of a national data privacy law, the Administration is pursuing targeted measures to 
protect Americans data and their privacy, and enable safe, data\-rich cross\-border commerce.
EO 14117 on Preventing Access to Americans Bulk Sensitive Personal Data and United States 
Government\-Related Data by Countries of Concern authorizes the Attorney General to prevent 
the large\-scale transfer of Americans personal data to countries of concern and provides 
safeguards around other activities that can give those countries access to Americans sensitive 
data.The protections authorized by EO 14117 will extend to genomic data, biometric data, 
personal health data, geolocation data, financial data, and certain kinds of personal identifiers 
that adversaries may exploit for a variety of nefarious purposes, including to engage in malicious 
cyber\-enabled activities.The EU\-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, finalized in July 2023, is a leading example of the 
international partnership required for safe and trusted cross\-border data flows.Alongside the 
frameworks finalization, the Department of Commerce released the Data Privacy Framework 
program website for companies participating in cross\-border data transfers.EO 14110 on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, 
reinforces the importance of mitigating privacy risks in emerging technologies.EO 14110 
directs departments and agencies to take steps to safeguard Americans privacy in the 
development and deployment of AI.In December 2023, NIST issued draft guidance for agencies 
on evaluating differential\-privacy\-guarantee protections.In February 2024, DOE and NSF 
established a Research Coordination Network to advance research, development, and 
implementation of privacy\-enhancing technologies (PETs).PETs are an important part of the Administrations affirmative vision for a secure, trustworthy, 
and rights\-respecting digital ecosystem.To coordinate Federal efforts to harness PETs, the 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
25 
Administration released the National Strategy to Advance Privacy\-Preserving Data Sharing and 
Analytics in March 2023\.The strategy provides a roadmap for research, development, and 
adoption of PETs in a manner that will help tackle shared challenges such as healthcare, climate 
change, financial crime, human trafficking, and pandemic response.The United States has also 
engaged with international partners and academia stakeholders through the PETs Prize 
Challenge, which announced winners at the Summit for Democracy in March 2023\.Enhancing Security and Resilience Across the GlobeCyberspace is a global domain, and the United States works hand\-in\-hand with allies and 
partners to defend against common cyber threats and build shared resilience.This approach to 
collective defense is rooted in both increasingly integrated operational capabilities and deepening 
strategic alignment.Over the past year, Federal departments and agencies signed new 
arrangements to strengthen bilateral cooperation with a wide range of foreign partners, including 
Finland, the Republic of Korea, and Jordan.Throughout 2023, the United States responded to our partners and allies in times of crisis, 
supporting countries such as Costa Rica and Albania with funding, resources, and technical 
expertise to help them recover from cyberattacks.Recent incidents have shown the need for both 
immediate incident response resources and longer\-term technical support to develop more secure 
and resilient cyber ecosystems.The Administration continues to expand flexible and innovative pathways for building partner 
cyber capacity.A new Cyberspace, Digital Connectivity, and Related Technologies Fund, 
established with support from Congress, recognizes the need for sustained funding mechanisms 
able to scale to meet our partners needs in and out of conflict.This instrument, once fully 
funded, enables the State Department to provide foreign assistance through flexible, robust, and 
responsive cyber, digital, and emerging technology programs that can be delivered quickly in 
order to respond to fast moving threats and opportunities.The Administration also collaborates with allies, partners, and the private sector to build cyber 
capacity.For example, in December 2023, the Tallinn Mechanism was officially formalized 
between the United States, Ukraine, and nine other partners as a means to coordinate and 
facilitate civilian cyber capacity building in support of Ukraine.The Tallinn Mechanism 
systematizes the assistance and contributions from both governments and the private sector to 
reinforce Ukraines long\-term cyber resilience and preparedness.The United States has used regional coalitionssuch as the Organization of American States 
(OAS), Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS), and Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) to build cybersecurity capacity as the demand for cybersecurity 
assistance grows in both scope and scale.In September 2023, DHS hosted the first Western 
Hemisphere Cyber Conference, which convened cyber leaders from 21 foreign governments to 
discuss cybersecurity challenges and identify areas of collaboration.To support global, 
multistakeholder efforts on sustainable cyber capacity building, the U.S. endorsed the Accra Call 
for Cyber Resilient Development: An Action Framework.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES
26 
In May 2024, the State Department released the International Cyberspace and Digital Policy 
Strategy to lay out the Administrations affirmative vision for digital solidarity, multilateral 
engagement, coalition building, and strengthening international cyber capacity.A key element 
of this strategy is working with allies and partners to secure the digital ecosystem so that 
technologies being designed and deployed today are secure against the threats of tomorrow.The Administration is prioritizing research and development, standards development, and supply 
chain security and diversification for technologies such as 5G and 6G, cloud infrastructure and 
data centers, semiconductors, undersea cables, and satellite communications. The State 
Departments International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) Fund provides 
$100 million per year over five years to diversify the global semiconductor supply chain, 
promote secure ICT connectivity, provide agile response programs, and protect Americans 
sensitive data from foreign adversaries.The State Department is also strengthening its own 
expertise and capacity domestically and overseas with expanded training programs and will field 
a trained cyber\-digital policy officer at every mission engaging on these issues by the end of 
2024\.Advancing a Rights\-Respecting Digital EcosystemThe United States is working with like\-minded allies and partners to ensure that the digital world 
reflects and reinforces our shared democratic values.Countries around the world are seeking to 
advance an affirmative, human rights\-respecting vision of technologys benefits, while 
simultaneously working to counter the misuse of technology and the rise of digital 
authoritarianism.To meet this challenge, the 2023 and 2024 Summits for Democracy highlighted the commitment 
of the United States and over 70 countries to advancing an affirmative vision of an open, free, 
global, interoperable, reliable, accessible, and secure Internet; combatting the proliferation and 
misuse of digital technologies like commercial spyware; and shaping emerging technologies to 
align with democratic values and human rights.Many of those countries work alongside the 
United States to support Internet freedom and protect human rights worldwide through the 
Freedom Online Coalition.In 2023, the United States assumed the chair of the Freedom Online 
Coalition and strengthened the coalitions work to shape the standards and norms that underpin 
Internet freedom.CISA launched the High Risk Community Protection Initiative to partner with communities who 
are at heightened risk of advanced persistent threat targeting and have limited capacity to provide 
for their own defense.CISA has partnered with civil society organizations and technology 
companies to develop resources which advance the cybersecurity of civil society.Through the 
Strategic Dialogue on Cybersecurity of Civil Society Under Threat of Transnational Repression, 
CISA has worked with stakeholders in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Denmark, 
Estonia, France, Japan, New Zealand, and Norway to advance global efforts to strengthen the 
cybersecurity of civil society and improve its resilience to transnational repression.The Administration has mobilized a government\-wide effort to counter the proliferation and 
misuse of commercial spyware, one of the most intrusive forms of digital repression.Issued in 
2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES

March 2023, EO 14093 on Prohibition on Use by the United States Government of Commercial 
Spyware that Poses Risks to National Security restricts the U.S. Governments operational use of 
commercial spyware that poses risks to national security or poses significant risks of improper 
use by a foreign government or foreign person.EO 14093 was the first step in a broader 
campaign to counter the threat posed by the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, 
including through: (1\) diplomatic engagement, primarily through a coalition of 17 like\-minded 
partners endorsing the U.Sled Joint Statement on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and 
Misuse of Commercial Spyware and the Guiding Principles on Government Use of Surveillance 
Technologies; (2\) continued use of Department of Commerce export controls on specific 
commercial spyware vendors; (3\) a new State Department visa ban policy targeting those who 
misuse commercial spyware or benefit from its misuse; and (4\) Treasury Department sanctions 
against commercial spyware vendors and their leadership.The Administration seeks not only to mitigate the harms of existing vulnerabilities in our digital 
ecosystem, but also to promote our values through international cyber norms.The United States 
is committed to promoting the United Nations (UN) framework for responsible state behavior in 
cyberspace, making progress on confidence building measures, and upholding norms through the 
UN Open\-Ended Working Group.The United States also continues to promote the 
establishment of the permanent UN Cyber Programme of Action (POA) to advance the UN 
framework, with 161 governments voting to support the creation of such a mechanism in the 
General Assembly.The United States will continue to work with allies, partners, and organizations such as the U.S\- 
EU Trade and Technology Council and International Telecommunication Union to shape 
technology standards in alignment with U.S. values.In May 2023, the Administration also 
published the first ever National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology which 
puts forward an affirmative vision of standards that embrace transparency, openness, impartiality 
and consensus, effectiveness and relevance, coherence, and broad participation.2 0 2 4R EPOR TO NT H EC YBERSECURIT YP OSTUREO FT H EU NITE DS TATES

Future OutlookThe 2024 Report on the Cybersecurity Posture of the United States highlights the breadth and 
depth of cybersecurity initiatives taking place across the Federal Government to realize the 
NCSs vision of a digital ecosystem that is defensible, resilient, and aligned with our values.
While the strategic environment will continue to evolve, presenting new technological and 
governance challenges as well as opportunities, many of the current programs will continue to 
endure over the coming years.Each step taken toward the Administrations affirmative vision 
will strengthen our cybersecurity posture and build economic prosperity for communities across 
the country.Along with continued implementation of the Federal Governments current efforts, there are 
several efforts that will require a specific focus in the coming year.Each of these have resources 
aligned to them in the fiscal year 2025 Presidents Budget request. Federal agencies with designated responsibilities as an SRMA must continue to enhance 
their efforts, consistent with U.S. critical infrastructure security and resilience policy and 
the Homeland Security Act, to enable operational collaboration within their sectors and 
provide specialized expertise to critical infrastructure owners and operators. Departments and agencies will continue to implement the NCWES at scale through a 
diverse array of programs and authorities to strengthen the national cyber workforce, 
improve cyber education, and address unique challenges facing the Federal cyber 
workforce. Implementation of CIRCIA will establish new requirements for covered entities across all 
critical infrastructure sectors to report certain cybersecurity incidents to the Federal 
Government.The information contained in these reports will provide new visibility into 
malicious cyber activity and ransomware, improve our understanding of cross\-sectoral 
risks, and strengthen our collective defense.CISA and other departments and agencies 
with CIRCIA responsibilities are preparing to receive, process, share, and respond to 
these new incident reports. In 2023, DOJ established a new National Security Cyber Section to increase the 
Departments capacity to disrupt and respond to malicious cyber activity.The Section 
will promote Department\-wide, intragovernmental, foreign, and private sector 
partnerships to tackle increasingly sophisticated and aggressive cyber threats by nation\-
state adversaries and their proxies. To create a common operating landscape for cybersecurity, CISA is developing a new 
Cyber Analytics and Data System.This infrastructure will be used to integrate 
cybersecurity data sets; provide internal tools and capabilities to facilitate the ingestion 
and integration of data; and orchestrate and automate the analysis of data to support the 
rapid identification, detection, mitigation, and prevention of malicious cyber activity.

The Federal Government continues to plan the transition of vulnerable public networks
and systems to quantum\-resistant cryptography, consistent with NSM\-10 on Promoting
United States Leadership in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable
Cryptographic Systems.In 2023, Federal departments and agencies undertook the first
inventory of Federal cryptographic systems which may contain vulnerable encryption
algorithms and developed cost estimates for quantum\-resistant cryptography migration.
These inventories and cost estimates will inform future planning for migration activities.
NCSIP Version 2 builds on the successes of 2023 and creates a blueprint for resource alignment.
ONCD is committed to maintaining the transparency of the implementation process and 
ensuring Federal coherence, and the NCSIP will continue to be updated annually to reflect work 
completed and identify measures required to meet the new demands of the dynamic cyber threat 
landscape.
