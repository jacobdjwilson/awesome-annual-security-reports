In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity,
this year’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook provides
crucial insights into the multifaceted challenges
facing leaders across the globe. Geopolitical
instability, rapidly advancing technologies and an
increasing gap in organizational cyber capabilities
reinforce the need to build resilience and enable
systemic global collaboration.

Building on the priorities outlined in last year’s
report, the World Economic Forum’s Centre for
Cybersecurity remains committed to bridging the
gaps between the public and private sectors and
between cyber and business leaders. The report
serves as an instrument to distil cyber-risk issues into
achievable insights tailored to today’s executives.

While there is a notable sense of optimism
stemming from increased executive-level awareness
of the cybersecurity ecosystem and its risks, the
report also underscores a growing cyber divide.

Organizations demonstrating cyber resilience
are increasingly distinct from those grappling
with cybersecurity challenges. The dialogue
between cyber and business executives has
shown improvement, yet significant disparities
persist among industries, countries and sectors,
demanding continued attention and collaboration.

Looking ahead to the challenges of 2024, the report
illuminates major findings and puts a spotlight
on the widening cyber inequity and the profound
impact of emerging technologies. The path forward
demands strategic thinking, concerted action and a
steadfast commitment to cyber resilience.

This report invites leaders not only to recognize
the hurdles but also to actively embrace the
opportunities for positive change. It is a call for
collective effort and innovation, urging leaders to
work collaboratively towards a more secure, resilient
and trustworthy digital future.

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024

## Executive summary

Looming cyber inequity amid a rapidly evolving
tech landscape emphasizes the need for even
greater public-private cooperation.

In 2023 the world faced a polarized geopolitical
order, multiple armed conflicts, both scepticism and
fervour about the implications of future technologies,
and global economic uncertainty. Amid this complex
landscape, the cybersecurity economy^1 grew
exponentially faster than the overall global economy,
and outpaced growth in the tech sector.^2 However,
many organizations and countries experienced that
growth in exceptionally different ways.

A stark divide between cyber-resilient organizations
and those that are struggling has emerged. This
clear divergence in cyber equity is exacerbated
by the contours of the threat landscape,
macroeconomic trends, industry regulation and early
adoption of paradigm-shifting technology by some
organizations. Other clear barriers, including the
rising cost of access to innovative cyber services,
tools, skills and expertise, continue to influence
the ability of the global ecosystem to build a more
secure cyberspace in the face of myriad transitions.

These factors are also ever-present in the
accelerated disappearance of a healthy “middle
grouping” of organizations (i.e. those that maintain
minimum standards of cyber resilience only). Despite
this divide, many organizations indicate clear
progress in certain aspects of their cyber capability.
This year’s outlook also finds cause for optimism,
especially when considering the relationship
between cyber and business executives.

These are the major findings from this year’s Global
Cybersecurity Outlook and the key cyber trends
that executives will need to navigate in 2024:

*   **There is growing cyber inequity**
    **between organizations that are**
    **cyber resilient and those that**
    **are not.**
    In parallel, the population of organizations that
    maintain a minimum level of cyber resilience is
    disappearing. Small and medium enterprises
    (SMEs),^3 despite making up the majority of many
    country’s ecosystems, are being disproportionately
    affected by this disparity.
    While large organizations demonstrated
    remarkable gains in cyber resilience, SMEs
    showed a significant decline.
    *   More than twice as many SMEs as the largest
        organizations say they lack the cyber resilience
        to meet their critical operational requirements.
    *   90% of the 120 executives surveyed at the
        World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting on
        Cybersecurity said that urgent action is required
        to address this growing cyber inequity.

*   **Emerging technology will**
    **exacerbate long-standing**
    **challenges related to cyber**
    **resilience.**
    This will in turn accelerate the divide between the
    most capable and the least capable organizations.
    *   As organizations race to adopt new technologies,
        such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), a
        basic understanding is needed of the immediate,
        mid-term and long-term implications of these
        technologies for their cyber-resilience posture.
    *   Fewer than one in 10 respondents believe that
        in the next two years generative AI will give the
        advantage to defenders over attackers.
    *   Approximately half of executives say that
        advances in adversarial capabilities (phishing,
        malware, deepfakes) present the most
        concerning impact of generative AI on cyber.

*   **The cyber-skills and talent**
    **shortage continues to widen**
    **at an alarming rate.**
    *   Half of the smallest organizations by revenue
        say they either do not have or are unsure as to
        whether they have the skills they need to meet
        their cyber objectives.
    *   Only 15% of all organizations are optimistic
        that cyber skills and education will significantly
        improve in the next two years.
    *   The number of organizations that maintain
        minimum viable cyber resilience is down 30%.
    *   52% of public organizations state that a lack of
        resources and skills is their biggest challenge
        when designing for cyber resilience.

*   **Alignment between cyber**
    **and business is becoming**
    **more common.**
    Organizations (including both business and cyber
    leaders)^4 must continue to invest in and maintain an
    awareness of essential security fundamentals.
    *   29% of organizations reported that they had
        been materially affected by a cyber incident in
        the past 12 months.
    *   The largest organizations say that the highest
        barrier to cyber resilience is transforming legacy
        technology and processes.
    *   There is a clear link between cyber resilience
        and CEO engagement. This year, 93% of
        respondents that consider their organizations
        to be leaders and innovators in cyber resilience
        trust their CEO to speak externally about their
        cyber risk. Of organizations that are not cyber
        resilient, only 23% trust their CEO’s ability to
        speak about their cyber risk.

*   **Cyber ecosystem risk is**
    **becoming more problematic.**
    For any organization, the partners in its ecosystem
    are both the greatest asset and the biggest
    hindrance to a secure, resilient and trustworthy
    digital future.
    *   41% of the organizations that suffered a material
        incident in the past 12 months say it was
        caused by a third party.
    *   54% of organizations have an insufficient
        understanding of cyber vulnerabilities in their
        supply chain. Even 64% of executives who
        believe that their organization’s cyber resilience
        meets its minimum requirements to operate say
        they still have an inadequate understanding of
        their supply-chain cyber vulnerabilities.
    *   60% of executives agree that cyber and privacy
        regulations effectively reduce risk in their
        organization’s ecosystem – up 21% since 2022.

## 1 Understanding global
cyber inequity

A systemic solution is needed to address
the inequity in cyber-resilience capacity
across organizations and countries.

![Image of a globe with interconnected lines]

### 1.1 The state of cyber inequity

In 2022, the cybersecurity economy^5 grew
twice as fast as the world economy.^6 In 2023, it
grew four times faster. Although organizational
investment in cyber resilience overall is on the rise,
rapid innovation and growth often lead to uneven
development.

This unevenness creates major economic and
social benefits for some; generally, the largest and
most developed economies reap the rewards of
new technologies, while less developed nations,
sectors and communities continue to fall behind.
In this case, rapid technological growth, although
benefiting many in terms of access, innovation and
even collaboration, is also creating systemic inequity
in the global cybersecurity economy and belies a
pronounced disparity between the cyber-resilience
capability of organizations that make up its markets.

The 2024 Global Cybersecurity Outlook (GCO) finds
that organizations that maintain minimum viable
cyber resilience – that is, a healthy middle grouping
of organizations – are disappearing. Organizations
reporting such a minimum viable cyber resilience
are down 31% since 2022. The distance between
organizations that are cyber resilient enough to
thrive and those that are fighting to survive is
widening at an alarming rate. As a result, the least
capable organizations are perpetually unable to
keep up with the curve, falling further behind and
threatening the integrity of the entire ecosystem.
The cost of accessing adequate cyber services,
tools and talent, and the early adoption of cutting-
edge technology by the largest organizations in the
ecosystem are two core factors driving the divide.

A few statistics further illustrate the trend towards
imbalance. The smallest organizations are more
than twice as likely as the largest to say they
lack the cyber resilience they need to meet their
minimum critical operational requirements.^7 At
the other end of the spectrum, the highest-revenue
organizations are 22% more confident than the
smallest organizations that their cyber resilience
exceeds their operational needs. And yet the
smallest-revenue organizations are also a troubling
three times more likely to lack the cyber skills they
need to meet their cyber-resilience objectives.

This phenomenon is particularly alarming in light of
the interconnected nature of the cyber ecosystem.
One of the core measurements of cyber resilience
is an understanding of your ecosystem, inclusive of
assessments of supply-chain and third-party risk.
For those large organizations reporting that they are
leaders in cyber resilience, the emergence of this
drastic drop in cyber resilience of small organizations
should be especially alarming. Consider a 2023
report from SecurityScorecard and the Cyentia
Institute, which found that “98% of organizations
have a relationship with at least one third party that
has experienced a breach in the last two years”.^8
This type of entanglement should be reason enough
for those that are most cyber resilient to proactively
help organizations in their ecosystem to move
towards a healthier cyber posture.

Several other factors may unduly influence and
exacerbate the vulnerabilities of those SMEs in
this widening disparity. Among small organizations
– which are often unable to prevent critical
operational disruption from an incident and can
incur disproportionate financial loss to recover –
only 25% carry cyber insurance. That’s three times
less likely than the largest organizations by revenue,
which report a 75% cyber-insurance adoption rate.
The results are also consistent for organization
size by employee count. The more employees
within an organization, the higher the adoption
rate of cyber insurance; 85% of organizations
with more than 100,000 employees carry cyber
insurance, while only 21% of organizations with 250
employees or fewer have a policy. As the prices of
cyber insurance continue to rise exponentially, the
expectation is that this gap will widen in parallel,
leaving smaller organizations with even fewer
options to reduce their risk.

![Figure 3: Organizations that carry cyber insurance by number of employees]

![Figure 4: Organizations that carry cyber insurance by revenue]

Globally, disparity across geographies is also
reflected in the analysis. Perhaps unsurprisingly,
this global cyber gap tends to mirror other global
development indicators. The lowest number of
self-reported cyber-resilient organizations are
in Latin America and Africa, while the highest
number come from North America and Europe.
Similarly, Latin America and Africa reported the
highest number of insufficiently cyber-resilient
organizations, while North America and Europe
reported the lowest number.

This phenomenon, sometimes characterized as
the “cybersecurity poverty line (CPL)”, generally
refers to the prohibitive cost of securing robust
cybersecurity for an organization’s personnel,
technology and systems. But this divide goes far
beyond prohibitive costs. Consider the cyber-
skills gap, a well-documented issue for even the
largest global organizations. Other factors, such as
knowledgeable leaders, the ability to understand
shifting best practices, and access to highly
innovative technologies, also dramatically affect
an organization’s ability to stay ahead of the curve.
As the Atlantic Council puts it, “Cyber poverty
exhibits dynamics very similar to real-world poverty:
simply providing money or free expertise does not
necessarily address poor technological designs,
poor market incentives, misaligned sociocultural
attitudes towards security, or other barriers.”^9

The disparity may be ultra-visible now, but it has
been developing for years, and the cyber-resilience
inequity trend has been steadily increasing over time.
Among the lowest-revenue organizations, lack of
sufficient cyber resilience is up a troubling 32% since
2022. Among the highest-revenue organizations,
reported deficiencies in cyber resilience are similar to
those reported two years ago.

Additionally, the number of organizations with lower
revenue that reported their cyber resilience exceeds
their operational requirements has not increased
over the past two years. Conversely, among large-
revenue organizations, cyber confidence rose 32%.

Although there are generalized economic norms
indicating that this is healthy competition, cyber
leaders know that the digital ecosystem is so
intertwined and fragile that to continue on this
trajectory is more harmful than healthy.

When asked to comment on this disappearing
middle grouping of organizations, Rotem Iram,
Chief Executive Officer of At-Bay, neatly summed it
up in this way:

> Security solutions are becoming too sophisticated, to the point
> where many SMEs struggle to operate them, let alone afford them.

### 1.2 Core drivers of cyber inequity

Organizations of all sizes and maturity levels
have often struggled to maintain central tenets of
organizational cyber resilience. Historically, however,
several factors began to stratify the cyber capability
of both public- and private-sector organizations.
Some organizations prioritized resilience,
incorporated it into corporate culture and invested
accordingly, while others did not. Some sectors
more strictly regulated their members – for example,
out of concern for human safety or national security,
to safeguard personally protected information,
or to protect the global financial system. Other
organizations were forced to contend with a more
hostile threat landscape and suffered a significant,
often public incident.

Over time, differences in organizational, sectoral and
country-specific circumstances, as well as varied
responses to universal cyber challenges, separated
the market into clear leaders and stragglers. Add to
the equation the pace of the rising cost of access to
adequate cybersecurity capability and what results
is the current state of cyber inequity between small
and large organizations, between the public and
private sectors, and among organizations operating
in different economies around the world.

The digital divide in access to the internet provides
a useful parallel. Consider the comment from Angel
Gonzalez Sanz, Head of Science, Technology and
Innovation in the Division on Technology and Logistics
of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), that, “although 63% of
the world’s population is connected to the internet;
least developed countries still only count 27% of
their populations as internet users”.^10 The digital
ecosystem is so highly interconnected and influenced
by geopolitics, economics and the rapid emergence
of new technology that no entity can afford to be
perpetually trapped under the capability curve, least of
all the organizations that are already the most at risk.

As Abhay Raman, Senior Vice-President and Chief
Security Officer at Sun Life, put it:

> Affordability is a critical determinant of cyber-resilience success.
> We should therefore design risk-appropriate, affordable and
> fit-for-use cyber-resilience architectures for large multinationals
> and SMEs alike.

The risks associated with continuing to
exacerbate this technological divide between
organizations and nations that can and cannot
adequately mitigate cyber events poses both
a threat to the entire ecosystem and outsized
risks to those that are already vulnerable. The
imbalance in global internet access presents
a prescient example of the consequences of
sustaining an unequal digital ecosystem.

Doing so requires a systemic solution, with
participation from everyone – SMEs, multinational
corporations (MNCs), non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and governmental

organizations. Fortunately, cyber executives
agree: 90% of the 120 executives surveyed at
the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting on
Cybersecurity said that urgent action is required
to address this growing cyber inequity. There is
evidence of an appetite for systemic collaboration
that supports SMEs. For example, in 2020, the
World Economic Forum brought together partners
from telecommunication companies, civil society
and cyber organizations to publish cybercrime
prevention principles for internet services providers.^11
This is an example of systemically important actors
such as internet service providers working to protect
the entire ecosystem, including smaller players.

## 2 A world in geopolitical
and technological
transition

The rapid spread of generative AI and
other new technologies that can easily be
used by cyberattackers poses a serious
threat both for business and in public life.

![Image of a stylized world map with digital elements]

### 2.1 Geopolitical tensions and cyber

Geopolitics has
at least moderately
influenced

70%

of organizations’
cybersecurity
strategies.

In this year’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook survey,
70% of leaders stated that geopolitics has at
least moderately influenced their organization’s
cybersecurity strategy. The influence of geopolitics
has remained as persistently top of mind as it was
last year, with 74% of respondents from the 2023
report stating the same. This year, 32% of 37 CISOs
surveyed separately said they are adjusting their
cybersecurity strategy by increasing the use of
threat intelligence reports and further developing
their incident response plans. Increasingly alarming
attacks against critical infrastructure, and elements
in global supply chains, coupled with economic
instability, have the potential to cause macro-impact.

Geopolitics also directly influences how quickly
the risk landscape can shift for an organization
or country. Some 72% of leaders report that they
understand this rapidly shifting landscape and are
actively integrating current events into how they
manage their cyber risks.

Just as cybersecurity breaches weaken our faith in
the systems that underpin economies and societies,
other technological risks, such as disinformation,
can do the same. Often the same defenders are
called upon to help combat both. A key example of
this is how public- and private-sector organizations
alike are reevaluating both the vulnerabilities
of specific institutions and processes, such as
elections, in the face of intense geopolitical strife,
and increased technological capability.

An example of the intersection of geopolitical
turmoil and artificial intelligence, deepfakes
and sophisticated phishing campaigns have
the potential to become weaponized to disrupt
democratic election procedures. Although
information warfare is not a new concept, the
decentralization of information sources, and the
rapid advance of technology, makes defending
against these types of malicious threats a key
concern in the coming year and beyond.

Looking ahead to 2024, these risks will compound
to take centre stage. More than 45 countries will
hold elections over the next year to determine
who governs more than 50% of the world’s GDP.^12
With the proliferation of new technologies such as
generative AI and their use by cyber adversaries
becoming more widespread, safeguarding the
integrity and fairness of the electoral process
becomes of paramount importance.

In Slovakia’s September 2023 elections, for instance,
a deepfake audio clip was released that purported to
show a candidate discussing how to manipulate the
election with a media representative.^13

Artificial intelligence advances pose more risks than
deepfakes or misinformation. To understand the
intersection of cyber and election security,^14 there
are six areas of risk that should be noted as next
year’s elections unfold.

*   **Misinformation and disinformation**: organized
    campaigns spreading misinformation through
    social media or other channels can influence
    public opinion, cast doubt on election integrity
    and sway election outcomes.
*   **Deepfakes**: in this specific species of
    disinformation, AI-generated deepfake videos
    or audio recordings can be used to spread false
    information about candidates or manipulate
    public perception.
*   **Automated disinformation**: AI algorithms can
    be employed to generate and spread large
    volumes of disinformation, making it harder to
    detect and combat.
*   **Targeted advertising**: AI-driven microtargeting
    of mis- or disinformation of voters through
    personalized advertisements can be used to
    manipulate opinions or suppress voter turnout.
*   **Data privacy concerns**: where voting
    information is drawn from national ID, residence
    records or other methods that connect
    to personally identifiable information (PII),
    automated processing may create avenues for
    the leakage of personal data not relevant to
    voting eligibility determinations.
*   **Algorithmic manipulation of social media**:
    AI algorithms on social media platforms can
    be manipulated to amplify certain political
    messages or suppress others, influencing
    public opinion.

It is worth noting that while generative AI will add to
the complexity of attacks, it is not the only concern
in relation to the rise in cybercriminal activity due
to geopolitical tensions. Over the past five years,
the number of malware families^15 and variants that
have infiltrated at least 10% of global organizations
has doubled.^16

Cyberthreats to the electoral process are just
one example of how the confluence of emerging
tech, cyber and geopolitics might demand global
attention in the coming year. A collaborative
approach ensures a multipronged defence strategy,
fortifying the overall resilience of election systems
against a diverse spectrum of cyberthreats.

### 2.2 New technology, same fear

Emerging technology is becoming available more
widely and far faster than in the past. This rapid
uptake of technologies has outpaced the ability
of civil society, regulators and organizations to
truly implement safety and security principles.
Furthermore, to responsibly implement leading-edge
technology, it is critical to reinforce the underlying
systems required to support it. Otherwise,
organizations will likely allow deficits in fundamental
security, resilience and trust to be exacerbated.

The 2024 Global Cyber Outlook findings indicate
that organizations are paying attention and reacting
quickly to mitigate the risks of adopting emerging
technology. The meteoric rise of large language
models (LLMs) and generative AI over the past
12 months is a key example. Although quantum
technologies may be temporary eclipsed by the zeal
surrounding generative AI, it is still on the minds
of respondents as a matter to be addressed. In
one way, quantum is making its way back to the
forefront; in November 2023, the United States was
working to instate the National Quantum Initiative
Reauthorization Act.^17

In the 2022 Global Cybersecurity Outlook,^18
approximately half of leaders said that automation
and machine learning would have the greatest
influence on cybersecurity in the following two years.
Nearly two years later, executives still feel the same –
this year, approximately half of leaders still agree that
generative AI will have the most significant impact on
cybersecurity in the next two years. Industries such
as cybersecurity (65%), agriculture (63%), banking
(56%) and insurance (56%) all had the largest
percentages of leaders choosing generative AI as
the biggest influence on cybersecurity.

| Industry                                    | Percentage of leaders who think generative AI will most significantly affect cybersecurity in the next two years | Percentage of leaders who think their organizations are at least minimally cyber resilient |

Leaders also express concerns about the impact
on cybersecurity in the near term. This year, 56%
of leaders said that generative AI will advantage
cyberattackers over defenders in the next two years.
More specifically, their greatest concern about
generative AI is that it will advance the adversary’s
ability to undertake actions that defenders are
already fighting against such as phishing, developing
custom malware and propagating misinformation.

As Kris Burkhardt, Global Chief Information Security
CISO from Accenture, stated:

> We must strengthen our defences across the board, and the
> same can be true for any emerging technology. A lot of the attack
> vectors seem to be the same, they just tend to be amplified.

The same attack vectors that have been employed
by cybercriminals are still being used; however, new
technology paves the way for nefarious activity.
Generative AI chatbots are making it much easier for
cybercriminals to create believable phishing emails and
write custom malware. Although popular commercial
chatbots have built-in censors and proactive controls
to prevent abuse, cybercriminals are adopting large
language models to design malicious subscription-
based services. Chatbots such as FraudGPT and
WormGPT are lowering the skills required to commit
complex and convincing campaigns.^19

### BOX 1: AI used to create convincing deepfake

In August 2023, a software company fell victim to
one of the most advanced and complicated social
engineering attacks, which used AI to create a
deepfake audio of an employee. The company was
first targeted through a well-timed and targeted
smishing campaign that was themed around open
enrolment for health insurance. One employee
clicked on the link in the text message and provided
their credentials to the fake system. Immediately
after the attacker received the credentials, they
called the employee’s phone to retrieve the
multifactor authentication (MFA) code.^20

These actions raised suspicion from the employee,
but because the attacker using a deepfake audio
of a familiar colleague, the employee ignored the
red flags and provided their MFA code to the
attacker. Between the credentials and the MFA
code, the attacker was able to add their personal
device to the employee’s Okta account (Okta is
an identity cloud that links all apps, logins and
devices). This allowed the attacker to gain approval
from the authentication systems used by the victim
organization.^21 Although direct attribution to a
malicious chatbot may be difficult, organizations
can expect even more of these complex and
convincing phishing, vishing and smishing attacks.^22

The tedious
job of data
classification can
be made less of
a manual chore
with the help of
generative AI.

For most organizations, the potential upside of
implementing leading-edge technologies such as
generative AI or the metaverse is vast. Generative
AI is predicted to increase global GDP by 7%
over a 10-year period.^23 Organizations around the
globe are able to use the metaverse as a safe,
effective and low-cost way to educate and train
people.^24 However, the speed and scale at which
technology is entering the ecosystem is deepening
executives’ concerns and stressing the underlying
technology systems in their organizations.

When 120 leaders at the World Economic
Forum’s Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity were
asked whether evaluating the impact of emerging
technology risk on the broader organization or
better covering cybersecurity fundamentals and
addressing existing gaps should be the bigger
priority for their board or most senior leadership
in the upcoming year, almost three-quarters (73%)
stressed the importance of cybersecurity
fundamentals and addressing existing gaps.

Leading-edge technology itself could also
be part of the solution. Applying emerging
technologies to foundational security elements
is a powerful opportunity to help alleviate the
reliability and availability challenges with which
many organizations have struggled for years.

A prime example of this is the improvement of the
software development life cycle (SDLC). Prompts
to an LLM can be used as a method of ensuring
that requirements, design guidelines or software
architecture are all coded and implemented as
planned in the software.^25 The LLM can evaluate
and review the code with precision and speed
and serve as a way to test the code for errors or
scan for vulnerabilities before release. Software
engineers can partner with LLMs to work towards
developing more complete, secure code, eliminating
some of the human-error aspects of the SDLC.

To take this a step further, LLMs can be
used to help translate software developed in
deprecated or obsolete code into a current,
more secure language. Setting aside concerns
about propriety code being leaked, all of
the above use cases would vastly benefit
the security of open-source software.

The SDLC is not the only area to benefit from
LLMs. The tedious job of data classification can
be made less of a manual chore with the help
of generative AI. Many of the large software
organizations are creating tools that will enable
an organization to automate the process of
ensuring data is classified and marked in line
with organizational policy. When 13% of leaders
state that employees were the reason behind
a material incident in the past 12 months, data
labelling and marking becomes imperative.

Applying and using LLMs in a security operations
centre (SOC) is another way to adopt emerging
technology into existing foundational cybersecurity.
LLMs can be used as a way of automating or
assisting an analyst to threat-hunt with more
accuracy or develop less noisy and higher-
fidelity rules. In fact, according to Splunk’s The
CISO Report, 27% of surveyed chief information
security officers (CISOs) will use generative
AI in their SOCs to do just that – provide
data enrichment of alerts and incidents.^26

These three examples are only illustrations of
how generative AI can be used to alleviate some
of the issues with established cybersecurity
challenges; however, it cannot solve all of them.
In its current state, it will not be able to fully
replace skills that are grounded in creativity
or human judgement nor require nuanced
communication decisions, which include roles
such as information security analysts.^27

## 3 In the thick of the
cyber-skills shortage

Creative action is needed to address
the growing cyber-skills gap.

### 3.1 The skills gap

Executives know that in an evolving cybersecurity
landscape, with economic uncertainties, attracting
and retaining cybersecurity talent is a crucial
aspect of organizational success. The supply of
emerging technology entering the digital ecosystem
will continue to significantly intensify the demand
for skilled professionals. Yet the pool of available
professionals is already too small and the pipeline
of rising talent is woefully dry. Year on year, more
organizations lack the right number of people with the
right skills to meet their cyber-resilience objectives.

In 2022, 6% of leaders reported that they were
missing the skills and people they needed to
respond to a cyber incident. In 2023, this doubled
to 12%. This year, when asked whether their
organization has the skills it needs to accomplish its
cyber objectives, 20% said that they do not. Leaders
who are unsure if they have the required skill sets
also rose from 4% in 2022 to 11% this year.

![Figure 5: Do you have the skills needed to achieve your cybersecurity objectives?]

This shortage is not related solely to having the
resources to perform specific tasks; a lack of
critical technical and soft skills is quickly becoming
the largest barrier preventing an organization from
achieving its strategic cyber-resilience objectives.
This year, 36% of respondents said that skills
gaps are the main challenge to achieving their
cyber-resilience goals. Some 78% of respondents
reported that their organizations do not have the
in-house skills to fully achieve their cybersecurity
objectives. This is worsened when factoring in that
57% of respondents from an ISC2 cybersecurity
workforce study^28 believe that the shortage
of cybersecurity staff is putting organizations
