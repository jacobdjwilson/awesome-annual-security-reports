## Foreword
In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, 
this year’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook provides 
crucial insights into the multifaceted challenges 
facing leaders across the globe. Geopolitical 
instability, rapidly advancing technologies and an 
increasing gap in organizational cyber capabilities 
reinforce the need to build resilience and enable 
systemic global collaboration.
Building on the priorities outlined in last year’s 
report, the World Economic Forum’s Centre for 
Cybersecurity remains committed to bridging the 
gaps between the public and private sectors and 
between cyber and business leaders. The report 
serves as an instrument to distil cyber-risk issues into 
achievable insights tailored to today’s executives.
While there is a notable sense of optimism 
stemming from increased executive-level awareness 
of the cybersecurity ecosystem and its risks, the 
report also underscores a growing cyber divide. 
Organizations demonstrating cyber resilience 
are increasingly distinct from those grappling 
with cybersecurity challenges. The dialogue 
between cyber and business executives has 
shown improvement, yet significant disparities 
persist among industries, countries and sectors, 
demanding continued attention and collaboration.
Looking ahead to the challenges of 2024, the report 
illuminates major findings and puts a spotlight 
on the widening cyber inequity and the profound 
impact of emerging technologies. The path forward 
demands strategic thinking, concerted action and a 
steadfast commitment to cyber resilience.
This report invites leaders not only to recognize 
the hurdles but also to actively embrace the 
opportunities for positive change. It is a call for 
collective effort and innovation, urging leaders to 
work collaboratively towards a more secure, resilient 
and trustworthy digital future.

## Executive summary
In 2023 the world faced a polarized geopolitical 
order, multiple armed conflicts, both scepticism and 
fervour about the implications of future technologies, 
and global economic uncertainty. Amid this complex 
landscape, the cybersecurity economy[^1] grew 
exponentially faster than the overall global economy, 
and outpaced growth in the tech sector.[^2] However, 
many organizations and countries experienced that 
growth in exceptionally different ways. 
A stark divide between cyber-resilient organizations 
and those that are struggling has emerged. This 
clear divergence in cyber equity is exacerbated 
by the contours of the threat landscape, 
macroeconomic trends, industry regulation and early 
adoption of paradigm-shifting technology by some 
organizations. Other clear barriers, including the 
rising cost of access to innovative cyber services, 
tools, skills and expertise, continue to influence 
the ability of the global ecosystem to build a more 
secure cyberspace in the face of myriad transitions. 
These factors are also ever-present in the 
accelerated disappearance of a healthy “middle 
grouping” of organizations (i.e. those that maintain 
minimum standards of cyber resilience only). Despite 
this divide, many organizations indicate clear 
progress in certain aspects of their cyber capability. 
This year’s outlook also finds cause for optimism, 
especially when considering the relationship 
between cyber and business executives.
These are the major findings from this year’s Global 
Cybersecurity Outlook and the key cyber trends 
that executives will need to navigate in 2024:
There is growing cyber inequity 
between organizations that are 
cyber resilient and those that  
are not. 
In parallel, the population of organizations that 
maintain a minimum level of cyber resilience is 
disappearing. Small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs),[^3] despite making up the majority of many 
country’s ecosystems, are being disproportionately 
affected by this disparity.
	
- The number of organizations that maintain 
minimum viable cyber resilience is down 30%. 
While large organizations demonstrated 
remarkable gains in cyber resilience, SMEs 
showed a significant decline. 
	
- More than twice as many SMEs as the largest 
organizations say they lack the cyber resilience 
to meet their critical operational requirements. 
	
- 90% of the 120 executives surveyed at the 
World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting on 
Cybersecurity said that urgent action is required 
to address this growing cyber inequity. 
Emerging technology will 
exacerbate long-standing 
challenges related to cyber 
resilience.
This will in turn accelerate the divide between the 
most capable and the least capable organizations. 
	
- As organizations race to adopt new technologies, 
such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), a 
basic understanding is needed of the immediate, 
mid-term and long-term implications of these 
technologies for their cyber-resilience posture. 
	
- Fewer than one in 10 respondents believe that 
in the next two years generative AI will give the 
advantage to defenders over attackers. 
	
- Approximately half of executives say that 
advances in adversarial capabilities (phishing, 
malware, deepfakes) present the most 
concerning impact of generative AI on cyber.
The cyber-skills and talent 
shortage continues to widen  
at an alarming rate.
	
- Half of the smallest organizations by revenue 
say they either do not have or are unsure as to 
whether they have the skills they need to meet 
their cyber objectives. 
	
- Only 15% of all organizations are optimistic 
that cyber skills and education will significantly 
improve in the next two years.
	
- 52% of public organizations state that a lack of 
resources and skills is their biggest challenge 
when designing for cyber resilience.
Looming cyber inequity amid a rapidly evolving 
tech landscape emphasizes the need for even 
greater public-private cooperation.

Alignment between cyber  
and business is becoming  
more common.
Organizations (including both business and cyber 
leaders)[^4] must continue to invest in and maintain an 
awareness of essential security fundamentals. 
	
- 29% of organizations reported that they had 
been materially affected by a cyber incident in 
the past 12 months.
	
- The largest organizations say that the highest 
barrier to cyber resilience is transforming legacy 
technology and processes.
	
- There is a clear link between cyber resilience 
and CEO engagement. This year, 93% of 
respondents that consider their organizations 
to be leaders and innovators in cyber resilience 
trust their CEO to speak externally about their 
cyber risk. Of organizations that are not cyber 
resilient, only 23% trust their CEO’s ability to 
speak about their cyber risk.
Cyber ecosystem risk is 
becoming more problematic.
For any organization, the partners in its ecosystem 
are both the greatest asset and the biggest 
hindrance to a secure, resilient and trustworthy 
digital future.
	
- 41% of the organizations that suffered a material 
incident in the past 12 months say it was 
caused by a third party. 
	
- 54% of organizations have an insufficient 
understanding of cyber vulnerabilities in their 
supply chain. Even 64% of executives who 
believe that their organization’s cyber resilience 
meets its minimum requirements to operate say 
they still have an inadequate understanding of 
their supply-chain cyber vulnerabilities.
	
- 60% of executives agree that cyber and privacy 
regulations effectively reduce risk in their 
organization’s ecosystem – up 21% since 2022.

## 1 Understanding global cyber inequity
A systemic solution is needed to address 
the inequity in cyber-resilience capacity 
across organizations and countries.
Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024
8
In 2022, the cybersecurity economy[^5] grew 
twice as fast as the world economy.[^6] In 2023, it 
grew four times faster. Although organizational 
investment in cyber resilience overall is on the rise, 
rapid innovation and growth often lead to uneven 
development. 
This unevenness creates major economic and 
social benefits for some; generally, the largest and 
most developed economies reap the rewards of 
new technologies, while less developed nations, 
sectors and communities continue to fall behind. 
In this case, rapid technological growth, although 
benefiting many in terms of access, innovation and 
even collaboration, is also creating systemic inequity 
in the global cybersecurity economy and belies a 
pronounced disparity between the cyber-resilience 
capability of organizations that make up its markets. 
The 2024 Global Cybersecurity Outlook (GCO) finds 
that organizations that maintain minimum viable 
cyber resilience – that is, a healthy middle grouping 
of organizations – are disappearing. Organizations 
reporting such a minimum viable cyber resilience 
are down 31% since 2022. The distance between 
organizations that are cyber resilient enough to 
thrive and those that are fighting to survive is 
widening at an alarming rate. As a result, the least 
capable organizations are perpetually unable to 
keep up with the curve, falling further behind and 
threatening the integrity of the entire ecosystem. 
The cost of accessing adequate cyber services, 
tools and talent, and the early adoption of cutting-
edge technology by the largest organizations in the 
ecosystem are two core factors driving the divide. 
A few statistics further illustrate the trend towards 
imbalance. The smallest organizations are more 
than twice as likely as the largest to say they 
lack the cyber resilience they need to meet their 
minimum critical operational requirements.[^7] At the 
other end of the spectrum, the highest-revenue 
organizations are 22% more confident than the 
smallest organizations that their cyber resilience 
exceeds their operational needs. And yet the 
smallest-revenue organizations are also a troubling 
three times more likely to lack the cyber skills they 
need to meet their cyber-resilience objectives.
This phenomenon is particularly alarming in light of 
the interconnected nature of the cyber ecosystem. 
One of the core measurements of cyber resilience 
is an understanding of your ecosystem, inclusive of 
assessments of supply-chain and third-party risk. 
For those large organizations reporting that they are 
leaders in cyber resilience, the emergence of this 
drastic drop in cyber resilience of small organizations 
should be especially alarming. Consider a 2023 
report from SecurityScorecard and the Cyentia 
Institute, which found that “98% of organizations 
have a relationship with at least one third party that 
has experienced a breach in the last two years”.[^8] 
This type of entanglement should be reason enough 
for those that are most cyber resilient to proactively 
help organizations in their ecosystem to move 
towards a healthier cyber posture. 
Several other factors may unduly influence and 
exacerbate the vulnerabilities of those SMEs in 
this widening disparity. Among small organizations 
– which are often unable to prevent critical 
operational disruption from an incident and can 
incur disproportionate financial loss to recover – 
only 25% carry cyber insurance. That’s three times 
less likely than the largest organizations by revenue, 
which report a 75% cyber-insurance adoption rate. 
The results are also consistent for organization 
size by employee count. The more employees 
within an organization, the higher the adoption 
rate of cyber insurance; 85% of organizations 
with more than 100,000 employees carry cyber 
insurance, while only 21% of organizations with 250 
employees or fewer have a policy. As the prices of 
cyber insurance continue to rise exponentially, the 
expectation is that this gap will widen in parallel, 
leaving smaller organizations with even fewer 
options to reduce their risk.

Globally, disparity across geographies is also 
reflected in the analysis. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 
this global cyber gap tends to mirror other global 
development indicators. The lowest number of 
self-reported cyber-resilient organizations are 
in Latin America and Africa, while the highest 
number come from North America and Europe. 
Similarly, Latin America and Africa reported the 
highest number of insufficiently cyber-resilient 
organizations, while North America and Europe 
reported the lowest number.
This phenomenon, sometimes characterized as 
the “cybersecurity poverty line (CPL)”, generally 
refers to the prohibitive cost of securing robust 
cybersecurity for an organization’s personnel, 
technology and systems. But this divide goes far 
beyond prohibitive costs. Consider the cyber-
skills gap, a well-documented issue for even the 
largest global organizations. Other factors, such as 
knowledgeable leaders, the ability to understand 
shifting best practices, and access to highly 
innovative technologies, also dramatically affect 
an organization’s ability to stay ahead of the curve. 
As the Atlantic Council puts it, “Cyber poverty 
exhibits dynamics very similar to real-world poverty: 
simply providing money or free expertise does not 
necessarily address poor technological designs, 
poor market incentives, misaligned sociocultural 
attitudes towards security, or other barriers.”[^9]
The disparity may be ultra-visible now, but it has 
been developing for years, and the cyber-resilience 
inequity trend has been steadily increasing over time. 
Among the lowest-revenue organizations, lack of 
sufficient cyber resilience is up a troubling 32% since 
2022. Among the highest-revenue organizations, 
reported deficiencies in cyber resilience are similar to 
those reported two years ago. 
Additionally, the number of organizations with lower 
revenue that reported their cyber resilience exceeds 
their operational requirements has not increased 
over the past two years. Conversely, among large-
revenue organizations, cyber confidence rose 32%.
Although there are generalized economic norms 
indicating that this is healthy competition, cyber 
leaders know that the digital ecosystem is so 
intertwined and fragile that to continue on this 
trajectory is more harmful than healthy.
When asked to comment on this disappearing 
middle grouping of organizations, Rotem Iram,  
Chief Executive Officer of At-Bay, neatly summed it  
up in this way:
> Security solutions are becoming too sophisticated, to the point 
where many SMEs struggle to operate them, let alone afford them.
Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024
10
Organizations of all sizes and maturity levels 
have often struggled to maintain central tenets of 
organizational cyber resilience. Historically, however, 
several factors began to stratify the cyber capability 
of both public- and private-sector organizations. 
Some organizations prioritized resilience, 
incorporated it into corporate culture and invested 
accordingly, while others did not. Some sectors 
more strictly regulated their members – for example, 
out of concern for human safety or national security, 
to safeguard personally protected information, 
or to protect the global financial system. Other 
organizations were forced to contend with a more 
hostile threat landscape and suffered a significant, 
often public incident.
Over time, differences in organizational, sectoral and 
country-specific circumstances, as well as varied 
responses to universal cyber challenges, separated 
the market into clear leaders and stragglers. Add to 
the equation the pace of the rising cost of access to 
adequate cybersecurity capability and what results 
is the current state of cyber inequity between small 
and large organizations, between the public and 
private sectors, and among organizations operating 
in different economies around the world. 
The digital divide in access to the internet provides 
a useful parallel. Consider the comment from Angel 
Gonzalez Sanz, Head of Science, Technology and 
Innovation in the Division on Technology and Logistics 
of the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD), that, “although 63% of 
the world’s population is connected to the internet; 
least developed countries still only count 27% of 
their populations as internet users”.[^10] The digital 
ecosystem is so highly interconnected and influenced 
by geopolitics, economics and the rapid emergence 
of new technology that no entity can afford to be 
perpetually trapped under the capability curve, least of 
all the organizations that are already the most at risk. 
As Abhay Raman, Senior Vice-President and Chief 
Security Officer at Sun Life, put it:
> The risks associated with continuing to 
exacerbate this technological divide between 
organizations and nations that can and cannot 
adequately mitigate cyber events poses both 
a threat to the entire ecosystem and outsized 
risks to those that are already vulnerable. The 
imbalance in global internet access presents 
a prescient example of the consequences of 
sustaining an unequal digital ecosystem.
Doing so requires a systemic solution, with 
participation from everyone – SMEs, multinational 
corporations (MNCs), non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and governmental 
organizations. Fortunately, cyber executives 
agree: 90% of the 120 executives surveyed at 
the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting on 
Cybersecurity said that urgent action is required 
to address this growing cyber inequity. There is 
evidence of an appetite for systemic collaboration 
that supports SMEs. For example, in 2020, the 
World Economic Forum brought together partners 
from telecommunication companies, civil society 
and cyber organizations to publish cybercrime 
prevention principles for internet services providers. 
This is an example of systemically important actors 
such as internet service providers working to protect 
the entire ecosystem, including smaller players.[^11]
> Affordability is a critical determinant of cyber-resilience success. 
We should therefore design risk-appropriate, affordable and  
fit-for-use cyber-resilience architectures for large multinationals  
and SMEs alike.
### 1.2 Core drivers of cyber inequity
Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024

## 2 A world in geopolitical 
and technological 
transition
The rapid spread of generative AI and 
other new technologies that can easily be 
used by cyberattackers poses a serious 
threat both for business and in public life. 
Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024
12
In this year’s Global Cybersecurity Outlook survey, 
70% of leaders stated that geopolitics has at 
least moderately influenced their organization’s 
cybersecurity strategy. The influence of geopolitics 
has remained as persistently top of mind as it was 
last year, with 74% of respondents from the 2023 
report stating the same. This year, 32% of 37 CISOs 
surveyed separately said they are adjusting their 
cybersecurity strategy by increasing the use of 
threat intelligence reports and further developing 
their incident response plans. Increasingly alarming 
attacks against critical infrastructure, and elements 
in global supply chains, coupled with economic 
instability, have the potential to cause macro-impact. 
Geopolitics also directly influences how quickly 
the risk landscape can shift for an organization 
or country. Some 72% of leaders report that they 
understand this rapidly shifting landscape and are 
actively integrating current events into how they 
manage their cyber risks. 
Just as cybersecurity breaches weaken our faith in 
the systems that underpin economies and societies, 
other technological risks, such as disinformation, 
can do the same. Often the same defenders are 
called upon to help combat both. A key example of 
this is how public- and private-sector organizations 
alike are reevaluating both the vulnerabilities 
of specific institutions and processes, such as 
elections, in the face of intense geopolitical strife, 
and increased technological capability. 
An example of the intersection of geopolitical 
turmoil and artificial intelligence, deepfakes 
and sophisticated phishing campaigns have 
the potential to become weaponized to disrupt 
democratic election procedures. Although 
information warfare is not a new concept, the 
decentralization of information sources, and the 
rapid advance of technology, makes defending 
against these types of malicious threats a key 
concern in the coming year and beyond. 
Looking ahead to 2024, these risks will compound 
to take centre stage. More than 45 countries will 
hold elections over the next year to determine 
who governs more than 50% of the world’s GDP.[^12] 
With the proliferation of new technologies such as 
generative AI and their use by cyber adversaries 
becoming more widespread, safeguarding the 
integrity and fairness of the electoral process 
becomes of paramount importance.
In Slovakia’s September 2023 elections, for instance, 
a deepfake audio clip was released that purported to 
show a candidate discussing how to manipulate the 
election with a media representative.[^13]
Artificial intelligence advances pose more risks than 
deepfakes or misinformation. To understand the 
intersection of cyber and election security,[^14] there 
are six areas of risk that should be noted as next 
year’s elections unfold.
	
- Misinformation and disinformation: organized 
campaigns spreading misinformation through 
social media or other channels can influence 
public opinion, cast doubt on election integrity 
and sway election outcomes.
	
- Deepfakes: in this specific species of 
disinformation, AI-generated deepfake videos 
or audio recordings can be used to spread false 
information about candidates or manipulate 
public perception.
	
- Automated disinformation: AI algorithms can 
be employed to generate and spread large 
volumes of disinformation, making it harder to 
detect and combat.
	
- Targeted advertising: AI-driven microtargeting 
of mis- or disinformation of voters through 
personalized advertisements can be used to 
manipulate opinions or suppress voter turnout.
	
- Data privacy concerns: where voting 
information is drawn from national ID, residence 
records or other methods that connect 
to personally identifiable information (PII), 
automated processing may create avenues for 
the leakage of personal data not relevant to 
voting eligibility determinations.
	
- Algorithmic manipulation of social media: 
AI algorithms on social media platforms can 
be manipulated to amplify certain political 
messages or suppress others, influencing 
public opinion.
It is worth noting that while generative AI will add to 
the complexity of attacks, it is not the only concern 
in relation to the rise in cybercriminal activity due 
to geopolitical tensions. Over the past five years, 
the number of malware families[^15] and variants that 
have infiltrated at least 10% of global organizations 
has doubled.[^16] 
Cyberthreats to the electoral process are just 
one example of how the confluence of emerging 
tech, cyber and geopolitics might demand global 
attention in the coming year. A collaborative 
approach ensures a multipronged defence strategy, 
fortifying the overall resilience of election systems 
against a diverse spectrum of cyberthreats.

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024
13
Emerging technology is becoming available more 
widely and far faster than in the past. This rapid 
uptake of technologies has outpaced the ability 
of civil society, regulators and organizations to 
truly implement safety and security principles. 
Furthermore, to responsibly implement leading-edge 
technology, it is critical to reinforce the underlying 
systems required to support it. Otherwise, 
organizations will likely allow deficits in fundamental 
security, resilience and trust to be exacerbated. 
The 2024 Global Cyber Outlook findings indicate 
that organizations are paying attention and reacting 
quickly to mitigate the risks of adopting emerging 
technology. The meteoric rise of large language 
models (LLMs) and generative AI over the past 
12 months is a key example. Although quantum 
technologies may be temporary eclipsed by the zeal 
surrounding generative AI, it is still on the minds 
of respondents as a matter to be addressed. In 
one way, quantum is making its way back to the 
forefront; in November 2023, the United States was 
working to instate the National Quantum Initiative 
Reauthorization Act.[^17]
In the 2022 Global Cybersecurity Outlook,[^18] 
approximately half of leaders said that automation 
and machine learning would have the greatest 
influence on cybersecurity in the following two years. 
Nearly two years later, executives still feel the same – 
this year, approximately half of leaders still agree that 
generative AI will have the most significant impact on 
cybersecurity in the next two years. Industries such 
as cybersecurity (65%), agriculture (63%), banking 
(56%) and insurance (56%) all had the largest 
percentages of leaders choosing generative AI as 
the biggest influence on cybersecurity.
