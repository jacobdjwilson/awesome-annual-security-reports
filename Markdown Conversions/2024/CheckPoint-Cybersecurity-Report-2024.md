CHECK POINT SOFTWARE  |  SECURITY REPORT 2024
Welcome to the Check Point 2024 Cyber Security Report. In 2023, the world of cyber 
security witnessed significant changes, with the nature and scale of cyber attacks 
evolving rapidly. This year, we saw cyber threats stepping out from the shadows of the 
online world into the spotlight, grabbing the attention of everyone from government 
agencies to the general public. 
The reasons behind these attacks have become as varied as the methods used. 
Ransomware remained a major threat, with attackers not just after money, but also 
seeking recognition. Ransomware attacks exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities while 
using shame sites for publicly revealing who their victims are became more popular, 
turning ransomware into a sort of competition among cybercriminals. The cost of  
these attacks went beyond just paying the ransom, with companies like MGM, DP World, 
and the British Library facing huge expenses to rebuild their systems.
We also saw an increase in hacktivism, where hackers are driven by political or social 
causes. This type of hacking, once a tool for individual activists, is now being used by 
governments as a way to attack adversaries indirectly. This was especially noticeable  
in the wake of events like the Russo-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Attackers found new ways to break into systems, with devices like routers and switches 
becoming easy targets. Big organizations, including Okta and 23AndMe, were hit by 
attacks that used stolen login details or malicious software.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) played a bigger role in cyber attacks this year. Attackers 
started using AI tools to make their phishing campaigns more effective. However, the 
good news is that AI is also being used by cyber defenders to better protect against 
these threats.

There were some wins against cybercriminals too. Law enforcement agencies, including 
the FBI, made progress in taking down major threats like the Hive Ransomware network 
and the Qbot infrastructure. But the comeback of some of these groups reminds us that 
the fight against cybercrime is ongoing.
This report looks back at the major cyber security events of 2023, offering insights and 
analysis to help understand and prepare for the challenges ahead. Our goal is to provide 
valuable information to organizations, policy makers, and cyber security professionals, 
helping them to build stronger defenses in an increasingly digital world.
We hope you find this report informative and useful in your efforts to keep your digital 
environments secure.
