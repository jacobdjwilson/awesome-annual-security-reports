## Introduction

2024 was a frenetic year for the underground, with law enforcement operations impeding and at times upending mature cyber criminal enterprises. In ransomware, we saw the slow decline of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) leader LockBit following Operation Cronos and consequently the rapid rise of RansomHub in its place. From the very start of the year and throughout, we were reminded of the far-reaching, insidious threat of vulnerabilities and the panic they can engender. This was all the more telling given the frequency with which extortion groups relied on vulnerabilities for initial access. Meanwhile, embattled malware operators sought to mitigate the damages of successful botnet disruptions through the adoption of novel campaigns, and the information stealer cemented its position as the most impactful malware threat. Lastly, a review of 2024 would not be complete without a look at the most exciting, yet sometimes confusing, developing technology — artificial intelligence (AI).

## Law Enforcement Operations

The cybercriminal underground historically has been shaped by global law enforcement operations that target key actors and infrastructure, and this was never more apparent than in 2024. A consistent cadence of operations throughout the year contributed to a slowing of some of the most maligned cyber threats, including ransomware and the proliferation of malware. The scale of the operations was grand, with the targeting of the biggest name in ransomware and the disruption of some of the most mature botnet operations active in the underground. The impressive impact law enforcement agencies were able to effectuate was in part due to the adoption of aggressive media campaigns where they implemented baiting techniques that were picked up and amplified in open source and the underground. Furthermore, a steady flow of sanctions against cybercriminals — past and present — demonstrated the possible ramifications of a life of crime and thrust those impacted into the limelight.

The most impactful operations witnessed this year included:

### Op Cronos

On Feb. 20, 2024, the U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and the U.S. FBI announced the disruption of the LockBit RaaS as a result of Operation Cronos, a coordinated effort involving law enforcement agencies from 10 countries. This sparked a sequence of events in which the NCA obtained more than 1,000 LockBit ransomware decryption keys, numerous LockBit and Evil Corp members were indicted, numerous individuals linked to LockBit were indicted or arrested across the globe and more than 200 cryptocurrency accounts linked to the group were frozen.1, 2, 3, 4

### Op Endgame

From May 27, 2024, to May 29, 2024, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and law enforcement agencies from several countries targeted multiple malware droppers including IcedID, SystemBC, Pikabot, SmokeLoader, Bumblebee and Trickbot in the “largest ever operation against botnets.” On May 30, 2024, Europol announced the joint operation dubbed Operation Endgame resulted in the disruption of infrastructure used by the botnets, as well as arrests, server takedowns and domain seizures. The operation was initiated and led by officers in France, Germany and the Netherlands and supported by the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) and several other countries. It led to four arrests — one in Armenia and three in Ukraine — 16 location searches, the takedown of more than 100 servers and law enforcement taking control of more than 2,000 domains. Additionally, Europol added eight additional fugitives linked to this criminal activity to Europe’s Most Wanted list.

From May 31, 2024, to Aug. 8, 2024, Europol officials released eight stylized videos on its website dedicated to Operation Endgame where they revealed actor names and provided cryptic clues regarding their operations. In September 2024, Europol released a teaser for season two, which appears to indicate underground cryptocurrency exchanges would be the next target.5, 6

### Op Magnus

On Oct. 28, 2024, we observed discussions on social media about a disruption operation ostensibly by the Dutch National Police and international law enforcement partners against the RedLine and Meta information-stealer malware infrastructure. The following day, Dutch and U.S. authorities confirmed a disruption operation against the RedLine and Meta information-stealing malware dubbed Operation Magnus. The coordinated law enforcement action reportedly resulted in the seizure of two domains and three command-and-control (C2) servers supporting the stealers. Multiple associated Telegram channels were taken offline and millions of compromised victim credentials were recovered. Additionally, U.S. authorities unsealed charges against Maxim Rudometov, an alleged developer of RedLine.7, 8

### TheCom charges, arrests

TheCom is a broad online ecosystem composed of diverse communities and individuals with a significant number of youths operating mostly from Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. that engage in cybercriminal activities such as subscriber identity module (SIM) card-swapping, cryptocurrency theft, online harassment, swatting, bricking and corporate intrusions. This online ecosystem is assessed as the origin of high-profile threat groups over the past years including LAPSUS$, Roasting 0ktapus and the Scattered Spider, UNC3944, Octo Tempest and Muddled Libra intrusion clusters.9

Several individuals were charged or arrested in law enforcement operations targeting cybercriminals linked to TheCom this year that included:

*   In January 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced details of an indictment with a series of charges against the individual Noah Michael Urban aka Sosa, Elijah, King Bob, Anthony Ramirez, linked with the Roasting 0ktapus group.

*   In June 2024, the Spanish National Police and the U.S. FBI announced a U.K. national allegedly involved in a spree of corporate intrusions was arrested in a joint operation. The individual was identified as Tyler Buchanan aka tylerb, another member of the Roasting 0ktapus group.

*   In October 2024, an FBI special agent filed a criminal complaint charging the individual Remington Goy Ogletree aka remi with wire fraud in relation to alleged crimes linked to the Scattered Spider intrusion cluster.

*   In October 2024, Alexander “Connor” Moucka aka judische was taken into custody on a provisional arrest warrant, according to Canada’s Department of Justice. The actor was linked to the large-scale supply chain attack impacting the U.S.-based cloud storage provider Snowflake.

*   In November 2024, the FBI unsealed criminal charges against five defendants in connection with a phishing campaign — Ahmed Hossam Eldin Elbadawy aka AD, Noah Michael Urban aka Sosa, Evans Onyeaka Osiebo, Joel Martin Evans aka joeleoli and Tyler Robert Buchanan aka tylerb. We previously linked joeleoli and Sosa to the Roasting 0ktapus group.10, 11, 12

### Op Passionflower

On Dec. 3, 2024, Europol announced the results of an international law enforcement operation named Operation Passionflower that targeted the Matrix aka Mactrix, Totalsec, X-quantum, Q-safe encrypted messaging platform. The platform’s infrastructure consisted of more than 40 servers and was taken down by Dutch and French authorities with follow-up actions carried out by law enforcement agencies in Italy, Lithuania and Spain. Europol’s statement revealed the authorities were monitoring the platform and intercepting communications for three months prior to the takedown. The operation came hot off the heels of Telegram updating its terms of services and privacy policy confirming the intent to comply with information sharing requests from authorities, including IP addresses and phone numbers.13

## Hacktivism Gets Physical: Now Targeting Critical OT

As is often the case, the hacktivism scene is inextricably linked to global geopolitics. In 2024, there was no shortage of events that dictated the direction of travel for many of the key hacktivist groups we track. The pro-Russian hacktivism fraternity primarily focused on influencing the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war by targeting governments or institutions that offered support to Ukraine while attempting to degrade Ukrainian infrastructure directly with attacks. The situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories developed into a humanitarian crisis that polarized governments and hacktivists. As a result, Israel was targeted repeatedly by a host of groups proclaiming to be ideologically motivated, however, among those likely were several state-associated groups. Away from conflict, a year of elections, sporting events and divisive politics provided ample opportunity for groups seeking to disrupt.

### Pro-Russian Hacktivist Groups Reduce in Number, Maintain Operational Output

![Figure 3: The image depicts Intel 471’s current understanding of the pro-Russian hacktivist landscape.](https://www.intel471.com/resources/whitepapers/the-471-cyber-threat-report-2024/images/figure3.png)

2024 was another dynamic year for pro-Russian hacktivists, with many groups forging new partnerships and alliances, and others that were active in previous years dropping away. For example, the much publicized KillNet and its various splinter groups slowed their operational cadence and came to a halt in September 2024. The spiritual successor Just Evil, run by the actor KillMilk, continued to demonstrate sporadic activity. One of the most active alliances was the triumvirate of NoName057(16), CyberArmyRussia and OverFlame. The trio consistently targeted Ukraine and countries that demonstrated material or diplomatic support to Ukraine. The CyberArmyRussia group possibly has an association with the Russian state, supported by its leader’s claim to have received recognition for its support to the Russian cause.14 The NoName057(16) group most consistently led our coverage in terms of volume of operations, which likely contributed to its success in forging partnerships.

### High Impact Hacktivist Operations

We tracked hundreds of operations coined by hacktivism groups in 2024. However, three stood out due to the persistence and number of organizations targeted:

*   Op404 — The operation primarily was led by NoName057(16) and often used as a catch-all for Russia-Ukraine war-related targeting. Victims were from a variety of countries but most often involved the targeting of Ukraine. The campaign primarily focused on targeting regional and national entities in Ukraine with the most emphasis placed on any entities that fell within critical infrastructure sectors.15

*   OpIsrael — This is an annual operation we have tracked since 2018. The operation usually takes place in April and historically acted as a vehicle for hacktivist groups to show their support to the Palestinian people. However, given the extraordinary year for Israel, the Palestinian territories and the region at large, the operation has been used throughout as a call to arms for a multitude of hacktivist groups. While the number of groups that have attached themselves to the conflict is in the hundreds, the groups most active this year were Handala, 1915 Team, Gaza Children’s group and The Returnees.

*   OpFrance — This year was politically frantic for France. The country underwent a snap election, endured several protests and hosted the Olympics — one of the most watched events globally — all of which provided justification for hacktivist groups to wage disruptive campaigns that often fell under the OpFrance hashtag. Furthermore, French President Emmanuel Macron remained hawkish toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s intention in Europe, which galvanized many of the pro-Russian groups identified in figure 3.

### New Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

#### Targeting operational technology systems

A trend we observed this year was the increased targeting of operational technology (OT) systems by hacktivist groups. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)-associated Cyber Av3ngers group gained notoriety in late 2023 when it impacted both Israel- and U.S.-based infrastructure through the compromise of Israeli-made Unitronics Vision Series programmable logic controllers (PLCs). A similar attack occurred in January 2024 when the CyberArmyRussia group claimed access to multiple U.S. water companies’ supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems.16 In September 2024, members of the Iranian BLACK MASK TEAM hacktivist group claimed to compromise 49 SCADA systems and human-machine interface (HMI) displays in multiple countries.17 Success likely inspired similar attacks as the year wore on.

#### Sabotage-for-hire

In August 2024, we reported on the growing number of sabotage-for-hire offers on underground forums. The advertisements predominantly targeted individuals within

Ukraine and often would promise large sums of money for a variety of actions, which included conducting arson, border crossing, physical assaults, property damage and surveillance.18 Later in the year, we witnessed these offers migrate to hacktivism communities — specifically those associated with the actor KillMilk, such as the Just Evil and CROK Telegram channels.19, 20

## Summary

This year, we witnessed hacktivist groups become more akin to deniable tools of state power than the autonomous disruptive ideologues of the past. Anti-Israeli groups demonstrated this trend more profoundly, as numerous groups reportedly were associated with the Iranian intelligence apparatus. However, it is less clear with the pro-Russian cadre whether their actions are more influenced by the state or by nationalistic sentiment among the disaffected. Regardless, many hacktivist groups demonstrated a genuine understanding of geopolitics and were able to leverage global events to justify their actions. Their aims likely are to sway governmental decision-making and/or incur cost on their targets. In this vein, the trend of targeting OT is a growing concern since it enables hacktivist groups to have greater impact than traditional distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) or defacement attacks and also provides a vector into national infrastructure.
