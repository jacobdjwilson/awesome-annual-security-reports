H1 2024:
Malware and Vulnerability
Trends Report

Vulnerabilities affecting widely
used remote access and security
software, such as Ivanti Secure
Connect, Palo Alto Networks
PAN-OS, and Microsoft Windows
SmartScreen, were the most
exploited in the first half of 2024.

Infostealers dominated the malware
landscape in the first half of 2024,
with LummaC2 being the most
prevalent strain. Insikt Group
also observed a 103% increase in
Magecart infections since the second
half of 2023.

Fog, Raspberry Robin, and SocGholish
malware operators, among others,
updated existing tools and introduced
new techniques to their ransomware,
trojans, infostealers, and malware
loaders to increase the chances of
evading detection and impeding analysis.

## Executive Summary

The malware and vulnerability exploitation landscape in the first half of 2024 (H1 2024) largely saw
threat actors refining known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and experimenting with new
ones to disrupt and circumvent the defenses enterprises rely on.

We observed the prolonged exploitation of newly disclosed vulnerabilities (zero-days) affecting remote
access and security solutions even after patches became available (at which point the vulnerabilities
became n-days). Threat actors also updated their malware capabilities and refined their delivery
mechanisms to evade detection and hinder analysis, such as ransomware operators requiring
passwords for malware to run on victim systems. Overall, information stealing (infostealer) malware
dominated the malware landscape, and Magecart attacks, whereby threat actors compromise
e-commerce websites with malicious code designed to steal customersʼ personal and financial
information, increased by approximately 103% in the first six months of 2024.

Taken together, zero-day vulnerability exploitation and new malware TTPs to prevent detection and
analysis heighten threats for organizations because both factors lower defendersʼ ability to detect
malicious activity in a timely manner. As a result, threat actors can gain more time to act on their
objectives, increasing the likelihood of more severe harm to targeted organizations.

To address the threat trends of H1 2024, a layered defense and proactive monitoring are essential.
Enhancing patch management procedures, particularly for highly targeted software like remote access
and security tools, helps counter n-day vulnerabilities. Minimizing permissions and promptly detecting
abnormal behavior, on the other hand, can help manage zero-day exploits. Companies should also
familiarize themselves with prominent infostealers and e-skimmers and adapt security controls to their
respective delivery methods, such as phishing and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in e-commerce
platforms. In the long term, investing in threat intelligence can help security teams remain aware of and
capable of responding to the latest TTPs.

## Key Findings

* The five most-referenced vulnerabilities in our dataset in H1 2024 were three vulnerabilities
affecting Ivanti Secure Connect, a vulnerability in PAN-OS, and a vulnerability in Microsoft
Windows SmartScreen.

* These vulnerabilities were initially exploited as zero-days by state-sponsored actors, with
targeting by cybercriminals persisting after the release of patches, almost certainly fueled by the
availability of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code.

* Infostealers remained the dominant malware category in the first half of 2024. LummaC2 was
the most prevalent of this type of malware, based on Recorded Future's Malware Intelligence
data.

* Updates to ransomware, trojans, infostealers, and malware loaders focused on hindering
analysis and evading detection through H1 2024, by updating existing TTPs and introducing new
ones.

* The operators of Fog, RansomHub, and 3AM, three relatively new ransomware strains, adopted
passwords as a means to validate their payload's execution and avoid analysis by sandbox and
other security solutions.

* Malware like Raspberry Robin, SocGholish, and HijackLoader implemented new anti-emulation,
execution, and process hollowing techniques. ClearFake, RedLine, and Coyote experimented
with new delivery techniques featuring the use of less-popular programming languages and
software tools.

* Magecart infections increased by approximately 103% between H2 2023 and H1 2024, based on
statistics from Recorded Future's Payment Fraud Intelligence module. We assess that factors like
the exploitation of a newly discovered vulnerability in Adobe Commerce (CVE-2024-20720), and
the debut of a new Magecart skimmer dubbed “Sniffer By Fleras” were partially responsible for
the upward trend.

## Vulnerability Exploitation Trends

The first half of 2024 was dominated by the exploitation of five vulnerabilities affecting widely adopted
security and remote access software. These were three vulnerabilities affecting Ivanti Secure Connect
(formerly Pulse Secure), one vulnerability affecting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS, and one vulnerability
affecting Microsoft Windows SmartScreen. Additional information on each of these vulnerabilities is
provided in Table 1 below.
