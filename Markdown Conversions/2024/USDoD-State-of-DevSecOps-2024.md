## Foreword

The Department of Defense (DoD) is embracing innovative software approaches to deliver resilient software capability at the speed of relevance. A shift toward Agile and DevSecOps and away from traditional waterfall approaches has been underway and is rapidly accelerating. This shift is crucial for maintaining our lethal force and building flexibility, security, and resiliency in our software delivery practices.

Agile software methodology is the foundation of modern software development. Software developers frustrated with the pace and unpredictability of legacy processes realized there was a better way to deliver software faster and more predictably by breaking down silos, developing software incrementally, creating feedback loops, and quickly delivering a “minimum viable product” for fast feedback. The Agile revolution transformed commercial software development and led to a burst of innovation in automation and tools.

The acceleration of software development led to the discipline of DevOps that focused on the need to both develop (Dev) and transition software into operations (Ops).

DoD’s unique mission compels programs to raise security to an equal footing with development and operations. DevSecOps is a combination of software engineering methodologies, practices, and tools that unifies software development (Dev), security (Sec), and operations (Ops). It emphasizes collaboration across these disciplines, along with automation and continuous monitoring to support the delivery of secure, high-quality software. DevSecOps integrates security tools and practices into the development pipeline, emphasizes the automation of processes, and fosters a culture of shared responsibility for performance, security, and operational integrity throughout the entire software lifecycle, from development to deployment and beyond. The concepts build upon the modern technology trends of the past two decades:

- The shift from waterfall software development methodology to Agile
- The transition from tightly coupled monolithic systems to loosely coupled modular services
- Integration of security across the lifecycle of technology
- Incorporation of testing throughout the software lifecycle
- Evolution from traditional data centers to cloud

The DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals, along with other supporting guidance available at [https://dodcio.defense.gov/library/](https://dodcio.defense.gov/library/), provides education, best practices, and implementation and operational guidance for information technology (IT) capability providers, IT capability consumers, product teams, and Authorizing Officials (AO). It is intended to build a community that understands the realm of the possible and is motivated to pursue the possible to enable a warfighting force strengthened by software.

# 1 Introduction

The Department of Defense is on a multi-year journey to fundamentally transform how software is built, used, and managed across all aspects of the DOD enterprise. This includes business systems, weapons systems, embedded software, and essential command and control and warfighting support systems. This transformation is essential to maintain the technology advantage that underpins US military capability. The DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals recognizes the importance of software. This document is an educational compendium of DevSecOps concepts and is intended to promote the adoption of modern software practices across the Department. Additional information is captured in corresponding guidance available at [https://dodcio.defense.gov/library/](https://dodcio.defense.gov/library/).

Each DoD organization is expected to tailor its culture and align DevSecOps practices to their own unique processes, products, security requirements, and operational procedures, while leveraging DoD Enterprise resources as a first preference, and making reasonable efforts to ensure developed solutions are re-usable across DoD organizations. Embracing DevSecOps requires organizations to shift their culture, evolve existing processes, adopt new technologies, and strengthen governance.

The intended audience of this document includes novice and intermediate staff who have recently adopted or anticipate adopting DevSecOps as well as DoD managers and leadership who need to understand the software transformation underway and how it will impact their mission. Expert practitioners may find value in this material as a refresher.

The document is organized in the following manner:

- **Section 1.0: Introduction**
  Provides a brief introduction and includes assumptions related to the concepts of DevSecOps.
- **Section 2.0: Defining DevSecOps**
  Provides the definition of DevSecOps and a description of the DevSecOps lifecycle and phases.
- **Section 3.0: Implementing DevSecOps**
  Provides in-depth information regarding the components of DevSecOps to include DevSecOps integration with other processes.
- **Section 4.0: Institutionalizing DevSecOps**
  Provides guidance regarding a DevSecOps culture and metrics.
- **Section 5.0: Getting Started**
  Provides next steps and identifies additional resources to support a DevSecOps journey.

## 1.1 Assumptions

The DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals makes the following assumptions:

- Agile/iterative software development practices have been implemented. The concepts in this document take those practices to the next step in maturity by implementing DevSecOps.
- Organizations deploying new business solutions or modernizing existing software systems will use an approved or provisionally authorized (PA) cloud environment as their preferred solution.
- For weapons systems, the environment will leverage cloud along with on-premises capabilities that facilitate hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testing for embedded systems.
- Cybersecurity elements will leverage cloud service provider (CSP) managed service capabilities where practicable. Teams will aggressively seek to integrate automated feedback, patching, alerting, and other authorized network security measures.
- Rapidly changing technology dictates designing DevSecOps pipelines and patterns for flexibility as new development capabilities enter/exit the commercial product market.
- DoD Components acknowledge a lock-in posture and recognize that vendor lock-in as well as product, version, architecture, platform, skills, legal, and mental lock-in also exist. Avoiding vendor lock-in without considering other types of lock-in is ill-advised.
- DevSecOps may be leveraged for any type of operational requirement needing software capabilities.

# 2 Defining DevSecOps

## 2.1 Definition

DevSecOps is a combination of software engineering methodologies, practices, and tools that unifies software development (Dev), security (Sec), and operations (Ops).

DevSecOps emphasizes collaboration across these disciplines, along with automation and continuous monitoring to support the delivery of secure, high-quality software. DevSecOps integrates security tools and practices into the development pipeline, emphasizes the automation of processes, and fosters a culture of shared responsibility for performance, security, and operational integrity throughout the entire software lifecycle, from development to deployment and beyond. Figure 1 visually depicts the DevSecOps lifecycle as an iterative infinity loop divided into ten distinct phases.

![DevSecOps Lifecycle Phases (Infinity Loop)](Figure 1: DevSecOps Lifecycle Phases (Infinity Loop))

DevSecOps is iterative by design, recognizing that software is never done. The serial-style delivery of the waterfall process is replaced with small, frequent deliveries that make it easier to change course as necessary. Each small delivery is accomplished through a fully automated process or semi-automated process with minimal human intervention to accelerate continuous integration and continuous deployment. This lifecycle is adaptable and includes numerous feedback loops that drive continuous process improvements.

## 2.2 DevSecOps Lifecycle

The DevSecOps lifecycle consists of ten phases. The ten phases group common activities and any quality gates that occur at that point in the lifecycle and proceed in a cyclical manner with the result of a cycle being a software product release. A software product release is an iteration of the product that includes new functionality, performance enhancements, and/or security improvements. Each cycle builds upon the results of previous cycles. The duration of the cycle is determined by the mission owner in response to the needs of the stakeholders. Some phase activities may start in one phase and continue throughout additional phases of the lifecycle. The ten phases are defined below with specific activities for each phase enumerated in the DevSecOps Fundamentals Guidebook: DevSecOps Activities & Tools.[^1]

1.  **Plan** – Define the requirements and objectives of the product, with the greatest focus on the contents of the next release or version.
2.  **Develop** – Create the elements of the product based upon the requirements and objectives identified in the Plan phase.
3.  **Build** – Compile and/or integrate the new elements with any existing elements of the product.
4.  **Test** – Verify that the new elements meet requirements and objectives.
5.  **Release** – Package the product and create required documentation.
6.  **Deliver** – Make the product available to the operational environment.
7.  **Deploy** – Install and/or configure the product within the operational environment.
8.  **Operate** – Use the product in the operational environment.
9.  **Monitor** – Observe, measure, and monitor the product as it is used.
10. **Feedback** – Transmit observed behavior and desired changes for consideration in the next iteration of the software product.

## 2.3 Key Concepts

There are fundamental concepts associated with adopting DevSecOps. These concepts are described in Table 1 and are detailed in the sections that follow.

towards a continuous risk determination and authorization concept by continuously assessing,
monitoring, and managing risk. cATO raises the security standard over a traditional Authorization to
Operate (ATO) and provides the ability to deploy updated software more rapidly while improving
security. cATO includes the need for a Secure Software Supply Chain (SSSC) and requires a Software
Bill of Materials (SBOM).  Further information about cATO is available in the DevSecOps Continuous
Authorization Implementation Guide.5

3.3.2

Test and Evaluation

While the DevSecOps lifecycle includes a phase named “Test,” there are testing activities throughout
the lifecycle, whether by securing the software supply chain or by adopting practices in alignment with
NIST SP 800-218. These testing activities are identified in Figure 12 and were developed in
coordination with the Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) and the Developmental Test and
Evaluation (DT&E) organizations and the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC). At a high level,
the two categories of testing are Functional Testing and Security Testing. The DevSecOps
Fundamentals Guidebook: DevSecOps Activities & Tools contains more details about the different tests
to include throughout the lifecycle and maps the tests to the SSDF.

Functional Testing: Functional testing is essential to DevSecOps, as it ensures that each product
increment functions as intended. Integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, functional testing validates the
behavior of individual components, modules, and the entire system, simulating real-world scenarios to
confirm correct operation under various conditions. Tailoring the DevSecOps Fundamentals
Guidebook: DevSecOps Activities & Tools to each mission could result in additional testing activities.

Security Testing: There is no “one size fits all” solution for security testing design. Each product team
has its own unique requirements and constraints. However, the software artifact promotion control
gates are a best practice of the software factory. Different pipelines within the software factory may
define different collections of tests to maximize the effectiveness of a control gate.

3.3.3  Acquisition

Traditionally, the DoD acquisition process for software applications was lengthy and expensive, taking
years and millions of dollars to deploy systems. With the adoption of Agile and DevSecOps and the use
of the DoD Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), the acquisition process can be streamlined and
accelerated. This alignment between SWP and DevSecOps provides for the efficient and effective
acquisition, development, integration, and timely delivery of secure software.6 Refer to DoDI 5000.87
for the steps in the SWP.

4  Institutionalizing DevSecOps

4.1  DevSecOps Culture and Philosophy

DORA’s 2023 State of DevOps Report established that a healthy, generative culture is instrumental in
driving not only organizational performance but also software delivery and operational efficiency. Key to
this is the cultivation of an environment where information flows freely, reducing knowledge silos and
enhancing the effectiveness of task execution.

Their findings identified that culture drives organizational performance in teams with a generative
culture delivering a 30% higher organization performance than teams without. They found that “the
relationship between culture and technical capabilities is reciprocal: culture emerges from practices,
and practices emerge from culture.” Other findings include the following:

•  User-Centered Approach: A significant revelation is the impact of a user-centered approach in

software development. By prioritizing user needs and feedback, organizations witness
increased user satisfaction and a better user experience.

•  Work Distribution and Team Performance: The report finds that equitable work distribution

correlates positively with team and organizational performance. However, it suggests that overly
formalized processes in work distribution might hinder software delivery performance, indicating
a need for balanced and flexible work management practices within DevSecOps frameworks.

•  Organizational Stability vs. Agility: An interesting observation is the slight decrease in

software delivery performance in more stable, established organizations. This observation could
imply a need for established organizations to foster a culture of agility and innovation to keep
pace with rapidly evolving cybersecurity and operational demands.

•

Information Sharing and Operational Performance: The findings highlight the importance of
open information sharing, which is directly linked to improved software delivery and operational
performance. In DevSecOps, this translates to transparent communication and collaboration
across all stages of the development lifecycle.

•  Flexibility in Work Arrangements: The report underscores the benefits of flexible work

arrangements across all performance metrics, particularly in software delivery. As organizations
navigate remote work policies, maintaining a degree of flexibility can be advantageous.

•  Employee Well-being: Lastly, the report emphasizes that a healthy culture is foundational to
employee well-being, reducing burnout, and increasing job satisfaction and productivity. In the
context of DevSecOps, investing in a positive culture is not just beneficial but essential for the
overall health and success of the organization.

There are several tenets for a successful transition to a DevSecOps culture:

•  Continuous delivery of small incremental changes.

•

Include security from the beginning rather than bolt it on at the end.

•  Value open source software.

•  Engage users early and often.

•  Prefer user centered and warfighter focus and design.

24

•  Value automating repeated manual processes to the maximum extent possible.

•  Fail fast, learn fast, but don’t fail twice for the same reason.

•  Fail responsibly; fail forward.

•  Treat every API as a first-class citizen.

•  Good code always has documentation as close to the code as possible.

•  Recognize the strategic value of data; ensure its potential is not unintentionally compromised.

4.2  A Whole-of-DoD Approach

Driving true transformational change in the DoD towards Agile and DevSecOps practices for software
development and delivery requires holistic organizational change encompassing people, processes,
and technology. To ensure success, we must radically shift our organizational culture away from
traditional waterfall methodologies and processes and break down silos to foster collaboration. These
efforts are the foundation needed for critical advancements such as artificial intelligence and machine
learning.

A whole-of-DoD approach involves a comprehensive and coordinated effort across the Department to
embrace and integrate modern software development practices such as Agile and DevSecOps.

Leadership and Culture:

•  Leadership commitment: Senior leaders within the DoD must demonstrate a strong commitment
to modern software practices and actively promote their adoption throughout the organization.

•  Organizational patience: DevSecOps has been proven on programs across the Department, but

there have also been DevSecOps programs that have not been successful. This is not a
reflection of the technological approach, but rather the complexity of building software in the
Department with many authorities and decision makers that determine the fate of a program.

•  Cultural shift: There needs to be a cultural shift towards embracing agility, collaboration, and

continuous improvement. This includes breaking down silos, fostering cross-functional teams,
and promoting a culture of innovation and learning.

Workforce Development:

•  Training and education: Provide training programs and resources to upskill the workforce in

modern software practices, including Agile methodologies, DevSecOps principles, and relevant
technologies.

•  Career paths: Establish clear career paths and development opportunities for software

professionals, including roles specific to Agile and DevSecOps, to attract and retain top talent.

Management and Governance:

•

“Top-down” and “bottom-up:” The management objective of DevSecOps must be both “top-
down” and “bottom-up” to balance the larger strategic goals of software modernization across
the DoD. Senior leader buy-in is crucial for success, though buy-in at the staff level is equally
important. This engenders a sense of ownership, which encourages the appropriate

25

implementation of processes related to governance and enables team members to support
continuous process improvement.

•  Governance frameworks: Develop governance frameworks that align with modern software

practices, ensuring compliance, risk management, and accountability while enabling agility and
innovation.

•

Inherent Accountability: Push down or delegate responsibility to the lowest level for more
effective and efficient decision-making.

Collaboration and Partnerships:

•  Cross-functional collaboration: Foster collaboration and communication between development,

security, operations, end users, and other relevant stakeholders to break down silos and
promote shared responsibility for software development, security, and capability delivery.

•  Public-private partnerships: Establish partnerships with industry, academia, and other

government agencies to leverage best practices, share knowledge, and drive innovation in
software development.

Continuous Improvement and Measurement:

•  Metrics and feedback loops: Define and track key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the

effectiveness of modern software practices and identify areas for improvement. Establish
feedback loops to gather insights from users, stakeholders, and the development teams to drive
continuous improvement.

By adopting a whole-of-DoD approach, the Department can create an environment that supports the
successful implementation of modern software practices. This approach ensures alignment across the
organization, promotes collaboration, and enables the DoD to deliver secure, resilient, and innovative
software capabilities at the speed of relevance.

4.3  Measuring Success with Performance Metrics

Metrics are crucial to software development, delivery, and operations as they provide objective and
quantifiable measures of performance, progress, and quality. By tracking and analyzing metrics,
organizations can gain valuable insights into the efficiency, effectiveness, and health of their software
development processes. Metrics help identify bottlenecks, measure productivity, and assess the impact
of process improvements. They enable teams to make data-driven decisions, set realistic goals, and
continuously improve their practices. Metrics also facilitate communication and transparency, allowing
stakeholders to understand the status of projects, identify risks, and make informed decisions.
Ultimately, metrics empower organizations to optimize their software development and delivery
processes, enhance customer satisfaction, and achieve better outcomes.

Aggregation of performance metrics is accomplished by querying data from multiple tools across the
software factory and is most often accomplished using existing tool APIs. Most git repositories have
documented APIs to query how often an artifact is pulled from a main branch, for example. If you have
successfully automated deployment, you can pull the deployment metrics from your automation stack.

26

4.3.1  DORA and Google Metrics

The 2023 State of DevOps Report, compiled by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) and
Google Cloud, investigates the capabilities and measures of high-performing technology-driven
organizations. The DORA research for 2023 looked at the following:

•  Organizational performance – The organization should produce not only revenue, but value for

customers, as well as for the extended community.

•  Team performance – The ability for an application or service team to create value, innovate, and

collaborate.

•  Employee well-being – The strategies an organization or team adopts should benefit the

employees – reduce burnout, foster a satisfying job experience, and increase people’s ability to
produce valuable outputs.

They also researched performance measures for the following:

•  Software delivery performance – Teams can safely, quickly, and efficiently change their

technology systems. The following four metrics measure the speed and stability of software
delivery:

o  Deployment Frequency – how frequently changes are pushed to production.

o  Change Lead Time – how long it takes a change to go from committed to deployed.

o  Change Failure Rate – how frequently a deployment introduces a failure that requires

immediate intervention.

o  Failed Deployment Recovery Time – how long it takes to recover from a failed

deployment.

•  Operational performance – The service provides a reliable experience for its users. This is the
extent to which a service can meet the expectations of its users and includes measures like
availability and performance.

Another set of metrics that have value for measuring day to day operations are Google’s Four
Golden Signals.7 These metrics have a higher value for platform operators than for developers
or security team members. However, they are very useful for developers to measure application
performance and for security teams to identify abnormalities that may point to a concern.

o  Latency – the time it takes to service a request.

o  Traffic – how much demand is being placed on your system.

o  Errors – rate of requests that fail.

o  Saturation – how “full” is your service (storage, compute, and bandwidth).

7 The Four Golden Signals, [Online]. Available: https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-
systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals.

27

•  Reliability targets – The extent to which a service meets its stated goals for measures like

availability, performance, and correctness.

OUSD(A&S) has defined the DoD4 which is an expansion of the DORA 4 and includes the following:

•  Delivery Speed and Cadence: Lead Time and Deployment Frequency

•  Stability & Reliability: MTTR, Deployment Failure Rate

•  Value/ROI: Value produced (and associated costs) – tailored to mission threads/stakeholders

•  Cyber Resilience: Time to detect/resolve cyber event and average time to achieve ATO

Additional metrics guidance is available from OUSD(A&S) at https://aaf.dau.edu/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/Agile-Metrics-Guide.pdf. Software Acquisition Pathway metrics are available
at https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/software/metrics-and-reporting/.

4.3.2  Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. OKRs are a methodology for settings goals and tracking
results. It started with Peter Drucker who introduced Management by Objectives in 1954. It was
improved upon by Andy Grove at Intel in the 1970s by adding the Key Results. Google adopted OKRs
in 1999. The goal of OKRs is to focus on what matters. A current DoD example using OKRs is Platform
One. Some metrics from Platform One include the following:

•  Objective: Expand the delivery of Platform One products and services to the warfighter.

o  Result: 100% automatic Big Bang edge instance deployments and upgrades via cloud

distribution.

•  Objective: Win the hearts and minds of current customers through enhanced product

experiences.

o  Result: Reduce Big Bang release cycle from 2 weeks to 24 hours with upgrade paths

avoiding customer downtime.

o  Result: Consolidate CNAP clusters 50% to increase maintainability and decrease attack

surface.

4.3.3

Flow Metrics

Flow metrics are a set of quantitative measures used to assess the flow of work through a software
development or delivery process. They provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the
process, helping teams identify bottlenecks, optimize workflow, and improve overall productivity. Flow
metrics focus on the movement of work items from one stage to another, tracking the time taken at
each stage and the rate at which work items progress through the process.

Some common flow metrics include the following:

1.  Cycle Time: Cycle time measures the time taken for a work item to move from the start to the
end of the process. It provides an indication of how quickly work is completed and can help
identify areas where delays occur.

28

2.  Throughput: Throughput measures the rate at which work items are completed within a given
time period. It provides an understanding of the team's capacity to deliver work and can help
identify potential bottlenecks or constraints.

3.  Work in Progress (WIP): WIP measures the number of work items that are actively being
worked on at any given time. It helps teams understand the amount of work they have in
progress and can be used to manage and balance workloads.

By tracking and analyzing flow metrics, teams can identify areas for improvement, optimize their
processes, and make data-driven decisions to enhance productivity and delivery speed. Flow metrics
are often used in conjunction with other metrics and practices, such as Kanban or Lean methodologies,
to create a more efficient and streamlined software development or delivery process.

4.4  Workforce

A critical component in institutionalizing software practices like DevSecOps is people. There must be a
skilled workforce to power software factories and DevSecOps platforms.

A software product team typically consists of a group of individuals who work together to develop and
deliver a specific product or feature. The team is typically cross-functional, meaning that each member
brings a unique skillset or expertise. This allows for efficient collaboration, quick decision-making, and
the ability to deliver a product that meets customer needs within a shorter timeframe. A small team size
promotes a sense of ownership, accountability, and close collaboration among team members, leading
to a more agile and responsive development process (see Figure 13).  On highly functional teams, a
given individual might execute in multiple roles, and that the nature of a cross-functional team means
that this is not only allowable, but to be encouraged.

1.  Product Manager: The product manager is responsible for defining the product vision, strategy,
and roadmap. They gather requirements, prioritize features, and ensure that the product aligns
with customer needs and business goals.

2.  Software Developer: Software Developers are responsible for writing code and developing the
software product. They work closely with other team members to implement features, fix bugs,
and ensure the product meets quality standards.

3.  UX/UI Designer: The UI designer focuses on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing

interface for the product. The UX designer manages the user experience of a product focused
on human factors by making products intuitive and maximizing usability, accessibility, and
simplicity.

4.  Security Engineer: Security Engineers are responsible for analysis and development of

systems/software security throughout the product lifecycle to include integration, operations,
and maintenance.

5.  Test Engineer: Test Engineers plan, prepare, and perform testing, evaluation, verification, and
validation of software to evaluate results against specifications, requirements, and operational
need.

6.  Data Scientist/Engineer: Data Scientists/Engineers gather and analyze data to provide

insights into user behavior, product performance, and market trends. They help inform decision-
making and drive data-driven improvements to the product.

29

7.  DevSecOps Specialist/Site Reliability Engineer: DevSecOps Specialists/Site Reliability

Engineers focus on the integration of development and operations processes. They
select/deploy/maintain the set of CI/CD tools and processes used by the development team
and/or maintain the deployed software product and ensure observability and security across the
lifecycle.

8.  Software/Cloud Architect: Software/Cloud Architects manage and identify product high-level
technical specifications, which may include application design, cloud computing strategy and
adoption, and integration of software applications into a function system to meet requirements.

Figure 13: Roles for a Smaller Product Team

Depending on the specific needs of the product, the team may also include and is not limited to other
roles such as an Agile Coach, business analyst, technical writer, or customer support representative.

There are additional roles that may impact the software product team. They include the
Warfighter/User, Mission Owner, Authorizing Official, Program Executive Officer (PEO), Program
Manager, Sponsor, Financial Manager, Cost Analyst, Contracting Officer, Human Resources Specialist,
Product Support Manager, and Intel/Threat Analyst.

4.5  DevSecOps Community

In April 2019, DoD conducted the first monthly DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Community of Practice
(DSO CoP). The DSO CoP is a monthly meeting where practitioners from across DoD, academia, and
industry gather to learn, exchange success stories and innovative ideas, educate members, raise
issues to the greater DevSecOps community, and collaborate to resolve issues. The community
reduces silos and enhances knowledge building across the Department by encouraging participation

30

and partnerships and by staying connected to centers of excellence and pioneer implementers. To
become a member of the DSO CoP, contact: osd.mc-alex.dod-cio.mbx.devsecops@mail.mil.

5  Getting Started

This document introduces DevSecOps – its definition, implementation, and institutionalization.

Adoption of DevSecOps and its methodologies and technical tools must be likened to a marathon, not a
sprint. In more direct terms, comprehension of this document’s material is the starting point, not the
destination. Practitioners must demonstrate an insatiable thirst for knowledge to accept constructive
criticism from their teammates, and indirectly from their individual and team performance metrics.

Artifact Repository

An artifact repository is a system for storage, retrieval, and
management of artifacts and their associated metadata.

Code

Configuration
Management

Container

Continuous
Authorization to Operate

Continuous Build

Note that programs may have separate artifact repositories to store
local artifacts and released artifacts. It is also possible to have a single
artifact repository and use tags to distinguish the content types.

The process workflows and associated tools to achieve the continuous
integration and continuous deployment of software with maximum use
of automation.

Software instructions for a computer, written in a programming
language. These instructions may be in the form of either human-
readable source code, or machine code, which is source code that has
been compiled into machine executable instructions.

Capability to establish and maintain a specific configuration within
operating systems and applications.

A standard unit of software that packages up code and all its
dependencies, down to, but not including the OS. It is a lightweight,
standalone, executable package of software that includes everything
needed to run an application except the OS: code, runtime, system
tools, system libraries and settings.

cATO is the state achieved when the organization that develops,
secures, and operates a system has demonstrated sufficient maturity in
their ability to maintain a resilient cybersecurity posture that traditional
risk assessments and authorizations become redundant. This
organization must have implemented robust information security
continuous monitoring capabilities, active cyber defense, and secure
software supply chain requirements to enable continuous delivery of
capabilities without adversely impacting the system’s cyber posture

Continuous build is an automated process to compile and build
software source code into artifacts. The common activities in the
continuous build process include compiling code, running static code
analysis such as code style checking, binary linking (in the case of
languages such as C++), and executing unit tests. The outputs from
continuous build process are build results, build reports (e.g., the unit
test report, and a static code analysis report), and artifacts stored into
Artifact Repository. The trigger to this process could be a developer
code commit or a code merge of a branch into the main trunk.

34

Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration to ensure
that a team can release the software changes to production quickly and
in a sustainable way.

The additional activities involved in continuous integration include
release control gate validation and storing the artifacts in the artifact
repository, which may be different than the build artifact repository.

The trigger to these additional activities is successful integration, which
means all automation tests and security scans have been passed.

The human input from the manual test and security activities should be
included in the release control gate.

The outputs of continuous delivery are a release go/no-go decision and
released artifacts, if the decision is to release.

Continuous Deployment  Continuous deployment is an extension of continuous delivery. It is
triggered by a successful delivery of released artifacts to the artifact
repository.

The additional activities for continuous deployment include, but are not
limited to, deploying a new release to the production environment,
running a smoke test to make sure essential functionality is working,
and a security scan.

The output of continuous deployment includes the deployment status.
In the case of a successful deployment, it also provides a new software
release running in production. On the other hand, a failed deployment
causes a rollback to the previous release.

Continuous integration goes one step further than continuous build. It
extends continuous build with more automated tests and security
scans. Any test or security activities that require human intervention
can be managed by separate process flows.

The automated tests include, but are not limited to, integration tests, a
system test, and regression tests. The security scans include, but are
not limited to, dynamic code analysis, test coverage, dependency/BOM
checking, and compliance checking.

The outputs from continuous integration include the continuous build
outputs, plus automation test results and security scan results.

The trigger to the automated tests and security scan is a successful
build.

Continuous monitoring is an extension to continuous operation. It
continuously monitors and inventories all system components, monitors
the performance and security of all the components, and audits & logs
the system events.

Immutable infrastructure

Continuous operation is an extension to continuous deployment. It is
triggered by a successful deployment. The production environment
operates continuously with the latest stable software release.

The activities of continuous operation include, but are not limited to:
system patching, compliance scanning, data backup, and resource
optimization with load balancing and scaling (both horizontal and
vertical).

A control gate is a point in the software lifecycle process when the code
is evaluated, and a decision is made to proceed or stop progress.
Control gates can contain automated and manual checks.

The process by which a released software is placed into an artifact
repository that operational environment can download.

The process by which the released software is downloaded and
deployed to the production environment.

DevSecOps is a combination of software engineering methodologies,
practices, and tools that unifies software development (Dev), security
(Sec), and operations (Ops). It emphasizes collaboration across these
disciplines, along with automation and continuous monitoring to support
the delivery of secure, high-quality software. DevSecOps integrates
security tools and practices into the development pipeline, emphasizes
the automation of processes, and fosters a culture of shared
responsibility for performance, security, and operational integrity
throughout the entire software lifecycle, from development to
deployment and beyond.

A DevSecOps platform is defined as a group of resources and
capabilities that form a base upon which other capabilities or services
are built and operated within the same technical framework. Use of a
DevSecOps platform is encouraged to accelerate development,
delivery, and cybersecurity accreditation

Software with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or
electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints, or
software applications embedded in a platform (e.g., air vehicle, ground
vehicle, or ship). DoDI 5000.87

Immutable infrastructure refers to computer infrastructure (virtual
machines, containers, network appliances) that cannot be changed
once deployed.

Containers are a good example because persistent changes to
containers can only be made by creating a new version of the container
or recreating the existing container from its image.

 (from: https://glossary.cncf.io/immutable-infrastructure/)

Infrastructure as Code

The management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load
balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the
same versioning that the DevSecOps team uses for source code.

Holds the hardened container images of DevSecOps components that
DoD mission software teams can utilize to instantiate their own
DevSecOps pipeline. It also holds the hardened containers for base
operating systems, web servers, application servers, databases, API
gateways, message busses for use by DoD mission software teams as
a mission system deployment baseline. These hardened containers,
along with security accreditation reciprocity, greatly simplifies and
speeds the process of obtaining an Approval to Connect (ATC) or
Authority to Operate (ATO).

An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and
management of containerized applications. It was originally designed
by Google and is now maintained by the CNCF. Many vendors also
provide their own branded Kubernetes. It works with a range of
container runtimes. Many cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based
platform as a service.

Microservices are both an architecture and an approach to software
development in which a monolith application is broken down into a suite
of loosely coupled independent services that can be altered, updated,
or taken down without affecting the rest of the application.

A central place in which data is aggregated and maintained in an
organized way.

A software artifact is a tangible machine-readable document created
during software development. (ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2017)

A software factory is defined as a collection of people, tools, and
processes that enables teams to continuously deliver value by
deploying software to meet the needs of a specific community of end
users. It leverages automation to replace manual processes.

Software Supply Chain

The software supply chain is a collection of steps that create,
transform, and assess the quality and policy conformance of software
artifacts. (NIST SP 800-204D)
