## Introduction

S&P Global Market Intelligence, commissioned by Thales.

As economic uncertainty continues and the threat landscape grows more complex, enterprises are working to 
address increasing regulatory mandates while improving their security posture. The 2024 Thales Global Data 
Threat Report (DTR) offers insights into new technologies, their security implications and the organizational 
changes for success ahead. The report analyzes global trends in threats to data and the underlying controls, 
regulations, risks and emerging technologies that need to be addressed. The report reflects insights from 
nearly 3,000 respondents at the individual contributor, managerial and executive levels from 18 countries 
across 37 industries and explores their data security experiences, challenges, strategies and outcomes. 

## Securing Opportunities Ahead
The 2024 Data Threat Report (DTR) analyzes how core security practices have changed in response to or in 
anticipation of changing threats. This report also offers perspectives on what organizations can do to leverage data 
assets to expand opportunities to make their businesses more agile and build trust with their customers. 

The diversity of internal and external stakeholders indicates that security initiatives must consider those parties that 
interpret, implement and live by policies, rules and controls. These initiatives span various contexts and may have 
multiple motivations, such as securing cloud environments to scale capacity or ensuring compliance with regulatory 
and data sovereignty requirements. This report offers perspectives on what is taking place and what is possible in 
regards to these challenges.

Market uncertainty, new regulatory requirements, and geopolitical tensions have added further stresses to what has 
always been a complex endeavor. In July 2023, the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission announced rules requiring 
registrants, including both U.S. and foreign private issuers, to disclose material security events. In the same month, the EU 
adopted the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). The DPF faces similar EU legal challenges as its predecessors Privacy 
Shield Framework (2015) and US-EU Safe Harbor Framework (2000), adding greater uncertainty for enterprises.

Increases in threats and shifts in threat types have motivated these regulations. According to the findings in the 2024 
DTR, the vast majority (93%) of enterprises reported an increase in threats. They identified malware, phishing and 
ransomware as the fastest growing attacks, respectively chosen by 41%, 36% and 32% of respondents, and they 
reported cloud assets such as SaaS applications, cloud-based storage, and cloud infrastructure management as the 
biggest targets for attack. Human factors are still a major cause of cloud data breaches, with user error as the leading 
cause at 31% and failure to apply multi-factor authentication (MFA) to privileged accounts also a significant factor at 17%. 
This year’s report looks closely at these human factors by considering both workforce identity and access management 
(workforce IAM) and customer identity and access management (CIAM). 

Because of these challenges, information security spending remains strong: 93% of respondents are increasing their 
budgets, according to 451 Research’s Voice of the Enterprise: Information Security, Budgets & Outlook 2023.

Recent innovations in quantum computing, cloud computing, external user experience (UX), and generative artificial 
intelligence (GenAI) have captured the industry’s imagination. This report considers both securing the use of GenAI 
and using GenAI to better secure the enterprise. Differing priorities from different functional leaders and external 
stakeholders will require security and risk management leaders to build stronger relationships. 

While enterprises further pursue these new technologies, data security hygiene challenges are a barrier to better adoption.

For the last 4 years, at least 1 in 6 enterprise respondents 
said that they have been able to classify very little or no data. 1 in 6
Fundamental understanding of what systems, applications and data are at risk from changing regulatory and threat 
landscapes continues to lag. For the last four years, at least one in six enterprise respondents said that they have 
been able to classify very little or no data. While sensitive data discovery and classification is the top-cited security 
technology that managers plan to implement in the next 12 months, according to 451 Research’s Voice of the 
Enterprise: Information Security, Technology Roadmap 2023 report, enterprises will need to improve their standing to 
better adopt new technologies in 5G/IoT and cloud among sovereign and external stakeholders.

This year’s study also examines how and why technologies are chosen. These insights can better guide enterprises 
toward successful and secure adoption.

## Key Findings
### Data Breach Trends and Threats
- 49% of organizations reported being breached sometime in their history, but recent breach history has decreased from 24% in 2021 to 15% in 2024.
- Ransomware attacks are more common, with 28% experiencing an attack (up from 22% last year), but planning is still poor, with only 21% saying they would follow a formal plan in the event of an attack.
- Human factors are still a major cause of cloud data breaches; human error was the leading cause with 31%, and failure to apply MFA to privileged accounts constituted another 17%.
- Multicloud growth is flattening, but financial services firms are now slightly more multicloud (2.03 cloud providers on average) than the average enterprise survey-wide (2.02 cloud providers).

### Risks to Emerging Technologies
- The generative AI boom is underway: 22% plan to integrate GenAI into products/services in the next 12 months, and 33% are going to experiment with integrating the technology.
- Security of data over 5G networks was the number one concern for nearly two-thirds (65%).
- Prototyping post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is said to be the primary approach (52%) to address the future compromise of classical encryption techniques. “Harvest now, decrypt later” attacks (68%) are leading interest in PQC.

### Identity Complexities and Compromise
- The breadth of external customer identities accessing enterprise networks is high; on average, one-sixth (16%) of all access is by customers.
- Achieving security consistency within CIAM initiatives was the number one cited challenge (62%).

### Increasing DevOps Challenges
- Secrets Management (56%) is the number one DevOps challenge, followed closely by workforce IAM challenges such as privileged user management (52%).
- Over half (53%) have implemented a formal security champions program as part of a DevSecOps program.
- Operational complexity remains a security concern. While the number of respondents reporting five or more key management systems is down (53% versus 62% last year), the average number declined only slightly (from 5.6 to 5.4 key management systems).

### Compliance and Sovereignty Concerns
- Almost 70% of Enterprises are able to classify only 50% or less of their sensitive data.
- Mandatory external key management is the leading way to achieve sovereignty (28%).

## Enterprise Observations
Correlation – Compliance and Security Outcomes

![Chart showing the correlation between compliance audit results and breach history from 2021 to 2024]

This year’s DTR provides additional insights into the internal enterprise organization. The need for data security as a 
discipline remains diffused throughout the enterprise. Functions such as compliance, go-to-market, supply chain and 
design all incorporate data security. 

Security and compliance initiatives are converging as the two come together on inputs, processes and outcomes. 
Through the years, DTR findings have shown a stronger correlation between compliance achievement and reduced 
breaches. In 2024, of the respondents whose organizations failed a compliance audit, 84% reported having some 
breach in their history, with 31% saying they experienced a breach in the last 12 months. In contrast, for those that 
passed compliance audits, only 21% have a breach history and only 3% suffered a breach in the last 12 months.

Among respondents prioritizing DevSecOps, 38% said that their 
configuration, compliance and security controls were built into code. 38%

Compliance is arguably different than security, but many of the same techniques achieve beneficial outcomes in both. 
Regulatory oversight merges the distinctions between compliance and security diligence. Increasingly, compliance 
standards such as AICPA SOC2 Type 2 or ISO27K require that organizations demonstrate controls over time 
rather than at a single point in time. Automation will continue to drive improvement in this area. Among respondents 
prioritizing DevSecOps, 38% said that their configuration, compliance, and security controls were built into code. This 
report shares further insights on enabling developers and operators to achieve better security and service outcomes. 

This year’s key theme encourages security leaders to build stronger relationships by reconciling differences 
among internal and external enterprise stakeholders. Customers, developers and lines of business look to expand 
trustworthiness across new technologies and arenas such as GenAI, fintech, PQC, 5G and IoT. Study data shows 
progress is being made; greater demands and opportunities lie ahead. Internal pressures to manage costs conflict with 
efforts to mitigate attacks from more capable adversaries. Trust, safety, confidentiality, and privacy are now major 
factors in a business’s brand, and security leaders can use the report insights to build stronger alliances across their 
organizations to achieve a more proactive, dynamic risk-based approach to security management.

## The Threat Landscape
The attack landscape remains vast and is growing: 93% of respondents said they experienced an increase in 
attacks, with malware, ransomware and phishing consistently being the largest growth categories for 
attacks. 

### Increasing Attack Types
| # | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1 Threat Source | Malware | Malware | Malware | Malware |
| #2 Threat Source | Ransomware | Ransomware | Ransomware | Ransomware |
| #3 Threat Source | Phishing | Phishing | Phishing | Phishing |

### Top Threat Actors

| #2 Threat Actor | Human error | External attackers — hacktivists | External attackers — hacktivists | Human error |
| #3 Threat Actor | External attackers | External attackers — nation-state actors | External attackers — nation-state actors | External attackers — nation-state actors |

Ransomware response remains a challenge. For the last three years, less than 50% of respondents across 
all verticals and company sizes have a formal ransomware plan. Overall, one in five respondents said that, in 
the event of a ransomware attack, they paid or would pay the ransom. Initial breach response is increasingly led by 
legal teams interfacing with regulators or law enforcement. 

While some aspects of ransomware response have separate technical requirements, such as forensic isolation, 
continuous reliability and performance remain paramount concerns. Mutual beneficial opportunities in planning for 
incidents and responding to unplanned outages exist for both security practitioners and site reliability engineers (SRE). 
For security teams, partnering with SREs during the general design/architecture review process offers the chance to 
integrate security design. Explicit guidance, enablement and advice allow for SREs to definitively and proactively 
build in security best practices.

When characterizing threat actors, internal human error remains a critical threat area, always ranking 
highly, if not the top category. In 2024, 22% of respondents said that human error was the single most concerning 
threat, and 74% of respondents placed some level of priority on threats from human error. The industry must continue 
redirecting its efforts to more secure and user-friendly approaches. 

Innovations in cloud automation, developer experience, CIAM and workforce IAM reduce human errors and 
downstream consequences. Malicious adversaries are not only increasing the number of attacks but are also 
exhibiting growing sophistication in combining techniques. The ecosystems of ransomware creators, access brokers 
and criminal operators continue to evolve and adapt. While UX improves with new CIAM improvements such 
as passkeys and password deprecation, new challenges will arise such as deepfake attacks from generative AI. 
Simplifying this complexity reduces the missteps that adversaries can take advantage of and improves usability and 
engagement. 

This year’s DTR survey asked respondents to select their top four sources of security concerns among emerging 
technologies including cloud and DevSecOps, AI, Workforce IAM, IoT/5G, PQC and digital sovereignty. The results 
reflect broad concern in all emerging areas.

Greatest Sources of Concern for Security Programs

## Developing Customer Trust - CIAM
For enterprises, safeguarding external users is essential for building trust with their customers. Enterprises 
must secure their data to meet consumer expectations of privacy and security. 

According to the 2024 Thales Consumer Digital Trust Index Report, most customers (89%) are willing to share their 
data with organizations, but that comes with some non-negotiable caveats. More than four in five (87%) expect some 
level of privacy rights from the companies they interact with online.

In addition to high consumer expectations of privacy, DTR respondents reported that significant number of customers 
access their organization’s internal systems or assets. Respondents said up to 16% of those who access corporate 
cloud, network and device resources could be customers. Similarly, external vendor and contractor access 
accounted for an average of 15% and 12% of users, respectively. With high consumer expectations of privacy and 
significant amounts of external user access, CIAM emerges as one of the top security priorities.

The 2024 DTR also examines why respondents are concerned and how they will address those concerns. 
In each of the following sections, the report shares insights on specific areas of emerging concern.

Respondents reflected in multiple ways on the diversity and volume of customers, external contractors, partners and 
vendors accessing corporate systems, and the resulting effects on security complexity. This year’s study permitted 
write-in responses; two interesting responses to the prompt “Describe your specific CIAM challenges” addressed the 
complexity of trusting external users in the context of the organization’s broader needs:

Overall, security consistency was the greatest challenge, cited by 62% of respondents. The range of 
challenges to securely onboard external identities also matches the range of stakeholder involvement needed for 
successful CIAM initiatives. User friction, journey orchestration, privacy, anti-fraud know your customer (KYC), and 
developer experience challenges all reflect different stakeholders in UX, legal and development.

These CIAM challenges are compounding; high user friction or poor user experience makes identity verification 
(IDV) and KYC fulfillment more difficult. New threats such as GenAI deepfakes add new challenges to KYC, know 
your third party (KY3P) and IDV processes, and these threats further strain external identity management trust models 
based on user reputation 
rather than real-life identity. 
Challenging developer 
enablement leads to 
security inconsistencies. 
For example, inconsistent 
and arbitrary password 
complexity rules give a 
false sense of security while 
increasing user friction. 
Given the compounding 
nature of CIAM 
challenges, security 
teams should look 
to enable improved 
developer experiences.

Challenges with Securely Onboarding Customer Identities

## Developer Journey - Cloud and DevOps
Given the trend toward building in external trustworthiness, DTR respondents also shared their insights for building 
in cloud and DevOps environments. The need for security to be flexibly integrated into digital product or service 
design has never been higher, given the adoption of new technologies. This year, two-thirds of DTR respondents 
prioritized DevSecOps and cloud as their greatest emerging security concern. Their insights revealed successes 
and areas for improvement. 

Among emerging concerns, secrets management (56%) was the top challenge. Close behind was workforce 
IAM at 52%. Curiously, authorization (26%) was last on the list. 

For developers, these three challenges are related. Secrets management, authorization, and workforce IAM are all 
interrelated tasks and disciplines for both privileged operators and the workload life cycle they manage. Tools and 
techniques that enable developers to proactively define and implement these controls maximize security and software 
publishing efficacy.

![Chart showing the top-cited security challenges in DevOps]

Top-cited Security Challenges in DevOps

The difficulty with secrets is that they are frequently “bearer”-focused — that is, “bearer tokens” grant access to 
whoever bears or possesses, the token. When secrets are lost — written as cleartext environment variables in code, 
for example — consequences can be severe. Lost secrets such as signing keys used to authenticate downstream 
communications can have devastating consequences. If attackers can get a secret, they do not need to worry about 
impersonating an internal user. 

As organizations mature their DevSecOps practices, dedicated security engineering and security champions will 
improve overall engineering performance in terms of quality and resilience.   

As part of the process of gauging developer enablement, respondents characterized the maturity of their DevSecOps 
practices. Just more than half of all respondents reported having a formal security champions program. Successful 
security champions programs are proactive efforts at developer enablement. Providing clear, concrete, and 
repeatable security guidance for developers and operators is critical as security champions are frequently part 
of the development team, with only “dotted line” reporting to central security teams.

![Chart showing the maturity of DevSecOps organizations]

DevSecOps Organization Maturity

As organizations continue to mature, there will be greater concentrations of dedicated product security teams and 
more organizations defining their configurations, compliance and security functions as code. As application security 
continues to evolve from reactive to proactive functions and developers dedicated to security are formally allocated 
to product teams, the decentralization of security teams into the various branches of development will improve the 
organization’s defenses. This integrated approach reduces brittleness between security and development initiatives, 
and success with technology components or adopting new technologies becomes easier to achieve.

Security leaders and embedded security champions will continue to focus their efforts to support DevSecOps 
improvements. Software delivery, operational, and reliability performance should be KPIs enabled and supported by 
security champions and teams alike. Best-in-class organizations deploy more frequently and have lower lead times 
for changes. Change failure rates and failed deployment recovery times are also reduced. As DevSecOps continues 
to mature and security teams branch further among development teams, CTO and CISO goals and objectives will 
continue to overlap better. e to better overlap.

## Developer Benefits and Concerns – GenAI
Very few technologies have captured the imagination as GenAI has since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 
November 2022. Surpassing 100 million users in a matter of weeks, its uncanny ability to converse is based on the 
billions of parameters incorporated in the underlying large language model (LLM). Trained with massive datasets to 
build transformer models that are capable of interpreting intention and meaning, generative AI does not just model 
written languages such as English. The underlying transformer models and parameters are now being applied for other 
use cases such as generating software code, speech, music, video and images. The potential commercial opportunities 
for new or improved services are unlimited. 

All these innovations have spawned and accelerated other innovations. For example, LangChain, a framework to 
simplify the creation of applications with LLMs, can be used to create a series of AI agents that interface with each 
other. The extent of automation opportunities and how application interfaces will evolve are unknown. GenAI tools are 
further exposed through integration into other productivity tools. Microsoft Copilot in Office 365, Duet AI in Google 
Workspace and Firefly AI in Adobe Photoshop hint at how applications will continue to change.  

With all this high-speed innovation in AI, respondents reported that the most concerning security risks with 
AI are rapid changes that challenge existing plans (68%).

![Chart showing the security risks of greatest concern with AI]

AI Security Risks of Greatest Concern

In short order, two conversely related issues have arisen: using GenAI to improve security operations and improving 
security for GenAI. Addressing the former issue, the use of AI in security operations is not new. Machine learning 
techniques to identify outliers and better prioritize alerts have been evolving for a decade. LLM-based security 
operations that enable security operations center analysts to jointly explore security information to derive meaning 
have also emerged.

However, the latter issue of securing GenAI presents many unknowns. Within the most common chat use case, 
distinctive risk issues arise that may elude current security technologies such as data loss prevention (DLP) tools. For 
instance, chat interfaces may make no distinction between content and controls. Preventing a chatbot from generating 
or sharing personally identifiable information (PII) that was already part of its language model may be difficult to 
achieve. More education is required to understand the risks. On the one hand, adversaries employ GenAI by creating 
deepfake false identities to defraud individuals or organizations. On the other hand, depending on various factors, 
intellectual property and other sensitive data entered into a chatbot session may or may not become part of the LLM. 
Understanding where sensitive data resides and how it is accessed could prevent that data from being included in 
training data to augment an LLM.

While moving forward quickly, enterprises are still in the earlier adoption phases of AI. When respondents were 
asked where they expect their enterprises to be in the next 12 months, 50% said they would still be in the 
experimentation or exploration phases in their AI journeys. 

Historically, security and privacy maturity have lagged behind new technology adoption. Surprisingly, the risks 
created by generative AI have also opened budgets, both in existing and new spending categories. Just over half 
(52%) of respondents said they have invested in AI-specific security tools using existing budgets, reducing 
spending on other items. An additional 20% of respondents said they have invested in AI-specific security tools 
using newly allocated budget. It is refreshing to see the prioritization of this type of security spending for enterprises 
that are still in their early stages. 

With the shifting technology and ecosystem landscapes, leaders in all functional areas must continue to branch out 
to each other, anticipating and designing new use cases with potentially new business models that require a more 
inherent security design.

Characterizing the AI Journey – Next 12 Months

## The User, The Perimeter – Workforce IAM
The adage “identity is the new perimeter” has been on the minds of security leaders and practitioners alike. The 
potential impacts on and implications for workforce identities are growing, given recent initiatives related to phishing 
resistance, distributed workforces and automated access requests for governance access. Workforce IAM initiatives 
must balance new and existing challenges.

Because it serves increasingly dynamic environments, workforce IAM faces renewed challenges with authentication 
and access. For privileged users or developers leveraging secrets management, understanding which controls need to 
be applied and ensuring those controls do not affect functionality is a massive challenge. Following security principles 
of “least privilege” — limiting access to only essential purposes in dynamic environments — requires diligence to keep 
track of the combinations of users, their respective groups, and the underlying roles of those users and groups within 
applications or datasets.

No wonder that our respondents said workforce IAM was the most pressing current discipline, prioritized 
by 71% of respondents. When respondents were asked about their challenges, they most frequently cited contextual 
awareness.

On the other hand, practitioners must acknowledge that existing legacy applications are not going away. 
Only 46% of respondents said that more than 40% of employees at their organization are using multi-factor 
authentication (MFA) for cloud-based applications. MFA usage for on-premises apps is even lower. Legacy 
applications, associated datasets and their users’ burdens with passwords die hard. Legacy applications coupled 
with the growth in adoption of new apps means that the attack surface for credential stuffing is enormous. Newer 
innovations such as FIDO passkeys, which deprecate passwords and significantly reduce phishing, business email 
compromise and account takeover threats, are not universally supported by legacy apps. 

Respondents reported that workforce IAM is at somewhat of a crossroads. Spending on workforce IAM is high. 
Among the selection of categories covered in the survey, workforce IAM is number two for spending. 
It is also viewed favorably for effectiveness against attacks.

Identity infrastructure itself is increasingly under attack. Identity infrastructure, such as directories and directory 
services, has emerged as the number one cited target for attacks in the most recent survey. Cloud identities and 
privileged users are some of the more durable assets in a cloud environment.

Workforce IAM Attitudes

Temporary and dynamic roles issued by authorization systems could mitigate some risks, but the loss of an identity 
can mean an attacker has a persistent hold of the environment. The increasingly dynamic nature of authenticated 
and authorized users makes contextual awareness the number one reported challenge for workforce IAM. 

Demand for phishing-resistant MFA is gaining traction. For example, White House Executive Order 14028, the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have called 
for the use of phishing-resistant MFA such as passwordless approaches that rely on public key encryption in lieu of 
shared secrets. 

Beyond workforce IAM, new challenges to identify, authenticate and authorize processes, workloads, agents and 
devices lie ahead. The FIDO Alliance’s Device Onboarding (FDO) initiative automates the onboarding of devices with 
secrets and configuration data to connect securely with cloud and edge management platforms. 

## Ubiquitous Connections – IoT / 5G
When asked specifically about 5G technologies, only 33% said 
that the carrier’s ability to secure the network was a concern.
33%

While operational technology (OT) deployments have sometimes been criticized for having little emphasis on security, 
this year’s survey data saw IT security teams entering the OT realm as the number one way to defend against IoT 
threats (75%). OT devices such as power meters and “smart” sensors in a variety of distributed physical plants have 
been designed to be serviced with a minimum amount of oversight and a lower operational cost. 

A proactive security approach is needed. With greater connectivity options and integrations, physical or network 
isolation (“air gapping”) was the least-cited choice for securing IoT/OT environments. Perhaps reflecting the 
importance of zero-trust principles, respondents did not want to be dependent on carrier security. When asked 
specifically about 5G technologies, only 33% said that the carrier’s ability to secure the network was a 
concern. 5G amplifies IoT/OT security challenges — challenges that carrier networks cannot solely address. 

Yet these devices have been plagued by security problems. Centralized defense teams often need help understanding 
the OT estates they have, with patching being the greatest concern. OT devices have also been plagued by weak 
default passwords that are never changed by operators. Further democratizing certificate authority deployments for 
private IoT and cloud environments could pay significant dividends to authenticate or repudiate IoT and OT devices. 
Patching and authentication are the second- and third-ranked answers, respectively, among this means to address 
IoT risks. 

These proactive security approaches in security operations, patching, authentication and zero-trust principles will be 
essential as 5G and IoT initiatives converge. Enterprises continue to look to 5G as a primary IoT connectivity 
option: 69% of enterprises aim to use 5G-IoT (public or private) to support their IoT deployments, according 
to 451 Research’s Voice of the Enterprise: Internet of Things, Connectivity and Security 2023 study.

IoT, OT and 5G environments are increasingly used for critical infrastructure, including smart city initiatives. New 
frameworks, such as the NIST Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security Special Publication (SP) 800-82 
and the ISA/IEC 62443 standards, should further encourage and guide device makers to tighten their security. 
Forty-four (44%) percent of public sector respondents already cite security concerns as the number one inhibitor of IoT 
initiatives, according to 451 Research’s Voice of the Enterprise: Internet of Things, the OT Perspective, Use Cases and 
Outcomes 2023 survey. While IoT can deliver enhancements across various city outcomes, without security at its core, 
IoT deployments could present more risk than reward.

Since NIST approved four cipher suites in July 2022, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) addresses a future threat that 
moves closer to the present. While there has still been no confirmed or repeated quantum computing attack on any 
classically encrypted data, there is still cause for concern and action. 

Crypto agility — the ability to readily switch cryptographic tools and ciphers — remains a challenge for enterprises 
when underlying infrastructure or other technology may not facilitate change. Certain OT and IoT technologies have 
a 5- to 15-year life span; maintenance patching for IoT/OT remains the greatest security challenge. Similarly, on-
premises or legacy networks may also be unfeasible for currently approved PQC ciphers, or they may be difficult 
for operators to easily enable changes. Public key infrastructure (PKI), networks and long-life data all present broad 
challenges. 

Respondents expressed less interest in retiring classically encrypted data that would be susceptible to quantum 
cryptographic attacks. When asked to consider an 18- to 24-month time frame, only 23% of respondents said 
that retiring data would satisfy quantum security requirements. There is a dual reality check for security teams 
regarding PQC, the first element being that classically encrypted data today may already be harvested for future 
decryption. “Harvest now, decrypt later” attacks are unsurprisingly the top concern for our respondents.

The second reality check is that retiring information may not be permissible for technological or regulatory reasons. 
HIPAA (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) has records-retention provisions for up to six years.
