The Horizons of
Identity Security

Harnessing the power of
identity security to bend the
cybersecurity value curve

2024-2025

## Executive summary

Organizations across sectors around the world face a dual challenge: they must
counter increasingly sophisticated and pervasive cyber threats while grappling
with constrained budgets and relentless cost-cutting.

The pressures are especially intense in identity security where attack surfaces
grow and IT budgets tighten as organizations scale, yet internal and external
stakeholders increasingly demand better security and digital experiences.
Employees need quick and easy access to business applications, for example,
and customers demand seamless omnichannel interactions; both are less
tolerant of usernames and passwords.

Getting identity right is difficult, but it is critical in reducing risk and improving
customer experience. The addition of every new customer, employee,
contractor, and machine identity presents risks - along with opportunities to
create business value. Unlike other cyber capabilities, identity security has
the power to secure an organization while transforming the way customers
interact with the business. This can lead to real revenue impact, build the trust
of customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and yield lasting competitive
advantages.

To lobby their organizations for the necessary financial and human resources,
IT leaders need to understand and explain what will drive the most value—and
use those resources wisely. When it comes to identity security, the case for
investment is strong.

Our research and experience suggest that every dollar invested in identity
security delivers disproportionately higher returns, “bending” the identity
security-to-value curve. These disproportionately higher returns are observed
through higher risk reduction, business value, and productivity. Strategic
investment in IAM delivers outsized returns by unlocking new value pools such
as enhanced capability coverage and data analytics, automation, lower cyber
insurance premiums, and improved compliance.

A leading tech retailer, for example, reduced cyber risk by more than two-thirds
by setting appropriate privileges for about 6,000 accounts and automating
identity security and governance. A major financial institution reduced costs
and improved outcomes by implementing an AI-based risk management tool,
saving $300 per identity onboarded. A prominent bank improved productivity by
automating manual IAM tasks, including 90% of all access requests.

Report
## Over the last three years, SailPoint has surveyed identity and access management
(IAM) decision-makers across the globe to assess their capabilities across identity
security horizons and define the future of identity. The 350 decision-makers
we surveyed in July 2024 included senior leaders in information technology,
cybersecurity, and risk; more than half work for organizations with more than 10,000
employees, and more than half work in the finance or technology sectors. (For
details on survey demographics, please see the Appendix.)

Using their responses, we grouped their organizations into five horizons based on
strategy, talent, operating model, and technology capabilities:

*   At Horizon 1, the lowest maturity, organizations lack the strategy and technology
    to enable digital identities
*   At Horizon 2, they have adopted some identity technology but still rely heavily on
    manual processes
*   At Horizon 3, they have adopted identity capabilities at scale
*   At Horizon 4, they have automated capabilities at scale and use AI to enhance
    digital identities
*   At Horizon 5, the closest to the future of identity, boundaries are blurred between
    enterprise identity controls and the external identity ecosystem, and identity
    supports the business in next-gen technology innovations

What we found
Based on our survey of identity security decision-makers and interviews, the
following insights and themes emerged:

*   Most organizations have significant opportunities to realize the full potential
    of identity security. Of the organizations we surveyed, 41% remain in Horizon
    1. 23% are in Horizon 2, 26% in Horizon 3, and ~10% in Horizons 4 and 5. From
    2023 to 2024, only 3% moved beyond Horizon 1, and only 1% from Horizon 3 to
    4, suggesting that the full value of identity security remains untapped for the
    majority of organizations.
*   Identity security is core to overall enterprise security. Horizon 3 and 4+
    organizations have better overall security posture. For example, they have
    50% higher NIST CMMI scores, as compared to Horizon 1 and 2 organizations,
    suggesting investment in identity is an essential step toward securing
    organizations at large.
*   Organizations that advance to higher identity security horizons can “bend
    the curve”—delivering disproportionate economic impact. More mature
    organizations gain disproportionate reductions in risk, higher topline business
    value, and increased workforce productivity.
*   Organizations at Horizon 3 and beyond reduce risk through higher identity
    coverage. The gap in coverage is especially wide for third-party and
    machine identities, where the survey showed Horizons 3 and 4 organizations
    have 20-50% higher coverage of third-party and machine identities.
*   Machine identities are growing faster than all other identity types, making
    coverage of these identities increasingly important for organizations of all
    maturity levels. Growth is fueled by the increasing use of cloud workloads
    and AI applications such as copilots, prompts, ML models, and bots that tend
    to be highly fragmented within organizations and necessitate non-human
    account access. Organizations at or beyond Horizon 3 are better equipped
    to secure them, given their higher coverage.
*   Mature identity security organizations are twice as likely to use identity
    data to create actionable security or business intelligence. They use data
    to enable new use cases, for example, such as intelligent guidance for user
    access, context-aware security policies, and intelligent access reviews.
*   AI-powered use case adoption is relatively low across organizations,
    though Horizons 1-2 still trail Horizons 3 and 4. About half of those at
    Horizon 4 have adopted top AI-powered use cases, including role-access
    reconciliation, adaptive authentication, and privileged access.
*   Organizations with mature identity security have the foundations to invest
    in scalable GenAI-powered use cases. Many Horizon 4 organizations are
    now developing GenAI capabilities to enhance engineering and expand
    identity security, whereas Horizon 1-2 organizations tend to prioritize
    automation of repetitive helpdesk tasks through more mainstream solutions,
    such as AI chat bots.
*   Horizon 3 and 4 organizations scale identity coverage and capabilities
    without growing their IAM workforces by improving efficiency with
    advanced IAM solutions and shifting from helpdesk to engineering-led
    support models.
*   Horizon 3 and 4 organizations have 15-50% higher adoption of privileged
    access governance capabilities. By investing in solutions beyond credential
    vaulting and session management, they simplify access approval and
    requests while enhancing threat analytics for privileged accounts.
*   Identity security is a key to mitigating increases in insurance premiums.
    Insurers have improved their risk assessment strategies, while raising
    premiums to more accurately reflect higher risk profiles. They now assess
    the security capabilities of nearly every organization before setting
    premiums. Demonstrating advanced identity security maturity helps reduce
    cyber insurance premiums.
*   Identity-related regulations have grown sevenfold since 2010 globally
    across regions and industries. As a result, organizations must invest in
    maturing identity security capabilities to navigate complex regulatory
    landscapes and ensure compliance.

The value of identity security will continue to rise as cyber threats multiply;
legislators, regulators, investors, and insurers raise their security expectations;
and customers, employees, and business partners increasingly seek trusted and
seamless digital experiences.

Advancing identity security requires focused
resources - time, money, talent, and the
attention of senior leaders - and the costs of
inaction can be far higher. Gaps in identity
security can slow digital transformations and
cloud migrations, complicate mergers and
divestitures, stifle innovation, and attract bad
actors. One negative identity experience can
mean losing a customer forever; a major
breach can have catastrophic financial and
reputational consequences.

Advancing identity security
requires focused resources -
time, money, talent, and the
attention of senior leaders -
the costs of inaction can be
far higher.

The good news is that organizations that harness the power of identity can
overcome these challenges and deliver disproportionately higher returns. A
unified approach to identity - encompassing data, operations, and users - can
reduce risk, enhance business value, and drive substantial improvements in
business productivity.

Identity drives disproportionately higher returns and enables organizations to
build trust with customers, employees, and partners, expanding total economic
benefits and competitive advantages.

## Chapter 1:
Advances in technology
will shape the future of
identity security

Report
In the last few years, our experience and research have confirmed that the future of identity security will
be shaped by integrated identity programs. The pillars of next-generation identity security include:

*   Integration across diverse technology environments: Unified access controls provide visibility
    across all identity types, integrate with security operations, and support machine identity
    management and actionable intelligence.
*   Dynamic trust models: Zero-trust architecture and AI-driven access models enable dynamic
    authorization, adjusting permissions based on behavior and context-aware policies.
*   Federated identities: Federated access allows organizations to manage diverse identities across
    digital environments, enhancing security and user experience, with early adoption of decentralized
    protocols and digital wallets.
*   Frictionless access: Automated privileged access and password-less authentication using passkeys,
    biometrics, and certificates ensure seamless and secure user authentication.

Over the past year, three trends have emerged that complement these pillars of the future of identity:

*   Machine identity management: With the rise of AI and automated bots, organizations need to
    manage more non-human accounts, such as those used by copilots and machine learning models.
*   Integrated identity data layer: An integrated data layer is key to generating actionable intelligence
    and insights, exemplified by the development of context-rich identity graphs to create unified
    employee and customer profiles.
*   Context-aware policy enforcement: Access decisions are increasingly driven by AI-powered
    analytics, which use context-aware policies to enhance security through anomaly detection, identity
    pattern recognition, and behavior analysis.

Organizations can use these forward-thinking capabilities to set the north star vision for their identity
security strategy, which can guide innovative initiatives and capabilities that improve identity security
outcomes and create value for customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders.
