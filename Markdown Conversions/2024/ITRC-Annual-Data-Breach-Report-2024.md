I N T R O D U C T I O N
from the President

Twenty years ago next month, I was sitting at my
desk in suburban Atlanta when my phone rang. On
the other end of the line was a reporter for NBC
News – Bob Sullivan – who had some questions
about letters the company where I worked had sent
to around 20,000 residents of California about a
data breach.

That phone call started a media and public policy
avalanche that, in some ways, continues to this day.
After two decades, we still have not sufficiently
addressed the root causes of most data breaches.
Nor have the technical and policy cures adopted in
the intervening years been particularly effective in
slowing, let alone stopping, the steady increase in
events that compromise information.

In the pages that follow, you’ll find the data that
shows we are not making much progress in data
protection. In fact, stolen and compromised data
is so ubiquitous that the number of people and
businesses who have not been impacted by a data
breach is now dwarfed by the number of victims
who have been – by a factor of five1.

In 2024, we did not exceed the record number of
data breaches set in 2023, but we did come “this”
close to doing so. Within that near-record number
of compromise notices, there are a number of trends
that require discussion:

 + A significant number of data compromises

could have been avoided with basic
cybersecurity.

 + Federal and State disclosure regulations are
not having the intended prevention effects,
but state privacy laws may be.

 + The actual impact of data breaches on
people is often masked by the scale of
mega-breaches.

 + It’s difficult to quantify the impact of Artificial
Intelligence on data compromises, but there
are red flags.

In 2024, the ITRC tracked 3,158 data compromises
that resulted in more than 1.3 billion notices going
to individuals. The number of compromises is
essentially flat with the previous record-breaking
year, but the number of victim notices is up 211
percent (211%) – also known as “off the chart.”

It’s impossible to know how many individuals are
actually represented in that billion-plus notice
count – but back-of-the-envelop-math tells us that’s
an average of six (6) alerts for every adult2 in the
country. If mandatory data breach notices are
supposed to reduce the number of breaches, they
are not having the intended effect.

Despite the disconcerting overall trend lines, there
is some good news. Forty percent (40%) of states
have adopted comprehensive privacy laws, all but
one of which includes mandatory cybersecurity
standards. As we head into the 2025 state
legislative season, expect to see more state privacy
laws introduced and passed3 in the absence of a
uniform federal privacy law.

There is also an advancement in technology that is
rapidly being deployed by companies and adopted
by consumers that has the potential to all but
eliminate an entire class of cyberattacks. The
technology involves the use of “passkeys” that make
stealing or using stolen passwords obsolete.

©  IDENT ITY T HE FT  RESOURCE CENTER 2025  |   IDTHEFTCENTER.ORG

2

Today’s password practices require users to
remember a credential and organizations to store
them in databases that can be compromised.
Passkeys, though, can’t be stolen, and users
cannot self-compromise because they never know
the access key. Read more about how to set up and
use passkeys.

Best of all, if passkeys had been deployed at the
time of most, if not all, of the organizations
reporting breaches related to stolen credentials in
2024, there would not have been a breach. A
whopping 94 percent (94%) of all devices are now
ready to use passkeys, with major providers like
Amazon and Microsoft offering access to passkeys
to 100 percent (100%) of users, according to the
FIDO Alliance4.

Consumer support for passkeys is rapidly growing,
too. ITRC research shows that 30 percent (30%)
of U.S. consumers already use passkeys on at least
one account after one year of availability. Here’s to
a near future where breaches linked to credential
attacks are a thing of the past.

James E. Lee
President, Identity Theft Resource Center

1The ITRC’s 2024 Consumer & Business Impact Report (CIBIR) includes research findings that indicate that approximately eight in ten consumers and a similar number of businesses were directly impacted by at least one data
breach, cyberattack or both in the previous 12 months.

2The U.S. adult population in 2022 was 260M, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

3Unfortunately, none of the new state privacy laws address the deficiencies in state data breach notification laws.

G L O S S A R Y

Since 2020, the ITRC has published the definitions
we use in compiling and publishing this report. We
have updated our terms for the 2024 report to
include a new definition of Victim Notices to reflect
the complex dynamics of reporting the number of
individuals impacted by a compromise.

Attack Vector – The category of method used by a
threat actor to compromise an organization’s data.

Cyberattacks involve compromising an electronic
information system using software or computer
technology. Physical attacks involve
compromising data through a physical act.
System or Human Errors are failures of a
system or human being to perform as expected
or required without malicious intent that results
in a data compromise.

Data Compromise/Event – The overall term used to
refer to events where personal information is
accessible by unauthorized individuals and/or for
unintended purposes. This includes data breaches,
data exposures and data leaks.

Data Breach – When unauthorized individuals
access and/or remove personal information from the
place where is it stored.

Data Exposure – When personal information is
available for access and/or removal from the place
where it is stored, but there is no evidence the
information has been accessed by unauthorized
individuals. This typically involves cloud-based data
storage where cybersecurity protections are
incorrectly configured or have not been applied.

Data Leak – When personal information that is
publicly available or willingly shared on social media
and represents no or low risk when viewed as
individual records; however, when aggregated, the
sheer volume of personal information available in a
single database creates risk to the data subjects and
value for identity criminals who specialize in social
engineering and phishing. When these databases are
left unprotected or otherwise made publicly
available, the ITRC classifies these events as Data
Leaks.

Identity Crimes – The overall term for a wide variety
of state and federal criminal acts that are related to
the theft and/or misuse of personal information.

Identity Theft – Taking personally identifiable
information (PII) as protected by state or federal
laws.

Identity Fraud – Using stolen personally identifiable
information (PII).

Industry – Standard categories used to filter data
compromises by organization type/sector and
industry (based on SIC code).

Sensitive Records – Sensitive personal identifiable
information (SPII) as defined by statute, such as
passport numbers, SSN, driver’s license, health
information, etc.

Non-Sensitive Records – Non-sensitive personal
information (PII) as defined by statute, such as
telephone numbers, email addresses, login and
passwords, etc.

Unknown Records – Type of records compromised
are is unknown.

Threat Actor – A threat actor is the person or group
whose malicious actions results in a data
compromise. Internal actors are employees of a
compromised organization. An external actor may
be an independent person or group. A Nation/State
actor is acting on behalf of a government.

Victim Notices – The ITRC reports the number of
Victim Notices for both individual events and as
a total for all reported compromises as a measure
of the scale of events and impacts on individuals.
However, Victim Notices should not be considered a
1-to-1 count of actual victims since not all
notices include a victim count, and those that do
may not reflect the number of individuals impacted,
but rather the number of accounts compromised
including instances where a person has multiple
accounts. Aggregated totals also inflate the number
of individuals affected because of single individuals
receiving breach notices from multiple events.

 + Compromises linked to System and Human Errors
dropped by 58 percent (58%) year-over-year;
Physical Attack-related compromises such as
skimmers and stolen devices dropped to a
six-year low – 33 events out of a total of 3,158
compromises reported in 2024.

 + Publicly traded companies represented only seven
percent (7%) of all compromised organizations
(221 companies) but issued 72 percent (72%) of
victim notices (939M) in 2024.

 + Of the 133 cyberattacks against publicly traded
companies resulting in a data breach notice, a
stolen credential(s) was the leading attack vector.
However, 99 of the 133 breached organizations
(74 percent) did not list an attack vector in a
breach notice.

 + The number of data compromises reported in
2024 totaled 3,158, essentially flat with the
previous year.

 + The number of victim notices increased 211

percent (211%) year-over-year, primarily due to
five (5) “mega-breaches” that resulted in at least
100M breach notices being issued in each event.
Mega-breach victim notices totaled more than
1B of the more than 1.3B victim notices issued
in 2024.

 + Excluding the five (5) mega-breaches, the ~224M
other victim notices issued in 2024 represent a
47 percent (47%) decrease in victim notices
compared to the previous year.

 + Financial Services, led by Commercial Banks and
Insurance, was the most breached industry,
followed by Healthcare (the most attacked
industry each year since 2018 until this year),
Professional Services, Manufacturing and
Technology.

 + Cyberattacks remained the primary root cause
that resulted in data breaches in 2024. Yet, the
number of notices that did not list a specific
attack vector increased significantly for the fifth
consecutive year.
 + Approximately 70 percent (70%) of

cyberattack-related breach notices did not
include attack information compared to 58
percent (58%) in 2023. In 2019 and previous
years, ~100 percent (~100%) of breach
notices included attack vector information.

The number of data compromises reported in the
United States in 2024 reached the second-highest
level since the ITRC began tracking data events in
2005. Compromises totaled 3,158, 44 events short
of 2023’s record high of 3,202 or an approximately
one percent (1%) reduction from the previous
12 months.

However, the number of data breach notices issued
by organizations in the past year (1.3B) far
exceeded the previous number, largely due to five
(5) mega-breaches. Each of those events resulted in
victim notices ranging from 100M to 560M,
representing 83 percent (83%) of the total number
of victim notices issued for all events in 2024.

Adjusting for the small number of mega-breaches,
the number of regular victim notices issued in the
year – 224M victim notices related to 3,153
compromises – would have been a significant drop
from previous years.

Year-Over-Year

The types of information exposed in data
compromises, including data breaches, skewed
toward sensitive information with a renewed focus
on financial information along with a continued
increase in driver’s license and health information.

The lack of specific information was especially acute
when the general attack vector was a cyberattack.
Cyberattacks continued to be the primary root
cause of most data breaches, but only 30 percent
(30%) of notices included any information about the
attack vector in 2024. That was a 29 percent (29%)
increase over 2023 in a year when the overall
number of compromises dropped one percent (1%).

Year-Over-Year

The Financial Services industry knocked Healthcare
companies out of the top slot as the most
compromised industry for the first time since 2018,
despite a slight drop in the number of reported
compromises among financial institutions compared
to 2023. However, nine (9) other industries
exceeded the number of victim notices associated
with financial institutions and healthcare
organizations.

The growth in compromises in the Financial Services
category was primarily attributable to a significant
rise in attacks against Commercial Banking and
Insurance entities during the past two years.
A smaller number of increased attacks in other
industry segments also contributed to the overall
rise in ranking.

At least 1965 of the compromises reported in 2024
could have been prevented, including three (3) of
the five (5) mega-breaches that resulted in 860M
victim notices being issued. Attacks using stolen
credentials against Ticketmaster, AT&T and Change
Healthcare could have been blocked with the
addition of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA). In
testimony before Congress, Change executives
admitted that attackers broke into Change
Healthcare’s systems using a single password on a
user account not protected with MFA.

At least 21 compromises were linked to
misconfigured or non-secured cloud environments,
and at least 114 compromises were linked to files
being attached to emails or in physical
correspondence – events that could have been
avoided with improved employee training and
process monitoring tools.

Attacks against known and unknown software flaws
resulted in at least 83 attacks that could have been
blocked with the adoption of cybersecurity best
practices, including Zero Trust cybersecurity
practices, improved software development
processes like those recommended by the U.S.
Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), practices recommended by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and
improved testing, monitoring and patching.

At least 29 cyberattacks reported last year involved
“credential stuffing” attacks using compromised
logins and passwords that could have been
prevented with MFA or passkeys. As mentioned in
the introduction to this report, passkeys, when fully
implemented for internal and external use, offer the
opportunity to all but eliminate6 credential stuffing
and other credential-related attacks.

While it’s too early to tell the degree to which state
privacy laws will help prevent future data
compromises7, states continue to step into the data
protection void created by Congress’s failure to
adopt a national privacy law in 2024. Twenty (20)
states have passed comprehensive privacy laws8,
eight (8) of which go into effect in 2025:

 + Iowa – Data Privacy Law
Effective January 1, 2025

 + Delaware – Personal Data Privacy Act

Effective January 1, 2025

 + Nebraska – Data Privacy Act

Effective January 1, 2025

 + New Hampshire – Privacy Act

Effective January 1, 2025

 + New Jersey – Data Privacy Law

Effective January 15, 2025

 + Tennessee – Information Protection Act

Effective July 1, 2025

 + Minnesota – Consumer Data Privacy Act

Effective July 15, 2025

 + Maryland – Online Data Privacy Act

Effective October 1, 2025

Four states – Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania
and Ohio – have had privacy legislation carried over
from 2024 or have already been introduced for the
2025 legislative session.

Small business leaders who responded to the ITRC’s
annual Small Business Cyber questionnaire were
very aware of their state’s new cybersecurity
requirements (77 percent). However, an almost
equal number were concerned about how they
would comply (76 percent).

The number of data breach notices that did not
include actionable information, such as the root
cause of the compromise, increased in the past year.
In 2024, 70 percent (70%) of data breach notices
associated with cyberattacks did not contain
information about the root cause of the attack, an
increase of 20 percentage points in one year.
The overall number of compromises with no root
cause information grew 21 percentage points
year-over-year. Before 2020, the number of
deficient breach notices was at or near zero.

Each state and some federal agencies define a
breach differently, as well as what information must
be disclosed and when. Importantly, each state
allows the organization that has been compromised
to determine if disclosure is required. If the
organization believes there is no risk to a person
from the information being exposed or stolen, then
no notice is required.

This patchwork quilt of state laws and federal
regulations with wildly varying disclosure
requirements leads to a significant amount of
underreporting. How significant is akin to proving a
negative, but there is plenty of anecdotal evidence9
to support the conclusion. In the U.S., there are
an average of nine (9) data compromises reported
each day compared to 335 per day in the European
Union, which also requires data breach
notifications10.

The ITRC is not the only organization that has
concluded that data breach notices suffer from a
lack of helpful information. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission breach disclosure rules
adopted in 2023 required publicly traded companies
to disclose cyber incidents within four business days
after determining an incident is material. That
resulted in a 60 percent (60%) increase in
disclosures in 2024, but less than ten percent (10%)
of the notices included details of the cyber event’s
impact, including breaches, according to an analysis
by the global law firm Paul Hastings11.

States occasionally update their state data breach
notice laws in reaction to trends. Most recently,
New York added health and health insurance
information12 to the list of items that can trigger
a data breach, effective January 2025. Empire
State lawmakers also updated the amount of time
breached organizations have to inform victims from
the previous “most expedient time possible and
without reasonable delay” to 30 days from
discovering a breach. The latest change in the New
York breach law also requires the state Department
of Financial Services to be notified of all
breaches – not just by organizations regulated by
the agency – along with the Attorney General and
two other state agencies.

Headline-grabbing mega-breaches forced the
distribution of more than 1B victim notices in 2024.
Additionally, initial reports related to a breach at
data broker National Public Data claimed that 2.9B
people were impacted by the compromise. That was
later revealed to be 2.9B records, which impacted an
estimated 1.3M people.

Five (5) mega-breaches13 account for only .001
percent (.001%) of compromises in the past year but
~83 percent (~83%) of data breach notices.
Adjusting for the mega-breaches, data breach
notices in 2024 were the lowest number of alerts
issued since the final set of states adopted data
breach laws in 2018.

There are risks that come with overly focusing on
mega-breaches. They give consumers a skewed
sense of risks and contribute to a sense of “breach
fatigue” and despair. Focusing on mega-breaches
may also result in businesses – especially small
businesses – mis-allocating limited cybersecurity
and data protection resources.

While consumers can have little impact on
preventing data compromises, they can take actions
to make their personal information less useful to bad
actors. Adopting and updating basic cyber hygiene
practices involve simple and easy-to-take steps.
However, they can seem overwhelming in the face
of compromises linked to numbers that can exceed
the total population of the U.S.

The ITRC offers free information for people who
want to learn about protecting their personal
information and support for people who have
questions about what steps to take after they
receive a data breach notice.

If you receive a data breach notice, take the
following immediate actions:

 + Freeze your credit. Find out how at
FrozenPII.com powered by the ITRC.
 + Change the password of any impacted

account and any account where you use the
same password.

 + If you use the same password on more than
one account, set up unique passwords on
each account you own to prevent all of your
accounts from being compromised.

 + Set up passkeys where available.

 + Set up Multi-factor Authentication if you can’t

create a passkey.

 + Sign up for any credit monitoring or identity

restoration services offered in a breach notice
letter.

 + Contact the ITRC for additional help free of

charge.

No data breach notice directly linked the use of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to a compromise in 2024.
However, it’s clear that AI is enabling
identity-related phishing attacks and identity scams
that do lead to data compromises. The quality of
phishing lures – emails, spoofed websites, texts,
pitch scripts, etc. – has dramatically improved since
the introduction of generative AI into the
mainstream in 2022. At least 455 cyberattacks in
2024 were linked to some form of phishing14.

Threat actors are gearing up to launch a new wave
of attacks fueled by AI to find known and unknown
software flaws in enterprise applications as well as
bypass system protections15.  These kinds of
technical innovations have typically been the
precursor to exponential increases in data breaches,
most recently seen in 2023 after low-cost data
breach toolkits flooded identity crime marketplaces.

However, AI also offers defenders the same
opportunities to improve detection, defenses and
remediation. AI can improve the monitoring of
systems and inbound traffic to look for indications
of attacks. AI-driven tools in the hands of software
developers can help find and fix flaws before an
application is put into production. In other words,
the defenders can use AI for the same purposes as
attackers to prevent the mistakes that threat actors
want (and need) to exploit.

There were fewer data breaches directly linked to
Zero Day and Supply Chain16 attacks in 2024
compared to the previous year.

However, since more data breach notices linked to
cyberattacks did not include the attack vector that
led to the breach, it is not possible to know the
actual number of Zero Day and Supply Chain-based
breaches.

Zero Day attacks (exploits against previously
unknown software vulnerabilities) continued to be a
significant focus of attackers, with at least 17 attacks
resulting in 1,857,149 victim notices.

Supply Chain attacks (attacks against third-party
vendors who hold the information of multiple larger
organizations) directly impacted 134 organizations
and indirectly impacted an additional 657
entities, resulting in 203,144,092 victim notices,
190M of which were related to the Change
Healthcare breach.

Change Healthcare is a major part of the healthcare
supply chain that processes approximately one-third
of all medical claims in the U.S., according to
company executives. On January 24, 2025 after
the end of the trading day on the NYSE, Change
Healthcare’s parent company, United Healthcare
(NYSE:UNH) updated the number of victim notices
issued related to a February 2024 cyberattack. UNH
reported 190M victims impacted, but has yet to
disclose how many companies in their supply chain
have been impacted by the ransomware attack.
UNH has indicated it will file additional updates in
the future with the U.S. Department of Health &
Human Services.

5Because 2,065 of the 3,158 public data compromise reports did not include information in 2024 about the root cause of the data compromise, it is not possible to determine precisely how many events could have been blocked or
prevented.

6Identity Access Management (IAM) and security experts agree that password use is unlikely to be completely eliminated, but the risk of credential attacks will be dramatically reduced, especially when combined with app-based MFA.

7Small business leaders who responded to the ITRC’s annual Small Business Cyber questionnaire were very aware of their state’s new cybersecurity requirements (77 percent). However, an almost equal number were concerned about
how they would comply (76 percent).

8Nineteen (19) of the 20 states that have passed comprehensive privacy laws include cybersecurity provisions to varying degrees. Learn more about current and proposed state privacy laws here.

9“As a result, notification to the consumers whose personal information was exposed was significantly delayed or never occurred at all, as Blackbaud downplayed the incident and led its customers to believe that no notification was
required.” (Emphasis added) Attorney General James and Multistate Coalition Secure $49.5 Million from Cloud Company for Data Breach

10“Continuing the trend of the last couple of years, on average, there were 335 breach notifications per day from 28 January 2023 to 27 January 2024 compared to 328 during the same period last year.” - DLA Piper GDPR Fines

13Advanced Auto Parts was among customers of a popular cloud data storage platform where more than 100 companies were breached that did not require multi-factor authentication for account access, a basic cybersecurity
tool that could have prevented the attack from succeeding. Initial reports from security researchers and claims from the threat actors who attacked Advanced Auto Parts indicated ~380M customer and company accounts were
compromised that included personal information. While security researchers claim customer information was included in the stolen information, Advanced Auto Parts filed a breach notice with the State of Maine stating the personal
information of only ~2.3M current and former employees as well as job applicants was compromised. The ITRC initially reported the higher number of victims, but has updated the information regarding the Advanced Auto Parts
breach to reflect the lower number of victim notices in keeping with our revised victim count methodology.

14Because 2,065 of the 3,158 public data compromise reports in 2024 did not include information about the root cause of the data compromise, it is not possible to determine precisely how many events were linked to phishing
attacks.

16Supply Chain attacks are classified within cyberattacks since they are not classified by the ITRC as attack vectors. Only the organization breached, not the number of organizations whose data was compromised, are included in the
event count.

Designed as either a first-stop or an escalation
service, organizations can provide direct access to
trained ITRC expert advisors where victims will
receive personalized, concierge-level support based
on their unique needs.

The ITRC offers businesses a variety of
trauma-informed and culturally aware support
services to help organizations address the wide
range of unique issues experienced by their
customers who are identity crime victims.

The ITRC offers a certificate training program for
customer support center representatives. The
ITRC’s new Certified Identity Recovery Specialist
training program provides front-line staff with the
tools and skills needed to effectively partner with
customers or prospects who are identity crime
victims in a supportive and effective way.

The ITRC is a 501(c)3 nonprofit that provides
identity remediation, free of charge, to victims of
identity crime and education assistance to people
seeking to protect their identity. The Center also
provides, for a fee, data services as well as contact
center support and training services for businesses,
government agencies and academic institutions.

The ITRC does not engage in lobbying but does
provide objective research and victim-based
information to policymakers and business leaders on
topics related to identity verification, identity crimes,
data protection and privacy.

We gather information from online surveys,
anonymized victim case notes and input from
subject matter experts to identify possible solutions.
The ITRC is currently focusing on the use of
biometrics to improve identity verification and
reduce identity crimes. The ITRC will expand to
focus on data protection and privacy solutions in
2025.

The ITRC offers a range of subject matter activities
and services.

board on comprehensive data protection (privacy
and cybersecurity) will convene in 2025.

For purposes of reporting, the ITRC aggregates data
events based on the date the breach, exposure, or
leak was entered into the database rather than the
date the event occurred. This avoids the confusion
and data conflicts associated with the need to
routinely update previous reports and compromise
totals. The date of the original compromise, if
known, and the date of the event report are noted in
the ITRC’s comprehensive data breach database.

The number of victims linked to individual
compromises are updated as needed and can be
accessed in the ITRC’s breach tracking solution.

The ITRC reports Third-Party/Supply Chain Attacks
as a single attack against the company that lost
control of the information. The total number of
individuals impacted by third-party incidents is
based on notices sent by the multiple organizations
impacted by the single data compromise.

D I S C L A I M E R S

2021 Victim Notices Count (Full Year), Chart Note:
The AT&T victim count has been added to the 2021
victim count as the compromise initially occurred
and was entered in 2021. The 51M is not reflected
in the Q1 2024 victim count.

2021 Victim Notices Count, Q1 DBA Note: A Special
Comment Regarding AT&T; In August 2021,
cybercriminals offered to sell a file of information
from more than 70 million wireless AT&T accounts.

AT&T denied the company was the source of the
data and instead claimed the information appeared
to be related to a data breach from a reseller in
2019. In mid-March 2024, cybercriminals again
posted a file purported to be AT&T customer data
similar in size and content to the previous data file.
AT&T again denied it was the source of the
compromised information that included sensitive
personal information like Social Security numbers
and AT&T-specific data such as PINs. On Saturday,
March 30, AT&T reversed its previous position
and notified 7.6M current customers of the data
breach but noted the company did not know if the
AT&T-specific information originated from their
systems or from a vendor. AT&T promised to
investigate. The information of an additional 65M
former customers was also included in the breached
file. Pending the outcome of AT&T’s investigation,
the ITRC does not classify this event as a new
breach or compromise but has updated the original
2021 breach entry to reflect the number of victims
(~73M) impacted by the original event. In the event
AT&T’s investigation results in new findings as to the
source, cause, and impact of the data compromise,
we will update the data breach database accordingly.

Ticketmaster Victim Notices Count: The Ticketmaster
breach victim count is based on unverified
information provided by the threat actor claiming
responsibility for the attack. Ticketmaster has filed
a mandatory breach notice that states more than
1,000 individuals have been impacted, but has not
provided information on the number of victims by
country. The entry will be updated if, and when, an
updated victim count is reported.

Change Healthcare: On January 24, 2025 after the
end of the trading day on the NYSE, Change
Healthcare’s parent company, United Healthcare
(NYSE:UNH) updated the number of victim notices
issued related to the February 2024 cyberattack.
UNH reported 190M victims impacted, but has yet
to disclose how many companies in their supply
chain have been impacted by the ransomware
attack. Due to the classification code used by UNH,
victim notices are accounted for under the
SIC/NAICS code for computer processing, not
healthcare.

Further, according to HIPAA Journal, the
ransomware attack on Change Healthcare was
detected on February 21, 2024, and it was later
confirmed that the BlackCat ransomware group was
behind the attack. A $22 million ransom was paid
to prevent the release of the stolen data; however,
the BlackCat ransomware group performed an exit
scam, pocketed the ransom payment, and didn’t pay
the affiliate who conducted the attack. The affiliate
then worked with another ransomware group,
RansomHub, which attempted to extort Change
Healthcare further, although no additional ransom
payments were made and the stolen data remains in
the hands of cybercriminals.
