## Tackling Multi-Cloud Hurdles
©2024 Cybersecurity Insiders All Rights Reserved.

As companies increasingly leverage multiple cloud services, the challenge of maintaining security across diverse platforms becomes more acute. In 2024, securing multi-cloud environments remains a complex task, with data protection and privacy leading as the primary concern, highlighted by 55% of survey participants. This represents a slight increase from 52% observed in 2023, signaling a growing awareness and concern for safeguarding information across disparate cloud platforms. The challenge of possessing the right skills for deploying and managing solutions across all cloud environments follows closely, although it has seen a decrease from 58% in 2023 to 51% in 2024. This drop could indicate an improvement in training or a shift in focus towards other emerging issues.

Understanding how different solutions integrate (47%) remains at the number three spot, suggesting a continued emphasis on the cohesion of cloud services. Similarly, the challenge of understanding service integration options (44%) reflects the complexities of ensuring seamless operation across cloud environments. The management of costs associated with different cloud security solutions has seen a significant rise in concern, from 37% in 2023 to 42% in 2024, likely reflecting both budget constraints and the increasing financial implications of multi-cloud strategies.

What are your biggest challenges securing multi-cloud environments?
![Chart showing multi-cloud security challenges]

- Ensuring data protection and privacy for each environment 55%
- Having the right skills to deploy and manage a complete solution across all cloud environments 51%
- Understanding how different solutions fit together 47%
- Understanding service integration options 44%
- Managing the costs of different solutions 42%

Addressing these challenges starts with enhancing professional skills through targeted education and certifications.

## Simplifying Cloud Security Solutions
©2024 Cybersecurity Insiders All Rights Reserved.

The integration and management of security solutions within cloud infrastructures are pivotal for maintaining organizational agility and safeguarding assets. This survey question sheds light on the operational complexity of handling multiple security solutions, which is a key concern for IT and cybersecurity professionals navigating the multi-cloud environments discussed previously.

About two thirds of users (69%) must access three or more separate security solutions to configure their enterprise’s cloud policies. More than a third of respondents (36%), report utilizing 3-4 separate security solutions in their operations.

The data also shows a significant portion (31%) using only 1-2 solutions, up from 28% in 2023, confirming the consolidation trend. This is down from 41% in 2023, suggesting a trend towards simplification and integration of security functionalities to reduce the complexity and potential for inefficiency in managing a diverse set of tools. However, a notable 21% are managing 5-6 solutions (up from 20% in 2023), indicating a high complexity and potential challenges in ensuring seamless security operations.

How many separate security solutions do your users have to access to configure the policies that secure your enterprise's entire cloud footprint?
![Chart showing the number of security solutions used]

69% of organizations depend on at least 3 separate security solutions to manage cloud security across their enterprise
- 1-2 Security solutions 31%
- 3-4 Security solutions 36%
- 5-6 Security solutions 21%
- 7-10 Security solutions 7%
- 11+ Security solutions 5%

Fragmentation in security tools can lead to increased complexity and potential gaps in cloud protection. Security professionals also struggle to keep up with requirements and alerts, making it harder for security to be more proactive. This challenge underscores the importance of strategic consolidation and optimization of security tools to enhance efficiency and efficacy. For organizations, this means prioritizing the adoption of integrated security platforms that can provide comprehensive protection without the overhead of managing numerous disparate solutions. Such a shift can not only streamline security operations but also improve response times and reduce potential gaps in defense strategies, aligning with the need for robust data protection and skilled management in multi-cloud environments.

## Transitioning to Cloud-Based Security Solutions
