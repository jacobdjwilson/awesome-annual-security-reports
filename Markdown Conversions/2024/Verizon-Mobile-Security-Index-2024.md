2024 Mobile
Security Index

Report

Who should read this report? 

We produced the Verizon Mobile Security Index (MSI) to help security 
professionals, such as chief information security officers (CISOs), assess their 
organization’s mobile security environment and calibrate their defenses. This 
report is also relevant to anybody involved in the specification, procurement or 
management of IT devices and services.

About this report

In April 2024, we commissioned an independent market research company to 
survey 600 people responsible for security strategy, policy and management. 
We also worked with several leaders in mobile device security: Akamai, Allot, 
CISCO, Fortinet, Ivanti, Jamf and Lookout. These contributors provided 
additional information, including incident and usage data. 

We’d like to thank all our contributors for helping us to present a more complete 
picture of the threats that affect mobile devices and the work that is being done 
to mitigate these threats. This report wouldn’t be possible without them.

For more information on our methodology, see page 45\. 

About the cover

The depiction of a cell tower on the cover reflects mobile device security 
issues in critical infrastructure sectors that were seen in this year’s MSI survey 
responses. Critical infrastructure industries supply the essentials of daily life to 
millions, including power, water, communications and transportation. In parallel, 
there are heightened risks from threat actors targeting organizations in these 
industries, along with an expanding attack surface from increasing Internet of 
Things (IoT) and mobile device use. Enhancing mobile device security serves 
to reduce financial and operational risks for organizations in all industries. 
In critical infrastructure, it has even more profound implications.

Critical infrastructure 
on the radar 

The first iPhone was released in 2007\. Mobile devices 
have evolved dramatically and are now embedded 
into the daily lives of billions of people around the 
globe. What’s more, the already healthy use of mobile 
devices by organizations and their employees shot 
into the stratosphere during the COVID\-19 pandemic, 
when remote work suddenly became the new 
normal and kitchens and living rooms were instantly 
transformed into remote offices.

This 2024 Verizon Mobile Security Index report has some familiar themes—such as 
the persistence of remote and hybrid work—while also revealing emerging mobile 
security considerations relating to critical infrastructure sectors, rising Internet 
of Things (IoT) deployments and artificial intelligence (AI) advances (from both 
attack and defense perspectives). We also found interesting differences between 
respondents’ perceptions and reality. Many assume that they had solid mobile 
security in place and that incident remediation would be quick and easy. But what 
those respondents actually report about attacks and breach frequency, along with 
negative breach impacts and worries, told a different story.

In our deeper dive into the critical infrastructure sector, we found that inadequate 
mobile security in any of the 16 defined critical infrastructure industries could have 
significant impacts on organizations in these industries and could have downstream 
impacts on the communities and individuals served.

From the survey data, one primary conclusion can be drawn: The growth of mobile 
computing and IoT is exponentially expanding the attack surface that needs 
protection, which in turn will require a matching focus on ensuring sufficient mobile 
security processes, policies and investments.

MSI 2024 Introduction

Modern work, 
enabled by mobile 

Even as some organizations pull workers back to the office, the remote or hybrid 
work paradigm is not likely to shift back to its prior state anytime soon. One reason 
is employees still strongly prefer the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the 
time, to work non\-traditional hours, or to spend part of each workday in the office 
and part at home. 

92%

of office\-based employees 
value being able to work 
flexible hours.1 

92%

of organizations have 
employees who work 
from home at least some 
of the time.

89%

83%

value working remotely at 
least part time.2 

have employees who follow 
a hybrid work model. 

90%

value being able to leave 
work during the day for 
personal reasons.3

80%

have employees who 
travel for work.

Employers on the whole still 
favor allowing employees to work 
remotely. Whether it’s working 
from home, the airport, a hotel 
or the local coffee shop, 92% 
of survey respondents say their 
organizations support some 
form of remote connectivity. 
This means that mobile devices 
are more deeply embedded into 
business\-critical workflows than 
they were in the past.

80%

of respondents agree 
mobile devices are critical 
to the smooth running of 
their organizations.

55%

of organizations have more 
users with more mobile 
devices than they did 12 
months ago.

46%

of respondents agree that 
mobile devices have gone 
from a nice to have to a 
critical business tool.

Employer support for flexible and remote work means an expanding array of mobile 
devices of various types are connecting to enterprise networks on a regular basis. 

Increasingly, these devices are also being used to access sensitive information. 

50%

say mobile devices have 
greater access to sensitive 
information than a year ago. 

86%

agree that flexibility in 
where people work and 
what devices they use is key 
for attracting top talent.

86%

agree that increased 
remote working has moved 
mobile security up their 
agenda.

Because mobile devices 
now play an ever\-expanding 
role in enterprise computing 
environments, these 
ecosystems are more complex, 
more diverse and more 
dynamic than ever before.

62%

of authentications to 
corporate networks 
come from mobile and 
non\-traditional operating 
systems—a new high.4

With hybrid and remote work 
becoming an established 
cornerstone of workplace policy 
and organizations depending more 
heavily on more different types 
of devices—in more locations—
strategic investments in mobile 
security are no longer optional.

IoT—everything, 
everywhere, 
all at once 

Mobile devices have been keeping businesses up and running for years. What’s 
changed recently is rapid growth in IoT deployments. These “things” give real\-
time visibility into the status of thousands of processes, from how machines are 
performing in factories to where vehicle fleets are traveling each day—even whether 
office buildings are set to the right temperature. 

IoT adoption supports digital transformation across nearly every industry, making 
it possible to keep a watchful eye on the performance of key assets and enabling 
smarter, data\-driven decisions. 

More IoT devices than ever

While reliance on mobile devices across all types of organizations has remained 
high, increasing only slightly over the last few years, IoT use has become nearly 
as ubiquitous. Nearly all organizations are using at least some IoT devices. What’s 
more, the majority of deployments are mature, full\-scale implementations, not partial 
deployments or proofs\-of\-concept. 

95%

of survey respondents 
work for organizations 
that are using at least 
some IoT devices.

62%

said they have mature, 
full\-scale IoT deployments.

Nearly infinite applications 
and use cases

IoT sensors and devices are being applied in an enormous and expanding array of 
use cases. They’re helping keep facilities secure and comfortable, hospital patients 
properly monitored and cared for, and supply chains flowing. Retailers use them to 
track store inventories, while others use IoT to monitor energy consumption. Another 
popular use case is predictive maintenance, which supports more reliable uptime in 
production operations, such as those in the manufacturing or energy sectors.

Organizations that use IoT devices are using them in more than three ways, on average.

IoT use is especially 
high in critical 
infrastructure sectors.

IoT devices are also used to transform 
power supply networks into smart grids, 
turning metropolitan areas into smart 
cities, and making many types of public 
facilities safer and more comfortable. 
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg of 
IoT uses across critical infrastructure 
operations.

As a result, IoT adoption is expanding 
rapidly across nearly all critical 
infrastructure sectors.

96%

of critical infrastructure 
organizations report some 
degree of IoT adoption.

The National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) describes critical 
infrastructure industries as providing 
a “backbone for society’s economy, 
security and health.”5

As such, these sectors are often a prime 
target of nation\-state threat actors 
according to NIST, especially those 
focused on disrupting national security 
and public safety—because critical 
infrastructure operations are considered 
essential to national security. 

Today, the widespread and growing use 
of IoT sensors and internet\-connected 
devices can also expand cyber risks. 

The many uses 
of IoT in critical 
infrastructure 

IoT devices and sensors today are 
used to monitor and control all types 
of assets, facilities and systems across 
a wide range of critical processes, 
increasing efficiency, security and 
resilience. IoT devices enable predictive 
maintenance across industrial 
environments and can detect an early\-
stage equipment failure before it results 
in downtime. They are also used to 
improve worker safety while decreasing 
the need for manual interventions.

MSI 2024 IoT use is especially high in critical infrastructure sectors

What is critical 
infrastructure?
The U.S. Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security 
Agency (CISA) has designated 
16 industries as critical 
infrastructure sectors, 
as follows:6

• Chemical—enterprises that 
manufacture, store, use and 
transport chemicals, including 
potentially dangerous 
chemicals on which other 
sectors rely

• Commercial facilities—sites 
where large crowds of people 
gather for shopping, business, 
entertainment or other 
activities

• Communications—an 

interoperable network of 
satellites, wireless and 
wireline communications 
that provides an enabling 
function across all critical 
infrastructure sectors

• Critical manufacturing—a 

subset of manufacturing with 
national significance, for 
which a successful attack 
could disrupt essential 
functions at a national level

IoT security risks: 
Amplified in critical 
infrastructure sectors 

IoT devices often have weak security 
and network connectivity. This makes 
their existence an expansion of the 
attack surface. This exposure is 
particularly concerning for critical 
infrastructure organizations, which 
are already attractive targets for some 
of the most sophisticated and best\-
resourced threat actors in 
the world. 

IoT devices are still not subject to asset 
management or security monitoring 
in all organizations. And IoT devices 
tend to monitor legacy equipment 
in operational technology (OT) 
environments that may lack modern 
security features—a common reality in 
critical infrastructure industries.

IoT 
vulnerabilities

Many IoT security vulnerabilities 
exist from the time of the device’s 
manufacture. Many come with weak 
default passwords, and changing them 
often isn’t intuitive. Some devices have 
credentials embedded in firmware, 
making them impossible to change. 
Others may not use authentication at all. 
And because IoT devices are designed 
to use little power to reduce costs and 
extend battery life, their processing 
capabilities are extremely limited. This 
limitation means they can’t run anti\-
malware programs or encrypt data 
shared across enterprise networks.

Network connectivity dominates IoT 
security challenges. Many devices are 
designed to connect automatically to 
the nearest Wi\-Fi or local area network 
(LAN), potentially turning each device 
into an easy and attractive entry point 
for attackers looking for a stepping 
stone to wider networks. 

At the same time, it can be difficult to 
secure communications between IoT 
devices and cloud apps. And it’s also 
often hard to deliver and install security 
updates to devices in the field.

A lack of industrywide security 
standards for IoT devices and their 
communication protocols increases 
security risks, as does having many 
devices installed in remote locations 
where they may be vulnerable to 
physical tampering.

Critical 
infrastructure 
on the radar

IoT adoption is widespread in critical 
infrastructure sectors, where nearly all 
respondents report that they have at 
least some IoT devices in use. 

More than half of respondents in critical 
infrastructure sectors report that they 
had experienced significant security 
incidents involving mobile or IoT 
devices. By “significant security 
incidents,” we mean incidents resulting 
in data loss or system downtime. 

96%

of critical infrastructure 
organizations use IoT 
devices.

53%

of critical infrastructure 
respondents have 
experienced significant 
mobile or IoT device\-related 
security incidents leading 
to data loss or system 
downtime.

48%

of critical infrastructure 
respondents have 
experienced a major 
impact due to a security 
compromise of an IoT 
device.

MSI 2024 IoT security risks: Amplified in critical infrastructure sectors

12

Another prime 
target: Public 
Sector

The Public Sector also faces significant 
mobile and IoT\-related security 
risks. According to the 2024 Data 
Breach Investigations Report, Public 
Administration is a top target for 
organized crime, along with state\-
affiliated threat actors (together 
responsible for 96% of breaches 
caused by external actors in which the 
actor type was known, n\=305\).7 Thirty 
percent of breaches in this sector (when 
known) were espionage motivated.8

70%

of Public Sector 
respondents report 
that their organizations 
experienced a security 
incident involving a mobile 
or IoT device.

Respondents in critical infrastructure 
organizations are aware of the severity 
of the risks they face. Most understand 
the consequences of a security breach, 
and they see the proliferation of mobile 
and IoT devices as a formidable security 
challenge. Nonetheless, rapid adoption 
continues.

87%

of critical infrastructure 
respondents believe a 
security breach involving 
mobile and IoT devices 
would have a substantial 
impact on their business.

86%

of critical infrastructure 
respondents agree that 
security risks associated 
with mobile and IoT devices 
have escalated over the 
past year.

44%

of critical infrastructure 
respondents identify 
“integration of mobile and 
IoT services” as a daunting 
security challenge.

Top target: 
Energy 
and utilities

Critical infrastructure organizations see 
great benefit from the efficiencies and 
visibility that IoT brings. In the energy 
sector, sensors help workers detect 
transmission line and power station 
outages. Using data analytics, energy 
providers can better direct power 
across the grid to balance supply and 
demand, while helping to maximize 
the integration of renewable energy 
sources. Smart meters and thermostats 
are increasingly coming online in homes 
and businesses, providing data that 
utility companies now use to improve 
services.

It’s no surprise IoT adoption is close 
to universal in the energy and utility 
sectors. But it’s critical for these 
organizations to develop smart risk 
management strategies, since threat 
actors have increasingly demonstrated 
eagerness to target them. Look no 
further than the Colonial Pipeline 
ransomware attack, the Saudi Aramco 
drone strike, or the sabotage of the 
Nord Stream pipelines to appreciate 
the vast geopolitical consequences of 
such activities.

90%

of energy and utilities 
respondents agree that 
managing the nation’s 
critical infrastructure 
makes them a prime target 
for cybercriminals.

All sectors perceive 
increased mobile 
and IoT risk.

Since we launched this report seven years ago, we’ve seen the percentage of 
companies that suffered a mobile compromise trend steadily upward, from less than 
30% in 2018 to more than half (53%) today. Some of this increase is related to the 
expanding attack surface. As mobile and IoT devices are embedded into all types of 
workflows, the sheer number of devices and apps that businesses rely on snowballs 
(as do the risks).

Awareness vs. 
real\-world risks

For business users and consumers, 
2023 was a record\-breaking year 
for mobile threats. More zero\-day 
vulnerabilities were discovered in 
iOS than ever before. The risky data 
collection policies used by popular 
apps such as TikTok and PinDuoDuo 
were on public display, while 75% of 
organizations experienced mobile 
phishing attempts targeting their 
employees.9

In 2023, almost every iOS update that users were 
asked to install on their smartphones involved a 
security vulnerability.13

More than 260 iOS Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were published 
in 2023\. Because so many mobile device operating systems aren’t updated as often 
as they should be, the data and personal information stored on or accessible through 
them remain susceptible to exploits for extended periods of time. And the number 
of attacks that exploited vulnerabilities as the critical path to initiate a breach nearly 
tripled (a 180% increase) in 2023 compared to the prior year.14 Some of this growth is 
due to enormously successful widespread campaigns, such as the Cl0p ransomware 
gang’s exploitation of the MOVEit file transfer tool, which ultimately impacted millions 
of victims.15

33%

Mobile and IoT security lags

Our ongoing reliance on mobile devices and rapid increase in IoT use generates

The vast majority of respondents (93%) express concern about mobile cybersecurity 
risks. Nonetheless, a minority (39%) have defined organizationwide IoT standards, and 
even fewer (37%) say their organizations centrally coordinate IoT projects.

Defining and adhering to cross\-organizational standards is crucial to helping 
ensure IoT devices and sensors can keep up with evolving security and regulatory 
requirements. With enormous variability in device capabilities, use cases and risks, it’s 
important to set technical and non\-technical standards for each IoT project across 
every business unit.

(NIST) recommends baselining 
the following core technical 
capabilities:17

Mobile phishing

Data is the currency of modern enterprises. Establishing a strong data 
security strategy is not only a critical defense measure, but also a strategic 
business enabler. 

In years past, organizations had dedicated private data centers, housing 
multiple servers, network equipment and storage devices. These setups 
not only presented scalability issues, but required continuous hardware 
and software upgrades to accommodate rising data needs. If not well 
maintained, this infrastructure is also highly susceptible to malware and 
vulnerability\-based attacks.

Today, a majority of corporate data resides in the cloud across an increasing 
number of software\-as\-a\-service (SaaS) and private apps. While this 
infrastructure is better maintained, making network bugs less of a concern, 
critical corporate data is also more widely distributed. This distribution 
presents other challenges, such as the risk of system misconfigurations, as 
sensitive data flows across an expanding set of apps.

With more corporate data residing in the cloud, we’re seeing a shift 
away from traditional malware and vulnerability attacks. Because cloud 
infrastructure is better maintained, the return on investment for traditional 
exploits has diminished. In response, threat actors have changed their 
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), to focus on leveraging social 
engineering, targeting a user’s mobile phone to steal credentials and 
impersonate users. With credentials in hand, they have immediate access to 
critical corporate infrastructure and sensitive data. We refer to this change 
in TTP strategy as the modern kill chain. 

To illustrate, consider recent high\-profile attacks: MGM Resorts, Caesars 
Entertainment and Twilio. In each instance, the threat actor group known as 
Scattered Spider used the phishing kit Oktapus to social engineer via mobile 
devices. In another example, the Lookout Threat Intel team discovered a 
similar phishing kit, CryptoChameleon that has been used by what was 
likely a different group of threat actors to target the FCC, Coinbase, Google, 
Microsoft and other organizations.

If a phishing attack is successful and a threat actor is able to get login 
credentials, the subsequent steps in the modern kill chain move rapidly. With 
direct access to an organization’s cloud infrastructure, the attack dwell time 
has gone from months to minutes. This also brings severe repercussions 
for individuals, who are at risk of identity theft, along with the organizations 
that are required to safeguard sensitive data. Defending against rapid 
modern attacks requires organizations to have clear visibility and automated 
response capabilities, both at the mobile endpoint and across their software 
as a service (SaaS) and private applications.

Breach risks and impacts 
are high, especially in 
critical infrastructure.

Mobile security risks are 
real—and expanding. All 
types of organizations 
are adding mobile 
and IoT devices into 
their daily operational 
processes, without 
extending robust 
protections across all 
endpoints. As a result, 
the attack surface is 
expanding. Again, 
critical infrastructure 
is at heightened risk 
overall, from increased 
IoT use to legacy 
systems and equipment 
to nation\-state targeting.

Mobile 
incidents and 
consequences

Not only are mobile compromises 
trending up, but the consequences 
of breach incidents can be profound. 
Widespread bring\-your\-own\-device 
(BYOD) policies have led to corporate, 
sensitive or regulated data being stored 
on or passing through mobile devices. 
And because mobile devices are so 
easy to carry, they’re also easy to steal. 
If a mobile device has high\-value data 
stored on it, a breach can result in the 
immediate loss or theft of that data, 
especially if the device’s lock screen 
is disabled or it doesn’t have remote\-
deletion capabilities.

It’s especially worrisome that 
attackers who compromise a mobile 
device frequently use the infected 
device to gain access to company 
networks. This can result in large\-
scale data exfiltration, the spread 
of ransomware, customer and 
employee privacy violations and 
costly operational downtime.

53%

of respondents 
experienced an 
organizational security 
incident involving a mobile 
or IoT device that resulted in 
data loss or downtime. 

25%

of organizations have at 
least one mobile device 
user on staff who has 
disabled their lock screen 
feature, even though only 
3% of all devices have the 
lock screen disabled.20

47%

report that such 
compromises had 
major impacts on their 
organizations.

The potentially high cost of breaches 
to critical infrastructure 

Consequences of a mobile\-related breach can be especially devastating for 
organizations in critical infrastructure sectors. Mobile—and especially IoT—devices 
are embedded in mission\-critical processes and workflows. A breach or failure can 
disrupt operations and has the potential to impact human health and safety. 

92%

of healthcare respondents 
agree that the highly 
confidential nature of 
patient data makes their 
organization a prime target 
for cybercriminals. 

85%

of Public Sector 
respondents agree that 
a security breach of 
their organization could 
endanger lives, especially 
if critical or emergency 
services go down.

82%

of manufacturing 
respondents agree that 
a security compromise 
could disrupt their 
company’s supply chain, 
bringing serious financial 
implications. 

Critical infrastructure 
organizations tend 
to face higher 
remediation costs and 
downstream losses 
when a breach occurs. 
Among respondents in 
critical infrastructure 
organizations that had 
suffered a compromise:

Nearly half (40%) admit 
they experienced damage 
to their reputations and 
loss of business.

More than a quarter (28%) 
report that addressing 
the incident required 
expensive remediation.

Mobile attack objectives 
and how to address them

According to research from Jamf, the majority of malicious actors 
targeting mobile devices are trying to achieve one of the six goals 
outlined below.21 That’s why it’s a good idea to follow best practices 
adapted for mobile from standards such as the NIST Cybersecurity 
Framework and Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks to help 
protect your organization. 

Michael Covington 

Vice President, 
Portfolio Strategy 

Jamf

Gain access to confidential business 
data. Attackers are frequently motivated 
by financial gains or competitive 
advantages; theft of intellectual 
property is frequently cited as a top 
motivator for developing malware.

Spy on users without their knowledge 
or consent. Threat actors have been 
observed taking advantage of the 
always\-on, always\-with\-us nature of 
mobile devices to listen to conversations, 
intercept SMS messages and track 
physical movements through GPS.

Bypass internal security 
protections. Modern operating 
systems like iOS have built\-in 
protections to restrict what can run on 
mobile devices. Changes to Apple’s 
controlled distribution model via 
regulation like the EU’s Digital Markets 
Act is reducing the efficacy of those 
once controlled walls built to protect 
the mobile device.

Obtain private data without 
authorization. Researchers at Jamf 
have seen malicious apps circumventing 
Apple’s Transparency, Consent and 
Controls (TCC) as part of the attack 
chain targeting Apple users, ultimately 
weakening built\-in protections and 
making device compromise easier. 
Apple’s mobile devices have similar 
features in place to protect end user 
privacy that can also be tampered with 
as the attacker looks for the weak links 
in the chain.

Run malicious code on devices. Zero\-
click exploits are well\-documented, but 
vendors are quick to patch vulnerabilities 
that are exposed to the remote attacker. 
The ultimate goal is usually for the 
attacker to gain a foothold on the device 
from which they can surveil, exfiltrate 
data or pivot to another asset.

Pivot from an infected device to 
compromise networks. Beyond 
data theft, privacy compromises 
and persistence objectives, it’s not 
uncommon for attackers to simply use 
a compromised (and trusted) mobile 
endpoint to move closer to the more 
valuable target within the organization.

Shadow IT: A looming 
security challenge

Whose mobile device is 
that? Where did it come 
from? How did it get 
connected to our network? 
Is its operating system 
up to date? Does it meet 
compliance requirements? 
These questions are 
being asked by security 
professionals inside many 
organizations today. And 
as mobile and IoT devices 
continually connect to 
enterprise networks, 
many organizations face 
challenges in keeping 
track of them all. 

Out of the 
shadows

We define shadow IT as the use of 
hardware or software by a department 
or individual without the knowledge 
or oversight of the organization’s IT 
or security team. Shadow IT adoption 
takes place across all sectors. With 
so many organizations prioritizing 
agility and end\-user experiences and 
too few building universal security 
policies across locations and device 
types, there’s fertile ground in many 
enterprises for shadow IT to grow, 
creating additional security risks.

Without oversight, shadow IT devices 
are at high risk of misconfiguration, 
having out\-of\-date or unpatched 
software such as apps and operating 
systems, or having insecure apps 
downloaded from an untrustworthy 
source. As a result, end\-users are 
vulnerable to phishing, malware and 
other attacks.

Survey respondents indicate growing 
concerns about the risks unmanaged 
devices pose.

54%

are very or quite worried 
about shadow IT.

87%

of respondents are at least 
somewhat worried about 
shadow IT.

BYOD risks

Companies that allowed employees 
to use their own devices at work 
peaked in 2021, in the aftermath of 
the COVID\-19 pandemic.22 Since then, 
BYOD adoption has stabilized, with a 
majority of companies either allowing 
or considering allowing personal device 
use for work\-related tasks.

Securing employee\-owned devices 
is often considerably more difficult 
than securing corporate devices, 
especially without a mobile device 
management (MDM) solution in place. In 
reality, adopting a BYOD policy means 
making a concession: It’s the same as 
saying that some shadow IT is okay. 
If employees are allowed to use their 
personal devices at work, everyone 
in the organization is entrusted with 
responsibilities that once belonged 
only to the IT department. Still, many 
organizations offer BYOD policies. 

59%

of respondents allow 
employees to access work 
email from their personal 
phones/devices.

An additional 

34%

are considering doing so.

Security tools 
and policy 
advantages

Research from Ivanti shows that today’s 
top employees prefer workplace 
policies that include flexible scheduling 
and hybrid work that allow them to 
work where and when they’re most 
productive.23

80%

of office\-based workers 
highly value workplace 
flexibility, or find it 
something they can’t do 
without.24

41%

would consider changing 
jobs to gain more flexibility 
at work.25 

79%

agree letting people work 
anywhere is the future of 
professional employment.26

Secure 
connectivity

It’s not just mobile device vulnerabilities 
that generate risks. Insecure 
connectivity makes it easier to steal 
data or compromise the confidentiality 
of sensitive information. For many 
organizations, the pressure’s on to allow 
remote workers to use public Wi\-Fi, 
home Wi\-Fi and cellular networks. Even 
those that don’t explicitly allow these 
types of connectivity often struggle to 
prevent it in real\-world scenarios.

37%

of employees in 
organizations that ban 
(or don’t have a policy on) 
the use of public Wi\-Fi use 
it anyway. 

45%

of employees in 
organizations that ban 
(or don’t have a policy on) 
the use of home Wi\-Fi use 
it anyway. 

26%

of employees in

To meet their employees’ rising expectations, companies provide support and 
solutions to enable them to work securely, regardless of their location. Organizations 
that have defined policies for allowing public or home Wi\-Fi use or the use of cellular 
networks for work purposes have an edge here. 

Nearly all respondents (99\+%) indicate their 
organizations have implemented remote access 
security technologies. The most commonly used 
solutions in this category include:

Emerging AI 
cyberthreats meet 
new AI defenses.

If there’s one constant that’s held steady 
throughout decades of cybercriminal 
activity, it’s that threats are always 
evolving. Threat actors are the ultimate 
shape\-shifters, forever changing their 
tactics as defenders adopt measures to 
counter them. What’s different today is 
the accelerated pace of the evolution. 
The latest advances will allow attackers 
to launch more attacks faster than 
ever before.

The generative 
AI revolution

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and 
Google Gemini have been making 
headlines and dominating conversations 
for the last year. At the moment, we 
may be in a grace period when it comes 
to mobile security and AI\-enabled 
cyberattacks. According to the 2024 
Verizon Data Breach Investigations 
Report, there’s not much evidence 
cybercriminals are yet harnessing these 
tools to carry out attacks at scale.27

However, it’s likely that threat actors are 
experimenting with generative AI now, 
building their skills and bots that will 
eventually let them use Gen AI to code 
malware more quickly, or scale up the 
volume of highly effective and targeted 
phishing attacks.

AI threats yet 
to come

Expanding AI use will likely lead to 
an increase in the volume of attacks 
criminals launch within the next year. 
It’s also possible that more frequent 
attacks will have a greater impact. Initial 
changes to the threat landscape are 
likely to be subtle—until they’re not. 
As is typical in the dynamic world of 
cybersecurity, a widespread new exploit 
can change the picture overnight.

Threat actors of all types, from the 
most sophisticated nation\-states and 
highly resourced criminal syndicates 
to solo cybercriminals, will eventually 
adopt AI. They’ll go for the least 
sophisticated, lowest\-effort applications 
first. Generating more phishing 
messages? Pretty simple. Translating 
social engineering attempts into multiple 
languages? Done. 

With AI threats on the horizon, 
defenders should prepare now for the 
next generation of attacks. And they 
should be on the lookout for AI\-assisted 
attacks involving deepfakes and SMS 
phishing, which will likely form the first 
wave of AI\-powered threats.28

As AI\-driven cyberthreats 
loom, defenders, including 
cybersecurity vendors such 
as Verizon, are working quickly 
to incorporate AI technology 
into mobile security tools and 
services. These solutions 
can help and are already 
helping organizations gain 
faster, better, more in\-depth 
threat monitoring, access 
verification, and real\-time 
phishing detection.

77%

of respondents believe 
AI\-assisted attacks like 
deepfakes and SMS 
phishing are likely to 
succeed.

88%

believe that AI\-assisted 
cybersecurity solutions 
will become increasingly 
important in the future.

The disconnect between 
perceived and actual 
mobile security 

Despite rising concerns about everything from breach risks to mobile\-driven attacks 
and potential AI threats, survey data leads us to believe that the extent of concern 
shown by respondents often doesn’t seem to match the risks. 

A false sense of security

Respondents report high levels of confidence in their mobile defenses across a 
number of areas. For instance, they express a great deal of faith that current mobile 
device security measures are effective, with 96% asserting that their defenses are at 
least somewhat effective.

How would you rate the effectiveness of your 
organization's mobile device security measures?

Compromised? No problem.

Another area where respondents express high levels of confidence was in their 
ability to recover quickly from a breach incident.

This, too, is at odds 
with what respondents

Underlying 
unease

Despite a professed confidence in their 
ability to protect against mobile\-based 
threats and recover from incidents, 
respondents also simultaneously cite 
persistent mobile security worries. 
Almost half believe end users are 
complacent about data privacy and 
security, oblivious to the dangers of 
credential theft, and tend to exercise 
poor security hygiene. 

Lack of visibility 
and control

Part of the problem could be that 
respondents simply don’t know what 
they don’t know. With the proliferation of 
shadow IT, little centralized IT oversight 
of IoT projects and many employees 
taking a choose\-your\-own\-adventure 
approach to home and public Wi\-Fi 
connectivity, security stakeholders 
face a daunting challenge in accurately 
assessing the risks.

87%

say they are at least 
somewhat worried about 
shadow IT.

Critical infrastructure 
sectors have specific 
considerations.

90%

of energy sector 
respondents agree that 
managing the nation’s 
infrastructure makes them 
a target for cybercriminals.

Mobile and IoT\-related risks are a reality across industries, but every vertical is 
unique. Each has its own threat profile, its own use cases for IoT deployments and its 
own regulatory requirements. 

While mobile security challenges exist across all industries, these risks were found to 
be elevated across critical infrastructure sectors. 

Energy

The energy sector has long been a top target of nation\-state attackers interested 
in disrupting operations, stealing information assets and harming the economy, 
according to the International Energy Forum. 

What’s more, energy sector companies are caught between a rock and a hard place 
when it comes to IoT implementation. These devices are viewed as essential to 
optimizing processes by most respondents (64%), but nearly as many (62%) view IoT 
as a major security challenge. 

Nearly half of respondents (49%) view greater use of IoT\-enabled services as vital 
to improving employee safety. Of course, a major breach involving cyber\-physical 
systems in this industry has the potential to threaten human health and safety, too. 
How’s that for a paradox?

Public Sector

The Public Sector’s mission—to provide the essential services necessary for public 
welfare—makes it an attractive target for malicious actors looking for ways to cause 
far\-reaching societal harm. At the same time, accelerating digital transformation 
of public services can make it faster, easier and more efficient for government 
organizations to meet the needs of their constituents. Mainly taxpayer\-funded, 
Public Sector entities must also operate within firm budgetary constraints, making 
the efficiencies delivered by IoT particularly attractive. 

The desire to digitize services for greater efficiency and cost benefit is driving 
significant IoT adoption in the Public Sector. Public Sector respondents to our 
survey agree that increased use of IoT is essential for accelerating their digital 
transformation and meeting budget pressures. However, nearly half (47%) cite IoT 
use as a daunting security and privacy challenge as well. Yet a majority prioritizes 
cost\-efficient digital service delivery over cybersecurity risk. 

Unfortunately, the risks are severe. A significant majority (85%) of Public Sector 
respondents believe that a security breach in their industry could endanger 
human lives.

Healthcare

Along with digital healthcare technology, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is 
poised to transform every aspect of patient care from appointment scheduling to 
diagnostics, all the way through to continuous glucose, temperature and cardiac 
monitoring—and beyond. 

The potential consequences of a security breach in this sector are also severe, 
especially considering what could happen if connected medical devices are targeted, 
given the role they play in critical care and life\-support systems. 

Telehealth is perceived as presenting a valuable opportunity to improve patient 
care and an opportunity for growth by more than two\-thirds of healthcare sector 
respondents (71% and 67%, respectively). Less than half (44%) understand telehealth 
adoption as a daunting security and privacy challenge. For many stakeholders in this 
sector, improving the quality of patient care is a higher priority than mitigating cyber 
risk. At the same time, more than nine in 10 respondents (92%) believe that their 
industry is a top target for cybercriminals.

Financial services

Since the start of the pandemic, mobile banking has rapidly evolved from a “nice to 
have” to a “can’t live without” for many consumers. To meet customer expectations, 
financial institutions must deliver convenient, friction\-free digital experiences to their 
customers—at any time, in any place, on any device. At the same time, criminals 
tend to go where the money is, making banks and financial services firms a high\-
value target. Balancing regulatory constraints, attractiveness to bad actors and the 
convenience needs of customers is no easy task.

Financial sector respondents believe that using mobile\-based services is essential if 
they are to stay relevant to consumers, but they also think that maintaining a strong 
cybersecurity reputation is vital for attracting and retaining their customers.

90%

of manufacturing 
respondents agree 
that growing OT and 
IT integration makes 
mobile device security 
more critical.

92%

of manufacturers are

Manufacturing

In manufacturing, efficiency and productivity are major drivers of revenue growth. 
It follows that IoT adoption by manufacturing organizations can offer enormous 
benefits. Embedding sensors into production processes can optimize throughput, 
enable predictive maintenance analytics to prevent downtime and improve quality 
control. IoT devices can also gather the data that manufacturers need to meet 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives. 

With all of these potential benefits, it’s no surprise that the use of IoT devices and 
mobile\-based services is on the rise among manufacturing sector respondents. 
What’s concerning, however, is that increasing operational technology (OT) and IT 
convergence—and with it the added connectivity between networks and physical 
production operations—both raise the possibility that a breach could jeopardize 
expensive infrastructure, as well as human health and safety. When digital devices 
control physical systems like robotic arms, cyber risks potentially become risks to 
life and limb.

awareness and solution 
investments are rising.

84%

of respondents increased 
or significantly increased 
mobile security spending 
in the past year.

86%

anticipate further 
increasing mobile security 
spending next year.

While the survey illuminates some worrisome trends, there’s also good news to share. 

As large\-scale ransomware attacks and data breaches now regularly make headlines, 
stakeholders have taken notice. Mobile security spending has been on the rise for 
years, and the pace is likely to increase as greater awareness of the risks and costs 
of breaches drives organizations to centralize controls, standardize security policies 
and deploy effective solutions. 

Security spending is up.

Investments in securing mobile and IoT devices are rising. In fact, more than four in 
five organizations (84%) increased mobile device security spending over the past 
year. The increases were driven by a rising volume and greater awareness of threats, 
along with increased remote work. And spending is likely to increase in next year’s 
budget too, which is an encouraging sign that more organizations are taking a harder 
look at mobile security.

Also good news: Critical infrastructure organizations are increasing their spending 
to match or exceed other sectors. 84% of those surveyed said mobile security 
spending has grown in the past year. And they’re even more likely to be planning 
to invest more in the year ahead. Because the growing importance of AI to cyber 
defense is widely recognized, a number of these investments will likely be in AI\-
powered solutions. 

Covering the bases

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) originally covered five key 
functions of a healthy cybersecurity program: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond 
and Recover. In February 2024, NIST added an additional function, Govern. 
Together, these categories provide recommended steps and best practices across 
the cybersecurity function. 

The Govern function covers risk management strategy, expectations and policy. 
It designates roles and responsibilities to foster stakeholder accountability. It also 
addresses cybersecurity supply chain risk management. 

Perhaps because this function was so recently introduced, it’s seeing a slightly 
lower level of investment. Otherwise, spending is expanding across all functions, 
with investments balanced across each area of protection.

The importance of an 
integrated approach to 
securing mobile networks

Only a platform\-based approach to cybersecurity can manage the technological 
and architectural complexity associated with mobile connectivity to deliver 
effective and efficient protection and support compliance. Unlike point solutions, 
a cybersecurity platform integrates vendor\-specific and third\-party capabilities, 
allowing for greater automation, visibility and collaboration across endpoints, 
networks, clouds, applications and services. A mature cybersecurity platform will 
reduce operational costs, drive operational efficiencies and optimization, improve 
the organization’s security posture overall and help maintain business continuity.

A platform approach offers several benefits, beginning with consolidated coverage 
that ensures organizations have fewer cybersecurity vendors to manage. It also 
features natively integrated capabilities that share information such as events, 
threats and telemetry from different parts of the network. This enhances visibility 
and control. By adding a high degree of automation, such a platform will be able to 
help reduce human error, accelerate threat response, improve outcomes and free 
staff to work on higher\-value tasks. 

Above all, an 
integrated 
cybersecurity 
platform should:

Enable protection, detection 
and response to threats and 
vulnerabilities

Protect network exposure 
so that the enterprise can 
reliably deliver revenue\-
generating services and 
earn customer trust

Support compliance 
requirements, including 
those of customers

Make all of the above 
possible with automation 
and security operations 
(SecOps) capabilities

MSI 2024 Mobile security awareness and solution investments are rising

IoT security is also 
making strides.

More good news: Greater 
awareness is driving 
more investment in 
IoT security. And the 
expanding use of IoT 
security best practices, 
such as deploying 
organizationwide 
standards, centralizing 
coordination of IoT 
projects and devices, and 
applying more oversight 
for IoT projects, are also 
impacting IoT security 
spending.

Keeping a close eye on “things”

Among survey respondents who have deployed IoT devices, nearly all have applied 
at least some IoT security practices, and most are monitoring the effectiveness of 
encryption measures applied within IoT frameworks. Nearly four in five (79%) use 
automated tools for this purpose, while just under one\-half (46%) are still relying on 
manual audits or third\-party assessments. 

93%

of IoT users have applied at 
least some IoT security best 
practices. 

70%

of IoT users have applied 
role\-based access control 
to provision access to 
their devices.

96%

use automated 
solutions to monitor 
the effectiveness of the 
encryption measures used 
to protect IoT device data.

The majority of respondents (69%) 
now have systems in place to track 
and automatically apply security 
patches to all of the IoT devices in their 
organizations. We can take this as a 
positive, in that modern IoT security 
practices are happening fairly widely. 
But it’s also a negative result given how 
cyberattacks work. Cyberattacks are like 
water; threat actors find “leaks,” or gaps 
in coverage, and exploit them to launch 
an attack. The 31% of respondents citing 
no systems in place to automatically 
track and patch all IoT devices are 
shouldering substantial risk. 

MSI 2024 IoT security is also making strides

37

But IoT security 
gaps remain.

Even when organizations 
have IoT protections in 
place most of the time, 
or for most IoT sensors 
or devices, leaving any 
gaps open is all it takes 
to get through. And once 
inside, threat actors can 
move laterally, especially 
if network segmentation 
is lacking. 

Organizations must 
be proactive and 
avoid complacency, 
especially in critical 
infrastructure sectors.

Mind the gaps.

In the 2022 MSI, 53% of responding organizations had defined IoT security standards 
that applied to all projects, and 48% of organizations centrally coordinated all of their 
IoT projects.29 This year, only 39% of respondents say they have defined IoT security 
standards that apply to all projects, and just 47% have centralized coordination of all 
IoT projects. 

These decreases are likely due to the extremely rapid pace of IoT adoption. When 
you’re moving fast, it can be difficult for security to keep pace. The decrease may also 
be evidence of shadow IT projects, where individual lines of business coordinate their 
own projects without full, centralized control. No matter how you slice it, significant 
security policy gaps remain that translate to a higher degree of cyber risk.

31%

of respondents do not 
have systems in place to 
track all IoT devices in their 
organizations.

46%

still rely on manual audits 
to keep track of IoT 
device encryption. 

53%

lack centralized oversight 
of all IoT projects.

Secure the edge: 
how to safeguard your 
organization now

Mike Riemer 

Field Chief Information 
Security Officer

Ivanti

Protect your edge, secure your network.
To combat the onslaught of threats, organizations must prioritize the following:

software on edge devices.

promptly when they become available.

devices, for suspicious traffic and anomalies.

1\. Timely patches: Apply security patches to edge devices 
2\. Software updates: Run the latest version of the solution’s 
3\. Continuous monitoring: Monitor networks, including edge 
4\. Zero trust: Grant access only when necessary and verified, 
5\. Least privilege: Give administrators and users only the 
6\. Layered defense: Use a multi\-layered security approach, 

including firewalls, intrusion detection and endpoint 
protection.

permissions required for their roles.

following zero trust principles.

The edge under attack
Your edge devices are showing. 
And threat actors love it. In the 
era of Everywhere Work, edge 
devices are everywhere—and have 
become an attractive target for 
sophisticated attackers. These 
devices serve as entry points to an 
organization’s network, allowing 
threat actors to move laterally and 
embed themselves. This can lead 
to significant data breaches and 
operational disruptions. 

Act now, defend 
your edge.
As the number of connected 
devices grows, securing 
edge devices becomes a 
necessity—not an option. 
Implementing proactive 
measures can significantly 
reduce an organization’s 
attack surface, mitigate 
risks and maintain a 
robust security posture 
even when (and it’s when, 
not if) threats morph, 
evolve and get smarter.

Don’t allow edge devices 
to become the weak link 
in your network security 
chain. Take action now to 
protect your organization’s 
valuable assets.

More to do. 
More that can be done.

Going forward, organizations need to 
take mobile security more seriously. 
The targeting of critical infrastructure, 
expanding use of IoT, emerging AI 
threats and other security drivers are 
relentlessly hammering organizations 
and spurring a new reckoning between 
executive leaders and security teams.

Another driver behind the need for 
improved mobile security is 5G, which 
is here and expanding rapidly. 5G 
networks are faster and more capable 
than ever before, encouraging people to 
use their mobile devices—and cellular 
data—for more tasks, more often. Within 
organizations of all types, this is likely to 
accelerate mobile and IoT deployment, 
ushering in a wide array of new uses 
and further enlarging the cybersecurity 
attack surface. 

68%

of Verizon customers have 
5G capable cell phones, up 
from 24% one year ago.30

56%

of data traffic runs over 
4G services, compared 
with 81% one year ago.31

Set security goals.

The designed\-in security capabilities of 5G services are superior to those of 2G, 3G 
and 4G networks, with advances such as mutual authentication, improved subscriber 
identity protection and an inter\-network security gateway. Still, 5G networks are open, 
and additional controls and protections must be implemented to protect mobile and 
IoT devices in enterprise environments.

Setting purposeful objectives is essential, but those goals may be even more critical 
for mobile security, where accelerated IoT growth, for example, is outpacing security 
coverage in most organizations. 

Respondents are investing in mobile security to achieve the following objectives:

59%

are increasing the security 
of end user activities. 

47%

are reducing the burden 
on IT (for instance, by 
automating tasks).

56%

are integrating security 
management of phones, 
tablets and laptops.

45%

are reducing inconvenience 
to users and increasing 
productivity.

48%

are enabling new services 
for remote workers.

Using industry standard frameworks

The vast majority of respondents (84%) have adopted or are considering adopting 
a cybersecurity framework. This move helps ensure that all departments and 
stakeholders are on the same page when it comes to adhering to industrywide best 
practices and standards. Approximately half (49%) of organizations are already 
using a secure service edge (SSE) framework, while 50% are using a secure 
access service edge (SASE) framework. More than two in five (44%) are currently 
considering SSE, with a slightly smaller percentage (42%) considering SASE. Both 
of these frameworks are converged approaches that bring cloud\-native security 
technologies together into an integrated architecture to eliminate holes in protection 
and improve any organization’s security posture. 

Zero trust and the NIST CSF 2\.0 are not yet widely adopted, but many organizations 
(45% and 48%, respectively) are considering each of them. However, a noteworthy 
minority of respondents say they’ve rejected or haven’t given thought to the 
frameworks (16% for zero trust, 14% for the NIST CSF 2\.0\), revealing a trove of best 
practices and informational support that are not being taken advantage of.

83%

of global organizations are 
planning to implement a 
converged security solution 
extending comprehensive 
security measures across 
services, networks and 
platforms.32

As companies expand 
mobile and IoT 
connectivity, they’ll 
need to embrace 
security standards that 
empower them to reap 
technological benefits 
without opening their 
organizations to security 
vulnerabilities that 
threaten operations 
and potentially even 
their livelihoods.

89%

of respondents agree 
organizations need to take 
mobile device security 
more seriously.

The impact of compliance 
requirements

Regulatory requirements are another driver of mobile security investments. The 
two regulations to which the largest number of respondents are subject are the 
Department of Defense\-aligned Cybersecurity Maturing Model Certification (CMMC) 
and Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

With CMMC 2\.0 set to become a Final Rule in early 2025, a large number of defense 
contractors and subcontractors will need to improve their processes and controls 
to become audit\-ready in the near future. At the same time, fines imposed for 
GDPR violations continue to rise, with approximately €2\.1 billion in fines imposed in 
2023 alone, which is more than all GDPR fines imposed in 2019, 2020 and 2021 
combined.33

Another European framework, NIS2, will require critical infrastructure organizations 
to demonstrate specific cybersecurity protections and capabilities in the months 
and years ahead. The growing awareness of common risks and threats to critical 
infrastructure organizations, as well as government mandates to achieve an effective 
baseline of protection, can help accelerate cybersecurity best practices worldwide 
and lead to better defenses that combat rising threats to global citizenry. 

In the not\-too\-distant future, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s material 
incident disclosure requirement will likely have a significant impact as well.34

The call to arms: 
Move faster.

In putting together this 
report, we experienced 
moments of optimism as 
well as pessimism. While 
we were relieved to see 
positive indicators, like 
rising investments and 
awareness of mobile 
security and the growing 
adoption of technologies 
such as SASE to 
improve remote access 
security, organizational 
efforts are still falling 
short of recommended 
benchmarks.

In a world where attacks can have 
devastating impacts on everything from 
production operations to revenue to 
reputation and even to people’s health 
and safety, awareness is simply not 
enough. Unknown, unmanaged and 
unmonitored mobile and IoT devices can 
pose substantial security risks.

38%

of critical infrastructure 
respondents know 
someone who has had a 
mobile device or mobile app 
hacked, compared to 36% 
of respondents in other 
industries.

73%

in critical infrastructure 
say leadership only takes 
cybersecurity seriously 
after a breach.

Critical 
infrastructure 
requires 
doubling down.

Those responsible for securing the 
critical infrastructure that delivers our 
food, water, power, transportation, 
healthcare, emergency services and 
much more simply cannot take half 
measures. The potential consequences 
of a breach at a nuclear power plant 
or a regional hospital, for example, are 
simply too grave to ignore. 

If people are to trust public services 
and consumers are to trust companies, 
organizational and security leaders 
must do more. They must strive for 
full visibility into all IoT projects across 
their organizations. They must enforce 
consistent standards for mobile security 
as well as IoT built\-in device security, 
network segmentation and data 
encryption—everywhere. 

They need to teach employees and 
end users about the dangers of 
credential theft, the importance of basic 
security hygiene, and the power of 
skepticism and situational awareness 
on an ongoing basis. And they should 
work tirelessly to build and cultivate a 
robust cybersecurity culture in their 
organizations. Anything less than 
unrelenting protection efforts is too little 
when the stakes are so high.

And it’s not just about critical 
infrastructure organizations. Across all 
industry responses to our survey, similar 
patterns of mobile and IoT security 
gaps were present. That means there’s 
work to do across the board. Public 
and private organizations must work 
together to deploy shield after shield, 
defense after defense, obstacle after 
obstacle, to foil threat actors attempting 
to interfere with the immense progress 
mobile and IoT connectivity delivers.
