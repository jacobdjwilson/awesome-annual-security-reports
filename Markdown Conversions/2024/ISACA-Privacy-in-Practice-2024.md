## Abstract

Privacy in Practice 2024 reports the results of the ISACA global State of Privacy Survey conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023. This report focuses on privacy staffing, privacy operations, compliance, awareness training, privacy by design and breaches. While some survey findings are consistent with last year’s survey results, others indicate that privacy teams may need to manage with fewer resources in the next year.

## Executive Summary

Privacy in Practice 2024 explores privacy staffing, operations, compliance efforts, awareness training, breaches and privacy by design based on the results of the fourth annual ISACA global State of Privacy Survey conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Respecting data subjects and protecting their privacy is a key component of digital trust. Additionally, failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in significant fines and reputational harm. Privacy professionals who optimize their resources and build privacy into their products and services can gain a competitive advantage and protect their consumers. This survey report examines the state of organizational privacy.

### Key Findings
This year’s survey results reveal important insights for enterprises:

- **Demand for technical privacy roles** is significantly more likely to increase in the next year than demand for legal/compliance roles.
- **Perceptions of funding and board prioritization** of privacy are comparable to those reflected in last year’s survey results.
- **This year’s respondents** were significantly more likely than last year’s to believe their privacy budget would decrease in the next 12 months.
- **Respondents identified the chief privacy officer role** as the most likely to be accountable for privacy operations.
- **Over one-third of respondents** had no plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform privacy-related tasks despite understaffing and lack of funding.
- **Expert-level privacy professionals** are the most difficult to hire, consistent with last year’s findings.
- **The most common obstacles** to creating privacy programs are a lack of competent resources; a lack of clarity on the program’s mandate, roles and responsibilities; a lack of executive or business support; and a lack of visibility and influence within the enterprise.
- **The most common privacy failure** is poor or nonexistent training.

> Privacy professionals who optimize their resources and build privacy into their products and services can gain a competitive advantage and protect their consumers.

Based on the survey responses, enterprises that practice privacy by design are more likely to:
- Have more interaction across all functional areas of the organization
- Have an organizational privacy strategy that aligns with other organizational objectives
- Be confident in their organization’s ability to ensure the privacy of its sensitive data
- Feel their privacy budget is appropriately funded
- Separate privacy training from security training

## Survey Methodology

In the fourth quarter of 2023, ISACA sent survey invitations to approximately 15,500 ISACA constituents who held the Certified Data Privacy Solutions Engineer™ (CDPSE™) designation or had “privacy” in their job title. Invitations were also sent to those who held the ISACA CSX Cybersecurity Practitioner Certification™ (CSX-P™) or Certified Information Security Manager® (CISM®) designation. More than 1,300 people completed the survey.

![Figure 1: Respondent Demographics. Top industries: Technology services/consulting (30%), Financial/banking (26%), Government/military (14%). Years of experience: 1-5 (7%), 6-10 (18%), 11-15 (19%), 16-20 (19%), 21-25 (13%), 25+ (22%). Total revenue: Less than $50M (26%), $50M-$99M (12%), $100M-$499M (18%), $500M-$999M (21%), Greater than $1B (21%). Region: North America (46%), Europe (22%), Asia (20%), Oceania (4%), Latin America (4%), Africa (4%). Number of employees: 1-249 (20%), 250-999 (18%), 1,000-4,999 (23%), 5,000-24,999 (17%), 25,000 or more (22%).]

Some respondents held multiple additional ISACA certifications. Thirty-nine percent of respondents were in management roles, 28 percent were in senior leadership roles, 20 percent were individual contributors, and the remaining 13 percent were in executive leadership positions. Figure 1 shows additional demographic information about survey respondents.

## Staffing Trends

Privacy professionals largely fall into two groups: legal/compliance professionals and technical privacy professionals. Legal/compliance professionals have expertise in the law and the ability to understand regulatory obligations. Technical privacy professionals have the skills and experience to evaluate and apply technical controls that can help achieve privacy objectives. In some enterprises, professionals in these roles work side-by-side on the same team, while in other enterprises, these roles are distinct functions that report to different executive leaders.

Technical privacy roles appear to be more understaffed than legal/compliance roles. Fifty-four percent of survey respondents said technical privacy roles were somewhat or significantly understaffed, while 44 percent of survey respondents said legal/compliance roles were somewhat or significantly understaffed. This is consistent with previous years’ findings, in which technical privacy roles were typically more understaffed than legal and compliance roles. In this year’s survey, the median privacy staff size was nine employees, compared to 10 last year, so it is not surprising that this understaffing trend is unchanged from last year’s findings.

### Open Privacy Positions
Many respondents indicated that their enterprises had open privacy roles. Twenty-five percent said their organizations had open legal/compliance privacy roles, and 31 percent reported open technical privacy positions. This is a slight decline from last year when 27 percent of respondents’ organizations had open legal/compliance positions and 34 percent had open technical privacy positions. This is consistent with anticipated budget cuts; if privacy budgets are expected to decrease, it makes sense that hiring will slow down.

![Figure 2: Time to Fill Open Legal/Compliance Privacy Positions. <2 weeks (2%), 1–3 months (23%), 3–6 months (25%), >6 months (16%), Cannot fill open positions (3%), Don’t know (11%), Not applicable (20%).]

Eighteen percent of respondents said the time required to fill legal/compliance roles had somewhat or significantly increased, which is identical to last year’s findings. Nineteen percent of respondents said the time required to fill open technical privacy positions had increased. This represents a decline from last year when 23 percent of respondents said the time to fill open technical positions had somewhat or significantly increased.

![Figure 3: Time to Fill Open Technical Privacy Positions. <2 weeks (2%), 1–3 months (20%), 3–6 months (25%), >6 months (16%), Cannot fill open positions (3%), Don’t know (11%), Not applicable (23%).]

### Qualifications
A major impediment to filling open positions is that many applicants are not considered well qualified. Only 21 percent of respondents indicated that more than half the applicants to legal/compliance roles and technical privacy roles in their enterprises were well qualified for the position for which they are applying, compared to 24 percent for legal/compliance applicants and 25 percent for technical privacy applicants last year.

![Figure 4: Identified Skill Deficiencies. Top gaps: Experience with different types of technologies/applications (63% in 2024 vs 63% in 2023), Experience with frameworks/controls (54% in 2024 vs 49% in 2023), Technical expertise (49% in 2024 vs 45% in 2023), Understanding laws/regulations (44% in 2024 vs 46% in 2023), IT operations knowledge (41% in 2024 vs 38% in 2023).]

These results may signal a shift in hiring managers’ expectations for privacy professionals. Possibly they understand that very few candidates with technical expertise will also have legal expertise, and they may no longer be striving to hire a single person who can do everything. It is also possible that the rapidly evolving technology landscape has made technical expertise a more valuable candidate trait.

![Figure 5: Importance of Factors in Determining an Applicant’s Qualifications. Very/Somewhat Important: Compliance/legal experience (95%), Prior hands-on experience (94%), Credentials held (93%), Technical experience (93%), Completion of hands-on training (82%), University degree (69%), Recommendation from previous employer (68%).]

Though survey respondents indicated that previous privacy experience was desirable in a candidate, the reality is that many practitioners pivoted to their careers in privacy. Forty-four percent of respondents said that more than half of their enterprise’s privacy staff started their careers in a completely different field and transitioned to privacy roles. In fact, only 18 percent of respondents indicated that more than half of their enterprise’s privacy staff began their careers in privacy.

![Figure 6: Actions Taken to Address Privacy Skills Gap. Training for nonprivacy staff (50%), Increased use of contract employees/consultants (39%), Performance-based training (25%), Reliance on credentials (24%), Reliance on AI/automation (18%), Apprenticeships/internships (17%), Nothing done (13%), Don't know (10%), No gap (3%).]

### Demand for Privacy Professionals
Expert privacy professionals are the most challenging category to hire as evidenced by 76 percent of respondents, followed by practitioners (48 percent) and entry level/foundational privacy professionals (14 percent).

The demand for privacy professionals across all expertise levels is expected to increase over the next year. Figures 7 and 8 show the anticipated demand for legal/compliance and technical privacy professionals over the next year, respectively. This year’s respondents did not believe the demand would increase as significantly as last year’s respondents did. Last year, 62 percent of respondents said they anticipated the demand for legal/compliance roles would increase, and 69 percent of respondents said the demand for technical privacy professionals would increase in the next year.

The increasing demand coupled with staff retention challenges could exacerbate understaffing issues in the future. Forty-one percent of respondents said they experienced difficulty in retaining qualified privacy professionals.

![Figure 7: Demand for Legal/Compliance Privacy Roles. Increasing (55%), Staying the same (30%), Decreasing (2%), Don't know (11%), Not applicable (2%).]

## Privacy Operations

To be successful, privacy programs require buy-in from the entire enterprise. Privacy professionals need to collaborate with nearly every department in their organization. The tone set at the top influences the enterprise’s attitude and culture toward privacy. Enterprises with boards of directors that do not adequately prioritize privacy and that fail to provide it with the resources and funding it needs will likely experience challenges in accomplishing privacy objectives and meeting compliance requirements.

### Collaboration
Privacy professionals must collaborate regularly with other enterprise functions. Figure 9 shows the functional areas privacy professionals must work with and the percentages of respondents who said they always or frequently collaborated with these departments.

It is concerning that only 34 percent of respondents regularly worked closely with procurement; only 34 percent worked regularly with product/business development; and a mere 23 percent worked regularly with sales, marketing and customer relations. Procuring technology that has strong privacy controls built in is crucial to protecting data subjects. The technology underlying an organization’s offerings must protect privacy, and without being involved with the procurement process, it is nearly impossible for privacy professionals to practice privacy by design.

![Figure 9: Privacy Professionals Working Across the Enterprise (Always/Frequently). InfoSec (78%), Legal/Compliance (71%), Risk Management (64%), IT Ops/Dev (62%), Internal Audit (51%), HR (36%), Procurement (34%), Product/Business Dev (34%), Sales/Marketing (23%), Finance (23%), Public/Media Relations (22%).]

### Accountability for Privacy
Depending on how an organization is structured and taking into account the competencies of the C-suite, privacy professionals may report to different leaders. Figure 10 shows who is primarily accountable for privacy.

Enterprise size may affect who is ultimately accountable for privacy. Twenty-seven percent of respondents who worked at enterprises with fewer than 250 employees said the chief executive officer (CEO) was accountable for privacy, but only 8 percent of respondents at organizations with more than 25,000 employees said the CEO was primarily responsible. Thirty-two percent of respondents at enterprises with 25,000+ employees said the chief privacy officer was primarily accountable for privacy at their organization, but only 10 percent of respondents at enterprises with fewer than 250 employees said a CPO was primarily responsible.

![Figure 10: Accountability for Privacy. Chief Privacy Officer (21%), CIO (17%), Executive-level security officer (15%), CEO (14%), General Counsel (10%), Chief Compliance Officer (9%), Other (5%), Don't know (4%), Board of Directors (4%), No person accountable (2%).]

### Boards of Directors and Privacy
The board of directors can have a significant impact on an enterprise’s privacy program. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said their boards adequately prioritized privacy. This is a slight increase compared with last year when 55 percent of respondents said their boards adequately prioritized privacy.

![Figure 11: Board Prioritization of Privacy. Yes (57%), No (23%), Don’t know (17%), Not applicable (3%).]

Boards may prioritize privacy programs in a few ways. A compliance-driven approach considers privacy a regulatory requirement. An ethical approach prioritizes privacy regardless of applicable laws and regulations. Some enterprises may view privacy protection as a competitive advantage.

![Figure 12: Board Perceptions of Privacy Programs. Compliance driven (44%), A combination (29%), Ethically driven (22%), A competitive advantage (4%).]

Last year, only 33 percent of respondents said their boards viewed privacy as being compliance-driven, while this year that number rose to 44 percent. Seventy-four percent of respondents said their organization’s privacy strategy was aligned with organizational objectives.

### Funding
Board prioritization and the organizational perception of privacy is important as it could affect staff buy-in for privacy initiatives and resources available for privacy teams.

![Figure 13: Funding for Privacy. Underfunded (43%), Appropriately funded (36%), Don't know (15%), Overfunded (6%).]

This year’s survey finding that 43 percent of respondents considered their organization’s privacy budgets underfunded is fairly consistent with last year’s. However, respondents were much less optimistic about the future of privacy budgets this year compared to last year.

![Figure 14: Privacy Budgets in the Next 12 Months (Trend 2021-2024). 2024: Increase (24%), Stay same (34%), Decrease (14%), Don't know (28%). 2023: Increase (25%), Stay same (35%), Decrease (12%), Don't know (27%). 2022: Increase (27%), Stay same (31%), Decrease (8%), Don't know (34%). 2021: Increase (29%), Stay same (29%), Decrease (16%), Don't know (26%).]

It appears that privacy budgets have been declining significantly in recent years. This is especially concerning because 63 percent of respondents who believed their privacy budgets were already underfunded anticipated that funding would decrease in the next 12 months. This aligns with global economic trends; global growth in 2024 is forecast to be lower than in 2023.[^1]

But privacy may be disproportionately affected by the economic downturn: Only 11 percent of respondents to ISACA’s State of Cybersecurity 2023 survey anticipated a decrease in their cybersecurity budget.[^2] This could be because high-profile breaches, such as the LastPass breach,[^3] have motivated enterprises to not cut cybersecurity spending.

### Artificial Intelligence
Despite challenges associated with understaffing and underfunding, most respondents were not leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for privacy work.

![Figure 15: Plans to Use AI. No plans (36%), Plan in next 12 months (28%), Don't know (28%), Currently use AI (8%).]

Only 8 percent of respondents were using AI for privacy-related tasks. This is surprising, as 41 percent of respondents to a recent ISACA survey indicated that their organizations’ employees were using generative AI.[^4] The reluctance to adopt AI might be a positive sign: Survey respondents might understand that AI is not a panacea for privacy challenges.

## Compliance

To date, more than 160 privacy laws have been enacted internationally.[^5] Because of the numerous privacy laws and regulations in effect, privacy teams are often scrambling to keep up with their compliance-related obligations. Seventy-eight percent of survey respondents said they used a framework or law/regulation to manage privacy in their organizations.

![Figure 16: Frameworks and Regulations Used to Manage Privacy. GDPR (53%), NIST Privacy Framework (44%), ISO/IEC 27002:2013 (35%), ISO/IEC 27701 (30%), COBIT (27%).]

Technical privacy professionals must work closely with legal/compliance teams to understand their regulatory obligations.

![Figure 17: Frequency of Meetings Between Technical Privacy and Legal/Compliance Professionals. As new laws go into effect (27%), Quarterly (19%), Monthly (23%), Weekly (8%), 1–2 times per year (17%), Never (6%).]

Many enterprises are putting additional privacy controls in place that go beyond what is legally required. The top five most-used additional controls reported by survey respondents are:
- Identity and access management (74 percent)
- Encryption (73 percent)
- Data security (72 percent)
- Data loss prevention (67 percent)
- Incident response plan (63 percent)

![Figure 18: Confidence in Achieving Compliance. Somewhat confident (37%), Very confident (32%), Completely confident (11%), Not so confident (10%), Not at all confident (3%), Don't know (6%), Prefer not to answer (1%).]

## Privacy by Design

Privacy by design refers to the integration of privacy into the entire engineering process. Sixty-nine percent of respondents said their enterprises practiced privacy by design when building new applications and services.

![Figure 19: Frequency of Practicing Privacy by Design. Always (23%), Frequently (29%), Sometimes (34%), Rarely (10%), Never (4%).]

Consistent with previous years’ survey results, those at enterprises that always practice privacy by design tend to have more resources. The median staff size at enterprises that always practice privacy by design was 15 compared to 9 for total respondents.

Key trends among those who always practice privacy by design:
- More likely to say their technical privacy department was appropriately staffed (42 percent vs. 34 percent total)
- More likely to feel their privacy budgets were appropriately funded (50 percent vs. 36 percent total)
- More likely to believe their board adequately prioritized privacy (77 percent vs. 57 percent total)

## Privacy Awareness Training

Almost any employee can cause a privacy breach, so it is important that all staff complete privacy awareness training. Most survey respondents said their organizations provided privacy awareness training (86 percent).

![Figure 20: Frequency of Privacy Awareness Training. Annually (66%), As part of new hire training (52%), Quarterly (18%), After significant event (17%), No training (6%), Don’t know (5%), Other (3%).]

Nearly half of respondents (49 percent) pointed to a lack of training or poor training as a common privacy failure.

![Figure 21: Reviewing and Revising Privacy Awareness Training. Annually (60%), As new laws go into effect (23%), Every 2-5 years (9%), No training conducted (5%), Do not revise (3%).]

The metrics respondents used to evaluate their privacy training programs include:
- Number of employees who completed privacy training: 65 percent
- Number of privacy incidents: 56 percent
- Number of privacy complaints received from customers: 37 percent
- Comparison of pre-and post-training assessments: 23 percent

Sixty percent of respondents separated privacy awareness training from security training.

## Privacy Breaches

Reports of privacy breaches were consistent with last year’s survey findings. Eleven percent of respondents said their organizations experienced a material privacy breach in the last 12 months. Sixty-three percent said their organizations did not, 8 percent preferred not to answer, and 18 percent did not know.

![Figure 22: Comparing Breach Trends (2024 vs 2023). More breaches (6% vs 5%), Fewer breaches (20% vs 16%), Same number (18% vs 21%), Prefer not to answer (23% vs 26%), Don't know (33% vs 33%).]

![Figure 23: Likelihood of a Privacy Breach in the Next Year. Likely (16%), Neither likely nor unlikely (33%), Unlikely (22%), Don't know (23%), Prefer not to answer (6%).]

## Conclusion

Privacy laws and regulations have required many enterprises to prioritize privacy and expand their privacy-related functions. Consumers have become more focused on privacy, and many enterprises believe that their customers will not patronize them if their data is not properly protected.[^6]

Although many privacy teams work with limited resources, the ISACA survey reveals good news: Enterprises are not experiencing more breaches than in the past. Still, privacy teams are smaller this year than last year; considering anticipated budget cuts, privacy professionals who already feel their programs are underfunded are likely to experience more budgetary challenges in 2024.
