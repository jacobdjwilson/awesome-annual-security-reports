Reshaping cloud security begins with 
organizational transformation 

## Introduction
In the first guide for CISOs, Google Cloud Office of the CISO (OCISO) distilled insights gained from our 
experience working with hundreds of customers trying to transform their businesses by moving their 
enterprises to the cloud. Nearly two years later, we’re here to provide an update on the journey and share 
additional lessons learned. 

As we’ve helped more security teams make the move to the cloud, we’ve identified nuanced 
challenges that they face – namely those related to team structure, changing business operations, 
and establishing culture – that are critical to their success
In this guide, we’ve captured insights and recommended practices focused on the organizational and 
operational elements of digital transformation. As you read this guide, please refer to the appendix for 
deeper discussions on security teams before and after digital transformation and the relationship 
between organizational culture and transformation.

### What we’re seeing now
The journey through digital transformation and reinvention regularly involves challenges that many 
leaders and teams have not experienced or even thought of before. Determining which optimizations 
your organization’s structure needs to match your expanding technical capabilities can be daunting, no 
matter how well you plan.  

Organizations are surprised when embracing certain elements of transformation particularly around 
teams, skills, and the jobs to be done in cloud. Perhaps none more so than those who have to change 
their organization and its structure. These changes are often necessary to realign teams to new goals – 
many of which have become shared between teams that may not have worked closely together before. 
At the same time, the introduction of new technologies like cloud, and new ways of automating work, 
with infrastructure-as-code and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), drive new levels 
of work velocity which challenge historical decision-making processes and related forms of governance. 
Teams shift from securing individual systems to securing services and products that are “built into” the 
cloud at speeds never seen before.

01

### Digital transformation defined
Digital transformation uses modern digital technologies, including all types of public, private, and 
hybrid cloud platforms, to create or modify business processes, culture, and customer 
experiences to meet changing business and market dynamics.

Digital transformation spurs a new way of working and optimizing technology, processes, and 
organization toward accelerated business outcomes. Trying to predict what a transformed organization 
model will look like is challenging as there is no single “best practice.”  What’s possible is to set goals on 
what business outcomes one seeks then model, orient, and adjust the organization model to achieve 
those outcomes at the highest velocity, balancing quality, cost, and risk along the way. What’s our answer 
when we get the question, “How should I organize my cloud security team alongside my on-premise 
security team?” We say: it depends. It depends on what the business outcomes an organization wants 
and how much change its willing to endure to get there.

So where do we start when we talk about transforming the cybersecurity organization within a company 
that’s historically delivered security to on-premise systems within a highly centralized function? Ideally, 
we think this conversation should start with defining security goals framed in business outcomes like 
capabilities, velocity, quality, cost, and risk. However, this type of goal framing rarely exists for the 
existing teams in the first place. We think goal setting is critical, but many organizations are faced with a 
different set of challenges that leaders should be aware of.  

### Pre-transformation realities
Working with the “day job”: Many teams just getting started in transformation projects report 
struggling with managing legacy security processes, adopting new technologies like cloud, and all the 
while keeping up with emerging threats and servicing the existing needs of their organization. Adding 
more work to the already busy “day job” is a common, repeated term. 

Reducing toil: What’s also difficult to understand in the early stages of transformation is believing that 
adoption of the cloud will result in less work and a more secure system. Yet, many teams are structured 
to deliver services around tools that secure on-premise systems and follow processes that have 
remained unchanged for years. Many processes and controls have taken years to put into place. Teams 
may remember the pain of putting them in and may not want to change, or worse, these processes have 
become a dangerous source of pride. Moving away from the toil often associated with securing 
on-premise systems can be challenging for unexpected reasons. We think security in the cloud is a 
better future that can be difficult to imagine without inspiration and intentional culture development.

Building new skills: Moving away from these processes can feel expensive and require learning they 
may not have time, interest, or motivation to invest in. Moving on to new platforms like cloud can 
challenge a teams’ existing skill sets, and, when paired without thoughtful or effective training, 
transformation initiatives can pause or stop as a result. Bringing in new team members with cloud skills is 
also challenge. Current estimates taken at the time of this paper indicate there being over 3.5 million 
unfilled job openings for cybersecurity professionals with 700,000 in the US alone. 

Driving to new organization models: Many cybersecurity teams aren’t designed to provide “product” 
security, which is a style of delivering security over the course of its entire life cycle (development, 
delivery, production use, retirement). With so many products existing within an enterprise, trying to 
deliver product-specific security controls in an on-premise network full of various operating systems, 
applications, network designs, operational technologies, and others is infeasible. In the place of an 
application or product-specific security approach, security teams build and deliver horizontal security 
services, like vulnerability scanning, that can detect vulnerabilities in all kinds of infrastructure and 
applications. Once detected, teams struggle to assign vulnerability correction (for example, patching) 
activities to application teams to take action on them.  

Broadly, the activity of “find and assign” security problems to application teams creates slowness and if 
not well managed and governed, results in tremendous waste and worse security outcomes due to 
blurred accountabilities for who’s doing the fix.

Product teams: High-performance product teams have all the skills they need to deliver a secure 
application through development, deployment, production use and retirement. Product teams 
increasingly place the burden of detecting and fixing security problems before they happen on 
themselves. Product teams can deliver platform capabilities (like Identity and Access Management) that 
other product teams (like teams that build inventory or manufacturing systems) consume.   

In evolved organization models, cybersecurity teams might find themselves providing more coaching to 
product teams on how to increase their scope and improve their quality, governing (vs. driving) 
vulnerability mitigation, and providing consulting support around things like threat models.

A successful digital transformation requires a new approach and pushes teams to distribute 
responsibilities, not to centralized teams, but to more product-based teams. This way product teams own 
responsibility for the availability and security of the systems they build and operate.

Maintaining a “single organization” approach to how cybersecurity (or really any function) gets done can 
delay or even stop transformation initiatives from having the impact the organization’s leadership seeks.  
Indeed, failure to transform the organization becomes the most substantial blocker to adopting faster, 
more efficient, and increasingly more secure ways of work. 

It’s important to note that every industry and company operates with its own dynamics and challenges. 
Keep in mind the insights provided here are intended to serve as a flexible guide meant to be adjusted, 
rather than as a prescriptive set of rules for a digital transformation journey.   

### About Office of the CISO 
Office of the CISO (OCISO) brings together senior security leaders and advisors who enable Google 
Cloud customers to securely adopt cloud technologies and transform their organizations. 

We have the singular mission of supporting the secure digital transformation of governments, critical 
infrastructure, enterprises, and small businesses. We work directly with regulators and deeply within 
industries, spanning sectors such as financial services, retail, public sector, telecommunications, media, 
healthcare and life sciences, and digital-first enterprises. We are security leaders, CISOs, researchers, 
engineers, and practitioners who care deeply about securing customers, securing the cloud, and 
securing the planet.

As with anything we do at Google Cloud, we want and appreciate your input and feedback. The 
exchange of best practices and information are essential in navigating the evolving landscape of 
cybersecurity, and we are committed to fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. We invite you 
to send us your feedback.

### About cloud transformation and DevOps
The key to creating faster, more efficient, and increasingly more secure organizations starts with the 
transformation of the organization itself. Many of the concepts covered in this paper are based on our 
collective experience working in cybersecurity engagements where we’ve supported organizations in 
their cloud transformation. Some of the research we use in this paper comes from our annual Accelerate 
State of DevOps Report. 

Each year, these reports feature data gathered directly from tens of thousands of professionals working 
across every industry and in companies of varying sizes. Our Google Cloud DevOps Research and 
Assessment (DORA) engagements and expert teams work with survey respondents to review, compile, 
and publish insights that help teams understand the capabilities that drive software delivery and 
operations performance. The program started in 2014 and was acquired by Google in 2018. As part of 
Google Cloud, we continue our research and help customers on their journeys of continuous 
improvement.

We encourage readers of this paper to explore our most up-to-date DORA research at dora.dev. 

## Mindshift: Security goes cloud first
Here’s something we know to be true: digital transformation isn't just about technology. It’s more about 
transforming the organization, its operations and its technology. Done correctly, digital transformation 
can change who does the work and how it gets done using automation, machine learning, and other 
technology available on the cloud.  

You’ll find many opinions about how cybersecurity enables a successful digital transformation, but most 
observers are unaware of the complexity involved in effectively collaborating and sharing 
responsibilities, skills, tooling, and other capabilities with fast-moving product-based teams who own the 
full set of responsibilities – including cybersecurity – for the applications they build and run.  

Unfortunately for many chief information security officers (CISOs) there’s no one “perfect” operational 
model that an organization can implement coupled with clear recommendations on which responsibility, 
skills, tools, and capabilities become shared and with whom. These shifts depend greatly on factors 
outside of the CISO’s control, including organizational risk appetite, budget, demand for the 
organization’s services, and regulatory perspectives, among other factors. 

02

## Why it’s OOT, not TOO, in the cloud
Our first step in helping customers work through transition to the cloud and more modern ways to work 
starts with backing away from the belief that it’s the technology that’s transforming.

In the earliest days of cloud, organizations looking to transform did so by moving on-premises servers 
(or virtual machines) from their data centers “into the cloud.” The concept of server movement was 
straightforward: create a connection between a data center and a cloud services provider, make a copy 
of the on-premises server, upload the copy to the cloud, initialize copy to a running server, do some 
networking magic, and you were done. Start saving money by shutting the server down when you aren’t 
using it and voilà – Transformation!

Now, services could be acquired without complicated procurement or security processes to slow them 
down. Quickly, organizations deployed new mission-critical services, but without awareness into the 
longer term needs the organization would have for product support or who was now responsible for 
change control and ensuring uptime requirements were met. The speed was great, but questions about 
who was responsible for approving new systems or moving data to the cloud were sometimes answered 
following processes that had been stood up outside of establishing governance channels meant to stop 
proliferation of technical decisions that would result in future pain. In some cases, the rapid acquisition of 
cloud by early adopters led to challenges for security and other support teams who needed to support 
them.  

We’ve studied the stories of success and caution and seen them play out time and again in the Fortune 
500 and beyond. We believe organizations who rapidly transform using cloud – and do so securely – 
succeed by focusing on their initial priorities in this order:

03
Organization
Operations
Technology

We call this O-O-T or “OOT.” As we’ll explain, to avoid suboptimal outcomes, organizations must start 
with understanding their teams, their resources, locations, and constraining factors or conflicts, such as 
goals, incentive structures, and resource limitations, before approaching finalizing technology decisions.

## Choreographing change
Successful transformation starts with an understanding of the goals the organization has for velocity, 
quality, security, risk and capability of its operations. Strong leadership direction, with clear goals and 
measurements, is critical.  

To put the transformation efforts into context, we suggest a four-stage framework. In Appendix C, we 
offer a deeper explanation of what these stages mean when applied organizing cybersecurity teams. 
We use these stages to pinpoint what their challenges are and what progress looks like. This can help 
everyone working in cybersecurity better anticipate and prepare for organization transformation. 

### Organization transformation defined

How organizations think digital transformation goes
The expectation is for a smooth progression through the stages 
of transformation.

Expectations

How organization transformation actually goes
Progress isn’t always smooth, as you’ll often go back and forth between 
stages throughout the transformation as you experiment and optimize 
the work. 

Reality

### The four stages of organization transformation
#### Experimentation and Disintegration
Teams are encouraged and enabled to experiment with new technology and will be able to 
find and demonstrate its value. Teams given autonomy to build without rules find ways to 
reinvent their work. The value and benefit of cloud is teased through these simple 
examples. Excitement about what’s now possible and what could be done on larger scales 
creates the need to disintegrate. 

#### Dissolution
Teams begin to sense that disintegration of the “old way” of doing work (without 
automation, following manual processes, according to traditional ways of organizing 
processes to do work) seem to inhibit the speed that’s possible using cloud. Team norms 
and structures begin to be challenged as organizations start to establish new ways of 
working, new shared goals and outcomes. 

#### Transformation
Now begins the stage of implementing new capabilities that change and eliminate steps 
or entire ways that work was done previously. This move entails significant investment in 
new technologies and systems. This stage can be a long and complex one, as 
organizations need to carefully plan and execute the transformation across entire 
functions, business units, divisions, and the company itself.

#### Integration
Next comes the stage of integrating the new digital business model fully into how the 
organization's day-to-day operations run. Volumes of work go down as the use of 
automation and technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) become more rapidly deployed 
and improved. Organizations shift from building, to maintaining, and finally optimizing 
continuously.

Stage 2

## How security is organized
during transformation
How can we apply this framework to cybersecurity teams? This guide was designed to help teams do 
exactly that. To be as inclusive as possible, we put forward a reasonably comprehensive list of 
cybersecurity teams and functions. No two organizations are the same, and we did not intentionally 
leave any groups out. If you have a question about how a specific role or function transforms, send us 
your feedback.  

You might be surprised to see functions in this list that aren’t typically assigned explicit responsibilities 
for cybersecurity. We’ve included them to show you how functions and their related responsibilities 
change as the security transformation kicks in.

### How to use this guide
In Appendix A, we share explanations and outline how the cybersecurity responsibilities and 
functions transition over the four stages of transformation. 

To use this cybersecurity transformation framework, security leaders should:
1. Select a cross-functional group of individuals who are involved in planning or executing 
security responsibilities within your organization.  
2. Review the stage descriptions and list of key functions, noting which ones exist within your 
security organization today and which do not. Find out where responsibility for certain 
functions exists for each function listed.
    *Note: We expect this to be a difficult activity, as no organization will perfectly match our list 
    of functions and responsibilities. Truly understanding who is responsible and accountable 
    for what and which responsibilities are unclear or not assigned is an important first.*
3. Read the descriptions provided for each function in Appendix A. Determine what stage of 
transformation each individual function is in. (Note: Gather evidence, data, or other facts to 
find the markers and support your determinations.)

4. Share your stage selections with your team and each owner of a critical function that is currently 
outside of your team (or in early stages of forming). Ask:
    *   Do they think the list of functional security responsibilities is complete and accurate?
    *   Do they think the selections of each stage for each function makes sense? 
    *   What would they change, add, remove, or modify to make this specific to your organization?
5. Review the stage-to-stage descriptions in the appendix and reflect on how these functions are 
performed today in light of the organization’s current cloud and non-cloud usage.
6. Identify a target state and select one for each function. Use the appendix to determine how to 
achieve that state. Ask yourself:
    *   Working backwards from the desired end state, what needs to change now to take my 
    organization there? 
    *   What’s our desired state look like?
    *   What organizational, operational, or cultural issues might get in my way?
    *   What processes, including ownership of those processes, must change to achieve the 
    desired state?
    *   What technical barriers exist that we must overcome to achieve that desired end state?
    *   What decisions must get made, and by whom, to initiate and sustain the organization and 
    operational changes needed?
    *   Which of these decisions are directly within your control or outside of your control (or even, 
    outside of your company?)
7. Take the results, socialize with your team, and select end states and target efforts (preferably, 
shared goals with functions that will be changing) to achieve desired results.

Stage 1

### Infrastructure engineering and automation
Infrastructure engineering and automation 
teams focus on discipline around design, build, 
and physical and virtual systems that support 
product infrastructure. These teams address all 
aspects of a product or workload, inclusive of 
security, availability, integrity, capacity, and 
recoverability of all infrastructure. This includes 
everything from the servers and storage 
systems that store data to the networks that 
connect them to the applications and software 
that run on them. Infrastructure engineering 
teams deploy infrastructure and policies using 
code and deployment automation.

### Security engineering and automation
The security engineering and automation team 
plays a vital role in helping organizations 
improve their security posture and reduce the 
risk of security incidents. The team works to 
implement increasingly more secure designs into 
cloud using code. They also help automate 
security tasks, freeing up security professionals 
to focus on more strategic work, and improve 
the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the 
organization's security operations. These teams 
often manage security products under a single 
charter for both on- and off-premises. Teams 
use intelligence to inform and prioritize efforts 
continuously. 

### Detection and response 
The detection and response (D&R) team 
includes security professionals responsible for 
detecting and responding to security incidents. 
The D&R team typically reports to the chief 
information security officer (CISO) or another 
senior security executive.  

Threat intelligence is a critical function that is 
close to and drives D&R activities. Threat 
intelligence (TI) functions can be separate from 
D&R teams or highly integrated. TI is not used 
only by D&R teams but across the full spectrum 
of security, risk, governance, and other 
increasingly data-driven functions.

### Product teams 
A product delivery team is a cross-functional 
team of people responsible for delivering a 
software product to the customer. The team 
typically includes members from the product 
management, software delivery, engineering, 
design, quality assurance, and operations 
departments. Product teams in this model also 
own security features, security tool 
implementation into product workflows, and the 
implementation of security policies into 
products. Product teams can develop and 
deliver all sorts of products – like platform 
services (like IAM), traditional applications, and 
many other things.  

The end goal is a more streamlined organization when transformation is achieved. Here are profiles of 
newly integrated teams and the roles they take on. 

### Integrated risk, compliance, audit
The cross-functional risk, compliance (including 
privacy), and audit teams (inclusive of 
disciplines like information security, privacy, and 
resilience) are responsible for working with 
first-line teams to understand and implement 
controls to mitigate risks. Internal teams audit 
the organization's practices to ensure they 
conform to organization policies and statements 
about risk while also performing other forms of 
advisory and audit work.   

Often mechanisms, such as risk 
appetites/tolerances, risk rating, and 
quantification, developed by these teams are 
used by product, infrastructure, application, and 
other teams to prioritize controls, vulnerabilities, 
incidents, and other work and send them into 
product and engineering teams to implement.  

Increasingly, these teams are using continuous 
monitoring and auditing approaches as well as 
threat intelligence to monitor risks and prioritize 
action.  

Internal audit teams also conduct audits and 
assessments using cloud-first services for 
large-scale data analysis or policy-as-code to 
evaluate the compliance posture of a workload.

### Cloud strategy and governance 
Cloud strategy and governance steering is a 
cross-functional team responsible for approving 
and implementing the organization's cloud 
strategy via projects and products. The team 
typically includes members from the product, IT, 
business, risk, compliance and legal 
departments. These team members are usually 
stakeholders from both the technology and 
business organizations that are leading the 
transformation.  

### Site reliability engineering  
The site reliability engineering (SRE) team is a 
cross-functional arrangement of system experts 
responsible for the reliability, performance, 
availability, scalability, and operational security 
of a company's software systems. The team can 
include members from the engineering, 
operations, security, and DevOps disciplines. 
The mission of the SRE team is to protect, 
provide for, and guide the progress of software 
and systems development.

## Summary
Digital transformation initiatives are both exciting and challenging. While these efforts deliver new 
technologies, they present opportunities to examine and adjust organization structures and operating 
models. 

They provide a chance to re-examine culture, shift focus to the needs of customers and users, acquire 
new skills and methods to deliver and manage technology, set shared goals, and distribute work in new 
ways to new teams.

## Appendix A
Organization descriptions before 
transformation
### Security operations 
Security operations is the practice of combining security and IT operations to improve collaboration 
and reduce risks. Security operations teams are responsible for monitoring, detecting, and 
responding to cyber threats. They also work to prevent security incidents by implementing and 
maintaining security control. Areas of focus:
Profiles of existing teams and their roles
1. Monitor and detect threats – using a 
variety of tools and techniques to monitor 
an organization's networks, systems, and 
applications for signs of malicious activity, 
including monitoring for intrusions, 
unauthorized access, and data exfiltration.
2. Respond to threats –  working to 
respond quickly and effectively to mitigate 
risk when a threat is detected, involving 
isolating the affected system, investigating 
the incident, and addressing the 
vulnerability that was exploited.
3. Detect vulnerabilities – working with 
security engineering and product teams to 
detect and respond to vulnerabilities in a 
cloud environment.

### Threat intelligence
Threat intelligence teams collect, curate, and analyze relevant threat data from various sources. They 
identify and track threat actors, their capabilities, and their targets to inform various teams on how to 
adjust the organization's defenses in response. The teams also share threat intelligence with other 
organizations to identify and mitigate the threat. Areas of focus:
1. Collect and analyze threat data – 
collecting this data from a variety of 
sources, such as open source intelligence, 
social media, and dark web forums and 
then using this data to identify and track 
threat actors, their capabilities, and targets.
2. Develop threat models – describing how 
threat actors may attack an organization, 
which in turn helps organizations to 
understand the threats they face and  
proactively adapt security controls.
3. Share threat intelligence – working 
with other organizations to help them 
protect themselves by way of public 
reports, private briefings, or through 
threat intelligence sharing platforms.

### Cloud security 
Cloud security is the practice of protecting data, applications, and infrastructure that is hosted in the 
cloud. Cloud security teams are responsible for developing and implementing security policies and 
procedures, and monitoring and responding to security incidents. Areas of focus:
1. Develop and implement security policies 
and procedures – working with business 
stakeholders to develop and implement 
security policies and procedures that are 
specific to an organization's cloud 
environment, addressing security concerns 
such as access control, data encryption, 
and incident response.
2. Monitor cloud environments for security 
threats and vulnerabilities – using tools 
and techniques for detecting unauthorized 
access, malicious activity, 
misconfigurations, and data exfiltration. 
3. Secure infrastructure and infrastructure 
as code – using languages like Terraform 
and other tools, implement cloud-first 
security architecture and technologies and 
ensure technology choices made by 
product teams continuously improve 
product resilience.
4. Educate employees on cloud security best 
practices – including training employees on 
how to identify and report security threats.

### Security architecture
Security architecture is the practice of designing, developing, and implementing a security framework 
that protects an organization's assets from cyber threats. Security architecture teams are responsible 
for defining an organization's security requirements, designing and implementing security controls, and 
ensuring that the security framework is continuously monitored and updated. Areas of focus:
1. Define security requirements – working 
with business stakeholders to define 
security requirements, including identifying 
assets, understanding the threats to those 
assets, and assessing risk tolerance.
2. Design security controls – designing and 
implementing controls to protect an organization’s 
assets from cyber threats with a focus on firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, encryption, and 
access control.
3. Implement security controls – following 
working with operations teams to 
implement newly designed security 
controls, including configuring the controls, 
testing for effectiveness, and monitoring 
for compliance.

### Incident response 
Incident response teams own the process of responding, containing, and resolving security incidents. 
Incident response teams must respond to security incidents rapidly to minimize the damage and impact. 
Areas of focus:
1. Investigate incidents – working to 
investigate a detected incident to determine 
the scope and potential impact.
2. Contain incidents – working to contain an 
incident to prevent further damage. Involving 
isolating the affected system, blocking access, 
and removing the malicious code.
3. Eradicate threats – evicting bad actors, 
addressing the immediate vulnerability that 
was exploited and restoring the affected 
system to its original state. 
4. Learn from incidents – improving the incident 
response process, including documenting the 
incident, analyzing the incident, and developing 
recommendations for improvement.

### Data protection 
Data protection is the practice of securing data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction. Data protection teams are responsible for implementing and maintaining 
controls to protect an organization's data. Areas of focus:
1. Identify and classify data – focusing on all 
data that needs to be protected, identifying 
data type, sensitivity, and value. 
2. Develop data protection standards – 
developing and recommending security 
controls to protect the data, including 
implementing access control, encryption, 
and backup.
3. Train teams on data protection – ensuring 
that users are awareness of data protection 
requirements.
4. Monitoring control effectiveness – being 
prepared to respond to data protection 
violations and incidents with a plan in place to 
identify and contain them.

### Identity and access management 
Identity and access management (IAM) practices ensure that only authorized users have access to an 
organization's systems and data. Areas of focus:
1. Define identity and access management 
policies and procedures – including 
defining the different types of users, their 
roles and responsibilities, and the levels of 
access needed.
2. Implement identity and access management 
controls – following the definition of identity 
and access management policies and 
procedures, implementing controls to enforce 
the policies such as implementing access 
control lists, multi-factor authentication, and 
password policies.
3. Monitor and audit identity and access 
management controls – ensuring effective

### Product management 
Product management teams define, develop, launch, and maintain a product or service. Efforts often 
include end user support, integrations, and even support for go-to-market and sales teams looking to 
expand the products usage. Areas of focus:
1. Define the product vision – in collaboration 
with the rest of the team, developing a vision 
statement of what the product is and what it 
hopes to achieve.
2. Implement security features – ensuring 
products have security features that are 
enabled by default and designed into the 
product in its earliest stages.
3. Build, deliver, and operate products – in 
collaboration with operations teams, 
ensuring the product is stable, secure, 
compliant, and continuously monitored.
4. Work with engineers and designers – bringing 
the product vision to life through design 
feedback, prioritizing features, and managing 
the product development process.
5. Manage the product life cycle – including 
tracking product usage and collecting customer 
feedback.

### Application management and support 
Application management is the process of ensuring that software applications are running smoothly and 
efficiently. It includes tasks such as monitoring application performance, troubleshooting problems, and 
applying security patches. Application management teams are responsible for ensuring that applications 
are available to users when they need them and that they are performing at their best.

Application support is the process of providing assistance to users of software applications. This 
includes tasks such as answering questions, resolving problems, and providing training. Application 
support teams are responsible for ensuring that users are able to use applications effectively and 
efficiently. Application management and support teams typically work together to ensure that software 
applications are running smoothly and efficiently. Application management teams focus on the technical 
aspects of application management, while application support teams focus on the user-facing aspects 
of application support. Areas of focus:
1. Monitor application performance – 
ensuring that applications are running within 
acceptable levels through the collection of 
data on application metrics, such as CPU 
usage, memory usage, and database activity.
2. Troubleshoot problems – troubleshooting 
problems when they occur, identifying the 
cause and finding a solution through activities 
such as reviewing logs, analyzing data, and 
performing tests.
3. Apply improvements – protecting 
applications from vulnerabilities by  
identifying and downloading patches, 
testing patches, and deploying patches to 
production environments.
4. Answer questions – offering support on how to 
use applications by providing information about 
application features, troubleshooting problems, 
and training.
5. Resolve problems – addressing problems 
that users may experience with applications 
by troubleshooting problems, providing 
workarounds, and escalating problems to 
application management teams.
6. Provide training – creating training materials, 
delivering training sessions, and answering 
questions from users on how to
