## Security at the epicenter of innovation

Security at the epicenter of innovation: That’s not the world we live in today, but what if it were?

While excitement and budgets are rising for cutting-edge security programmes, progress on actually improving security is sluggish, even stagnant.

PwC’s 2024 Global Digital Trust Insights survey of 3,876 business and tech executives at the largest global companies — 30% of respondents have revenues of $10 billion or more — shows considerable room for improvement in cybersecurity.

Consider these findings. Breach costs and the number of high-dollar breaches continue to increase. Although cloud attacks are the top cyber concern, about one-third of organisations have no risk management plan to address cloud service provider challenges. Only half are ‘very satisfied’ with their technology capabilities in key cybersecurity areas. More than 30% of companies don’t consistently follow what should be standard practices of cyber defence.

Imagine a world with security at the epicenter of innovation — the field where bright ideas and bold ambitions flourish. Imagine the CISO right there, working to secure the organisation’s lofty ambitions and prized assets.

We note 179 respondents who seem to be doing just that. These top 5% — our stewards of digital trust — are reaping benefits that others are missing. They’re experiencing fewer breaches, and the attacks that do hit them aren’t as costly. Managing risk is easier because they’ve streamlined their security solutions. And they’ve positioned themselves for greater productivity and faster growth, outpacing the competition as they plunge into new technologies with confidence that they are well protected.

## Meet our stewards of digital trust

![Chart showing the consistency of cybersecurity team actions, comparing the Top 5% (Stewards of Digital Trust) against all respondents. The Top 5% score significantly higher (84%-96%) across all categories compared to the average (21%-30%).]

**Percentage who say that their cyber teams ‘usually’ (80% to 100% of the time) do this:**[^1]

| Action | Top 5% | All Respondents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Responds quickly to threats so our organisation can emerge stronger from disruptions | 96% | 30% |
| Incorporates data security and privacy features into products, services, and third-party relationships | 94% | 25% |
| Puts controls in place throughout the organisation to prevent serious cyber disruptions | 96% | 28% |
| Allocates cyber budget to the top risks of the organisation | 91% | 23% |
| Maintains relationships with public sector at all administrative levels to build resilience | 88% | 23% |
| Collaborates with other parts of the business that affect the organisation’s cybersecurity posture | 85% | 21% |
| Anticipates future cyber risks, given the macro environment and the business strategy | 93% | 22% |
| Communicates our cyber strategy and practices in a way that helps our organisation earn trust | 91% | 24% |
| Expedites digital and other major transformation initiatives (e.g., security by design) | 84% | 21% |

With technology now at the heart of business, safeguarding it is tantamount to protecting the enterprise. That’s why in 2023, PwC created a playbook for C-level executives to help each C-level executive focus on the questions they need to answer with their CISO.

We’ve updated the playbook for 2024. This is likely to be a watershed year. Cybersecurity faces four major shifts, each of which could be disruptive on its own:

*   **C-suite insistence** on modernising and improving technology infrastructure and investments in a year of cost-cutting and macroeconomic uncertainty.
*   **A groundbreaking new technology — generative AI** — bringing new threats as well as unprecedented promise for defence.
*   **Regulations requiring openness** about cyber incidents and risk management practices that could usher in a new era of transparency and collaboration.
*   **The rise of hybrid cyber threats** and the blurring of the line between espionage and cybercrime, propelling cyber defence more fully into the national security arena.

## 9 degrees of separation: top performers vs the rest

The Top 5% are:
*   **6x more likely** to have already implemented transformative cybersecurity initiatives from which they are realising benefits.
*   **5x more likely** to be very satisfied with their current cyber technology capabilities.
*   **4x more likely** to be continually updating their risk management plan to mitigate cloud risks.
*   **9x more likely** to be mature in their cyber resilience practices.

The Top 5% are more likely to:
*   **Invest more into cyber budget**, with 85% increasing their cyber budget in 2024 (vs 79% overall), of which 19% are increasing cyber budget in 2024 by 15% or more, compared to 10% overall.
*   **Strongly agree** their organisation will develop new lines of business using generative AI (GenAI) (49% vs 33% overall).
*   **Plan to deploy GenAI tools** for cyber defence (44% vs 27%).
*   **Disagree** that ‘GenAI will lead to a catastrophic cyber attack’ (33% vs 22% overall).
*   **Say their most damaging cyber breach** in the last three years cost them less than $100k (28% vs 19% overall).

## Cyber risk management: Ripe for reinvention

Innovation means making bold moves, and there’s nothing more empowering than knowing that you’ve done what’s possible to remain safe and secure — that you’ve assessed and addressed your most important cyber risks.

Mitigating cyber risk is a top priority for 2024. After dropping to fourth place in last year’s PwC CEO Survey, it’s now second for our respondents, behind only digital and technology risks.

### Digital tops the risk list in two ways
**Risk mitigation priorities over the next 12 months (Ranked top three):**[^2]

1.  **Digital and technology risks**: 51% (Adverse consequence from new or frontier technologies, inability to execute digital transformation).
2.  **Cyber risks**: 43% (Hacking, ransomware, surveillance).
3.  **Macroeconomic volatility**: 41% (Demand and supply shocks, debt crises, asset bubble burst).

[^2]: Q1. Which of the following risks is your organisation prioritising for mitigation over the next 12 months? Base: All respondents = 3876.

## Everything is connected, including cyber attacks

Once malicious actors break into systems and networks, they often wreak havoc in as many ways as possible. What may start as a cloud breach could become an advanced persistent threat. They might exfiltrate data, launch ransomware, and then leak the data ("hack and leak") even if the ransom is paid.

### Top cyber threats over the next 12 months (Ranked top three):[^3]
*   Cloud-related threats: 47%
*   Attacks on connected devices: 42%
*   Hack-and-leak operations: 37%
*   Business email compromise/account takeovers: 29%
*   Ransomware: 29%
*   Software supply-chain compromise: 25%
*   Third-party breach: 23%

[^3]: Q3. Over the next 12 months, which of the following cyber threats is your organisation most concerned about? Base: All respondents = 3876.

### Breaches are becoming more costly
The percentage of those reporting costs of $1 million or more for their worst breach in the past three years rose to **36%** (from 27% last year).

**Estimated costs of most damaging data breach:**
*   $1M - $9M: 23% (up from 16% in 2023)
*   $10M - $19M: 9% (up from 7% in 2023)
*   $20M or more: 4% (consistent with 2023)

**Average cost of breach by sector:**
*   Healthcare: $5.3M (47% say $1M+)
*   Tech, Media & Telecomm: $4.8M (43% say $1M+)
*   Financial Services: $5.0M (38% say $1M+)
*   Energy, Utilities & Resources: $4.2M (37% say $1M+)
*   Indust. & Auto: $4.1M (33% say $1M+)
*   Retail & Consumer: $3.2M (28% say $1M+)

## Simplification of cyber tools: The bane of bad actors

Modernisation and optimisation top the cyber-investment priorities for 2024. 49% of business leaders selected technology modernisation, and 45% chose optimisation of existing investments.

In the 2024 survey, 44% report using an integrated suite of cyber tech solutions, and 39% plan to move to one in the next two years. 19% say they have too many cyber solutions and need to consolidate. Software that doesn’t work together can hinder performance and require more time to manage.

## 2024 cyber budgets aim to make the most of existing tools

**Cybersecurity investment priorities (Ranked top three):**[^4]
*   Modernisation of technology, including cyber infrastructure: 49%
*   Optimisation of current technology and investments: 45%
*   Ongoing improvements in risk posture based on cyber roadmap: 42%
*   Ongoing security training: 40%

[^4]: Q14b. Which of the following investments are you prioritising when allocating your organisation’s cyber budget? Base: Business respondents = 1925.

**Only half are satisfied with their cyber-tech capabilities:**[^5]
*   Networking / Firewall / VPN: 56%
*   Cloud security: 53%
*   Security management and governance: 52%
*   Endpoint detection and response: 52%
*   Data security and privacy: 52%
*   Identity and access management: 50%
*   Supply chain security: 43%
*   SOAR: 42%
*   Industrial IoT and control systems: 41%
*   **Only 5% of security and IT respondents are very satisfied across all areas.**

[^5]: Q23. How satisfied are you with your organisation's technology capabilities in the following areas? Base: Security and IT respondents = 1517.

## Cloud security: Overdue for concerted attention

Cloud security is the No. 1 cyber risk concern for 47% of respondents. Despite this, nearly every organisation (97%) has gaps in its cloud risk management plan. Only 3% maintain up-to-date plans that address all nine key cloud security areas.

**Organisation’s position on cloud service provider challenges:**[^6]
*   **Disaster recovery and back-up**: 38% (Updated plan), 31% (Yet to address).
*   **Shared responsibility**: 32% (Updated plan), 35% (Yet to address).
*   **Third-party risk**: 33% (Updated plan), 36% (Yet to address).
*   **Concentration risk**: 28% (Updated plan), 41% (Yet to address).
*   **Fragmented regulations**: 27% (Updated plan), 42% (Yet to address).

[^6]: Q19. To what extent has your organisation addressed the following challenges with your cloud service provider(s)? Base: Cloud provider users = 3648.

## Generative AI for cyber defence on the rise

69% say they’ll use GenAI for cyber defence in the next 12 months. 47% are already using it for cyber risk detection and mitigation.

**Three promising areas for GenAI in cyber defence:**
1.  **Threat detection and analysis**: Proactively detecting vulnerability exploits and identifying patterns that elude traditional systems.
2.  **Cyber risk and incident reporting**: Using NLP to turn technical data into concise content for non-technical stakeholders.
3.  **Adaptive controls**: Recommending and validating security policies and automating controls tailored to the threat profile.

## Regulations: Providing a safe place to play and grow

About a third of respondents agree that regulation can give companies added confidence to explore and compete.

**Regulatory goals with the greatest impact on future growth (Ranked top three):**[^7]
*   Regulation of artificial intelligence: 37%
*   Harmonised cyber and data protection laws: 36%
*   Mandatory reporting of cyber risk management, strategy, and governance: 35%
*   Harmonised privacy rights: 32%
*   Regulatory requirements for operational resilience: 32%

[^7]: Q24. Which of the following proposed regulatory goals and principles will have the greatest impact on your organisation's ability to secure future revenue growth? Base: All respondents = 3876.

## The slow progress on cyber resilience

**Extent of implementation for key resilience actions:**[^8]

*   **Only 2% are optimising and continuously improving across all areas.**

[^8]: Q8. To what extent is your organisation implementing or planning to implement the following cyber resilience actions? Base: All respondents = 3876.

## Dare to break cyber-as-usual: The 2024 C-suite playbook

Most companies are still locked into "cyber-as-usual": fragmented initiatives and technological complexities.

**Implementation of Cybersecurity Initiatives:**[^9]
*   **Shifting to zero trust concept**: 25% (Realising benefits), 28% (Implemented but no benefits yet).
*   **Using GenAI in risk detection**: 28% (Realising benefits), 26% (Implemented but no benefits yet).
*   **Creating/improving BISO roles**: 24% (Realising benefits), 27% (Implemented but no benefits yet).
*   **Integrating with resilience strategy**: 22% (Realising benefits), 27% (Implemented but no benefits yet).

[^9]: Q10. To what extent is your organisation implementing or planning to implement the following cybersecurity initiatives? Base: All respondents = 3876.

## Action Items for the C-suite

### Speak a new language
**Roles: CISO, CFO, GC**
Dare to talk about cyber in business-speak, tech-speak, or finance-speak. Avoid mystifying terms like "attack surface" or "zero trust" when speaking to the board. Use common vocabularies to help executives wrestle with trade-offs.

### Try bold, new ways of managing cyber risk
**Roles: CISO, CRO, IA, CCO, COO**
Use sophisticated risk modeling specific to your sector. Create risk-linked performance incentives for employees to build a risk culture. Consider modern bug bounty programmes.

### Shape guardrails
**Roles: CISO, CIO, GC, RA**
Speak the language of trust, not just compliance. Involve yourself early in regulatory processes regarding AI, the metaverse, and privacy to ensure they boost rather than hinder success.

### Free your teams for creative thinking
**Roles: CISO, CIO, CTO, CRO, COO**
Use automation, GenAI, and managed services to perform mundane chores. Liberated from tedious tasks, your people can focus on thwarting evolving threats.

### Welcome cyber into the boardroom
**Roles: CISO, Board, CEO**
Ensure cyber is a staple topic, not just regarding risks and controls, but how strategic initiatives further revenue growth. Security provides the underpinnings for finance, development, and technology.

### Think like the business owner
**Roles: CISO, CEO**
Embrace cyber as a whole-of-business endeavor. Safeguard the brand and use cybersecurity to spur innovations that save money and help the business grow.
