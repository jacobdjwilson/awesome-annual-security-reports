## Introduction

Welcome to the fourteenth annual NetDiligence® Cyber Claims Study. This report is based on the summary statistical analysis of over 10,000 cyber claims for incidents that occurred during the five-year period 2019–2023. By comparison, the first Cyber Claims Study, published in 2010, analyzed fewer than 100 cyber insurance claims.

### By the Numbers

*   10,464 claims analyzed, arising from incidents occurring 2019–2023
*   4,991 new and updated claims collected in 2023, from incidents occurring 2021–2023
*   1,301 claims analyzed arising from incidents occurring in 2023
*   98% of claims ($1.9B in total) from small to medium enterprises (SMEs) with less than $2 billion in annual revenue
*   2% of claims ($2.0B in total) from large companies with more than $2 billion in annual revenue
*   2,754 claims due to ransomware, 54% of which occurred between 2021 and 2023
*   1,714 claims due to business email compromise, 56% of which occurred between 2021 and 2023

## Key Findings

*   We see enormous variances in the magnitude of loss data. The smallest claims were less than $1,000; the largest were over $500M. The numbers of records exposed ranged from 1 to over 140M.
*   The dataset contains 5 claims >$100M, 40 claims $10M–$99M, and 361 claims $1M–$10M. Of the 5 claims >$100M, two occurred at organizations with <$700M in annual revenue.
*   There were dramatic differences between the numbers for SMEs and for large companies—multiples of 10x, 1000x, or more. The biggest large company in the dataset (over $230B in annual revenue) was approximately 23 million times larger than the smallest organization (less than $12K in annual revenue). The average large company ($13.3B in annual revenue) was more than 140 times larger than the average SME ($93M).
*   Even though large companies represented only 2% of claims (N=222), these claims accounted for 51% of the total incident cost analyzed in the report ($2.0B/$3.9B).
*   In SMEs, there were 327 claims ≥$1M. In large companies, there were 79 claims ≥$1M
*   Ransomware and business email compromise were the two leading causes of loss. They accounted for 53% of claims ≥$1K in the five-year period 2019–2023, and nearly 39% to date in 2023.
*   Ransoms continue to be off the charts, with initial demands as high as $80M and ransoms paid as high as $50M. There were 15 ransoms paid ≥$10M.
*   Industry concern about third-party events is on the rise. We plan to collect additional data in future studies so that we may provide more specific information about cause of loss in these cases.

## Company Size

![Figure 2: Average Costs for All Claims (SMEs vs. Large Companies)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Average Costs for All Claims

### SMEs
Crisis Services (N=6,438): $96K
Legal/Regulatory (N=226): $24K
Incident (N=8,278): $205K

### Large Companies
Crisis Services (N=97): $2.0M
Legal/Regulatory (N=15): $25.7M
Incident (N=158): $12.7M

## TERMS

*   **Breach Coach**: A qualified data security and privacy attorney who provides legal guidance for cyber incident response.
*   **Crisis Services Costs**: Costs associated with responding to the breach event. These costs include, but are not limited to, Breach Coach counsel, forensics, notification, credit/ID monitoring, and public relations.
*   **Incident Cost**: Because the proportion of “recordless” events is so large, we replaced the term “breach” with “incident.” The term Incident Cost in this report means the aggregate total of all types of costs/expenses associated with the incident.
*   **Legal Costs**: Legal and regulatory expenses incurred due to the event. These costs include, but are not limited to, lawsuit defense, lawsuit settlement, regulatory action defense, and regulatory fines.
*   **Self-Insured Retention (SIR)**: The dollar amount that the insured organization had to pay before the insurer paid anything on the claim. In this study, the SIR is included in Incident Cost.
*   **Small to Medium Enterprise (SME)**: Categorized in this study as organizations with less than $2 billion in annual revenue.
*   **Large Company**: Categorized in this study as organizations with $2 billion or more in annual revenue.

All findings are for the five-year period 2019–2023 unless otherwise noted.

## Ransoms Demanded vs Ransoms Paid

![Figure 3: Ransoms Demanded vs Ransoms Paid (SMEs vs. Large Companies)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

### SMEs
Max Demand vs Max Paid: $80.0M vs $40.0M

### Large Companies
Max Demand vs Max Paid: $66.0M vs $50.0M

## Average Costs for Business Interruption

![Figure 4: Average Costs for Business Interruption (SMEs vs. Large Companies)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

In 2023, our data reveals some interesting contrasts —both positives and negatives—in the cyber claims landscape, especially for SMEs across various industries. While we’ve seen a significant increase in incident costs for business email compromise claims, there’s also been a reduction in losses related to general “hacker” incidents. Some additional positive trends noted include: wire fraud costs have steadily declined since 2020; healthcare SMEs appear to have continued to benefit from decreasing average incident costs; and manufacturing SMEs saw their costs drop to a five-year low. Conversely, the financial services sector appears to have experienced a sharp increase in incident costs, which continues to underscore the fact that cyber risk can—and usually does—evolve in different ways for different sectors.

![Figure 6: Average Incident Cost by Cause of Loss (Top 5 SMEs)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## An Overview of the Data

The claims analyzed in this study come from organizations of all sizes, the smallest with less than $12K in annual revenue and the largest with over $230B. As the dataset is overwhelmingly weighted with claims from smaller companies, this may dilute the findings for large companies. Likewise, large companies can function as outliers, skewing the findings for small organizations. Therefore, the dataset has been divided into two categories based on the size of the insured entity. Organizations with less than $2B in annual revenue are defined as small to medium enterprises (SMEs), while those with $2B or greater in annual revenue are defined as large companies.

55% of study participants provided estimates of the annual revenue of the insured entities. Analysis of this data provides the following company demographics:

*   **SMEs**: annual revenue ranged from less than $12K to $1.9B. The average was $93M. SMEs accounted for 98% of claims but only 49% of total incident cost.
*   **Large companies**: annual revenue ranged from $2B to more than $230B. The average was $13.3B. Large companies accounted for only 2% of claims but 51% of total incident cost.

![Figure 8: Proportion of Cost by Company Size (2019–2023)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Claims by Year of Event

The study includes 10,464 incidents occurring 2019-2023. The incident distribution by year is depicted in Figure 9.

The claims analyzed in this report come from incidents at organizations in 7 revenue groupings and 18 business sectors, across 25 causes of loss and 13 types of data.

Demographic analyses are based on all 10,464 claims while cost analyses are based upon the 8,414 claims that reported incident cost ≥$1,000.

![Figure 9: Percentage of Claims by Year (N=10,464)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Incident Cost and Payout

Study participants were asked to provide information about the amount of money paid on a claim and to give an estimate of the total cost of the incident, including self-insured retention (SIR) and other costs that may have been excluded due to the terms of the policy.

The largest incident at a large company occurred in 2021 (>$500M). Between 2019 and 2022, there were 9 claims at large companies with over $50M in total incident cost, and another 11 claims with $10M-$50M in total incident cost.

There were 327 SME claims over $1M, and another 307 claims $500K–$1M. The largest SME claims occurred in 2022 (>$100M). These incidents happened in the manufacturing and healthcare sectors. Both involved ransomware with very large ransoms and extremely large business interruption losses (>$90M). Neither company was extremely large—annual revenue for each was <$700M.

Please note: because each of these claims was an extreme outlier, both have been excluded from the analysis of all SME claims.

Payouts for all organization sizes covered 47% of the total incident cost. For SMEs, the five-year payout was 81% of the total incident cost. At large companies, this number was 24%.

Figures 10 and 11 provide year-by-year averages of payout versus total cost, plus the five-year averages of payout amount and total incident cost for both SMEs and large companies.

![Figure 10: Average Payout and Incident Cost - SMEs (N=8,278)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

The cost of cyber insurance claims remains significant, making addressing the issues leading to high payouts crucial. The ~$40k gap and significant correlation between incident costs and payouts underscores the particular value of cyber insurance in mitigating issues, helping insureds avoid uncovered costs. Organizations must continue to move beyond a reactive stance and adopt a proactive, holistic approach to cyber risk.

The cyber insurance industry continues to be in a unique position to affect critical change within the information security industry. The number and type of claims emanating from third party incidents, such as claims from thousands of businesses affected by “industry” incidents like the MOVEit Transfer, Change Healthcare and CDK Global events, will be substantial—with significant economic impact to carriers. This impact clearly justifies additional inquiry into third party risk during the underwriting process. It highlights the need to require prospective insureds to have vendor management programs and to provide proof of these programs during the underwriting process. Doing so will not only facilitate more secure networks but will also produce much better underwriting risks.

## Incident and Crisis Services Costs

For all organizations, crisis services costs ranged from less than $100 to almost $26M. Incident cost for these claims, inclusive of SIR, ranged from less than $1,000 to almost $110M. The averages were influenced by some very expensive claims. Not every claim involves a crisis services element, causing the number of claims or the “N” values on the graphs to vary.

### SMEs

At SMEs, average crisis services costs ranged from $69K in 2019 to $146K in 2023, as shown in Figure 12. Over five years, crisis services costs for SMEs averaged about 51% of total cost, as shown in Figure 13.

![Figure 12: Average Crisis Services and Incident Costs Where Crisis Services Costs >0 - SMEs (N=4,759)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

Rapid response, combined with the most comprehensive and accurate information, is crucial in mitigating cybersecurity issues as they arise. Continuous portfolio monitoring helps insurers identify affected organizations before notifications arrive, providing incident responders with the data they need to act quickly. Swift and effective action enables insurers to reduce both professional service costs and business interruption impacts.

Ben Duffy, KYND

![Figure 13: Crisis Services as a Percentage of Incident Cost Where Crisis Services Costs >0 - SMEs (N=4,759)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

![Figure 14: Average Crisis Services Costs - SMEs (N=4,759)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

Figures 14 (above) and 15 (below) depict average crisis services costs by individual component, as well as the percentage of total crisis services cost that each component represents. During the five-year period, forensics accounted for 22% of the total, and legal guidance accounted for another 10% of the total. “Other” crisis services include the costs of PR, data restoration, and sometimes the cost of ransom.

![Figure 15: Distribution of Crisis Services Costs - SMEs (N=4,759)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

### Large Companies:

Figure 16 illustrates considerable variability in both the average crisis services cost and the incident cost at large companies. Here, average incident cost ranged from $3.1M to $14M. Additionally, an outlier event in 2021 caused a spike in the average crisis services and incident costs.

Figure 17 shows crisis service cost as a percent of total cost. Over the five-year period, this percentage ranged from 20% to 60%, with an average of 28%. The previous five-year period showed a similar average (26% from 2018-2022).

Figure 18 breaks down crisis services costs into a variety of service components.

![Figure 18: Distribution of Crisis Services Costs Where Crisis Services Costs >0 - Large Companies (N=97)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Business Interruption (BI)

### SMEs

BI costs were reported for 3151 incidents. Since 2019, the average BI cost and corresponding average incident cost have remained high. The decrease in 2023 shown in the graph below is most likely a result of a smaller set of claims collected so far for 2023.

Further, ransomware incidents at SMEs accounted for 91% of claims with a BI component. The five-year average BI cost for ransomware incidents was $487K with a total incident cost of $995K. In 2023, these numbers were $593K and $1.3M, respectively.

### Large Companies

Additional analysis shows that the five-year average incident cost of a claim with BI was over 450% greater than a claim without BI. In 2023, the average claim involving BI was 270% greater than one that did not.

Figure 19 depicts average BI and total incident cost at large companies. Though the number of claims is small and there is much variability, the numbers are substantial, especially in 2022.

![Figure 19: Average Business Interruption Cost - SMEs (N=313)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)
*1Although 315 claims reported BI losses, very large incidents at 2 organizations have been excluded from this analysis, resulting in 313 incidents analyzed.

![Figure 20: Average Business Interruption Cost - Large Companies (2019–2023) (N=16)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

We continue to see SME clients transform their businesses to be more reliant on digital systems while failing to understand the inherent risks that come from complex digital ecosystems. This becomes very evident during the recovery process for a client where it’s clear they haven’t planned for resilience in their digital platform nor practiced operating their business processes during a crisis scenario. Helping educate companies on their digital systemic risks and build a proper resiliency plan for the business is vital.

Alden Hutchison, Principal, RSM US LLP

## Recovery Expense

### SMEs

252 claims reported recovery expense. As Figure 21 shows, both recovery expense and total incident cost has been steadily increasing since 2019. The average five-year incident cost of these claims is about 350% higher than incidents without recovery expense. In 2022, the incident cost was over 400% greater when recovery expense was incurred.

Ransomware incidents accounted for 85% of the claims with reported recovery expense. The five-year average incident cost of these events was 350% higher than incidents without recovery expense. In 2023, these incidents cost almost 400% more.

### Large Companies

Seven large company claims reported recovery expense. Recovery expense for these incidents ranged from <$20K to $4.5M (average=$953K). The corresponding incident cost ranged from <$25K to $28M (average $11.3M). Five of these were due to ransomware and one was due to malware.

So far, we have collected no claims with recovery expense in 2023. That may change next year as we collect additional data for 2023.

![Figure 21: Average Recovery Expense - SMEs (N=252)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Legal Costs

### SMEs

There were 226 claims in the dataset that reported legal or litigation expense from one or more category: legal settlement, legal defense, regulatory fines, and regulatory action. Figure 22 depicts the year-by-year averages for these four categories as well as their five-year averages. There was much year-by-year variability in these costs.

### Large Companies

The dataset contained only 12 claims reporting at least one type of legal or litigation expense. For the five-year period, the overall average was $25.7M, with a maximum of over $500M (settlement). This large settlement drives up the overall averages. Average settlement defense cost was $747K. There was only one regulatory fine in the five-year data ($21M).

![Figure 22: Average Legal Costs - SMEs (N=226)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Records Exposed

When looking at the five-year window, we see both the number of claims reporting records exposed and the overall number of records going down. The 2019–2023 range contains 436 claims that reported more than one² record exposed, whereas the 2018–2022 range contained 611 of these claims. Similarly, the total reported number of records exposed dropped 20% since last year’s report.

We cannot pinpoint why the number of claims with exposed records is decreasing, nor can we say whether this represents a change in exposure or a change in reporting. However, we can speculate:

*   The large proportion of ransomware and BEC claims since 2020 do not involve exposed records.
*   Perhaps (as we have speculated in the past) the lack of utility of per record metrics is causing insurers to be less concerned with the number of records than they once were.

Figures 23 and 24 illustrate the number of exposed records year-by-year and with a five-year average. There is no clear pattern. As found in previous NetDiligence Cyber Claims reports, the number of records exposed does not correlate well with either the size of an organization or the total incident cost.

²Claims with blank, 0, or 1 records exposed were excluded from this sub-analysis.

![Figure 23: Average Number of Records Exposed - SMEs (N=408)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

Experiencing a data breach can understandably be alarming, but it’s essential for consumers not to feel discouraged. Today, there are a wealth of identity protection and fraud resolution resources available to assist those affected. These tools are designed to help consumers navigate the aftermath of a data breach, offering comprehensive support to prevent identity theft and fraud.

Michael Bruemmer, Head of Global Data Breach Resolution & VP of Consumer Protection, Experian.

![Figure 24: Average Number of Records Exposed - Large Companies (N=28)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Recordless Claims and Claims with Exposed Records

“Recordless” claims are incidents that do not expose records. Ransomware, business email compromise (BEC), wire transfer fraud, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), and theft of money accounted for most of these incidents—91% over five years.

Please note that in a certain number of incidents, study participants indicated that records were exposed but did not provide a number. We included these incidents in the records exposed analysis here but excluded them from the number of records analysis above.

As Figure 25 shows, the average incident cost for each category is about the same over five years.

![Figure 25: Average Incident Costs – Records Exposed vs Recordless - SMEs (N=3,600)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Criminal and Non-Criminal Activities

Criminal activities include:

*   Hacking
*   Ransomware
*   Social Engineering
*   Business Email Compromise (BEC)
*   Phishing

Non-criminal events include:

*   Staff Mistakes
*   Mishandling of Paper Records
*   Improper Disclosure
*   Lost Laptops
*   Programming Errors
*   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
*   System Glitches
*   Stolen Devices
*   Theft of Money
*   Banking/ACH Fraud
*   Legal Actions

![Figure 26: Criminal vs Non-Criminal – Percentage of Claims - SMEs (N=7,759)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

There are fewer and fewer non-criminal incidents, which may be attributed to better employee training and more sophisticated controls. At SMEs, the proportion of claims caused by criminal activities was 90% in 2019. Since then, the proportion has been ≥97%. (Figure 26, above)

Over five years, criminal incidents at SMEs were, on average, much more costly than non-criminal incidents. Four large events in 2022 involving wrongful data collection and trademark infringement (incident cost between $3M and $5M) caused the non-criminal average cost in that year to exceed the criminal average cost by a large margin. (Figure 27, below)

Comparisons of criminal to non-criminal incidents at large companies are outlined in Figures 28 and 29 below. Here, we see that 86% of incidents reported at large companies involved criminal activity. The cost of criminal incidents was dramatically higher than the cost of non-criminal ones.

![Figure 27: Criminal vs Non-Criminal —Average Cost - SMEs (N=7,759)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

AI is supercharging cyberattacks, making them more sophisticated and rapid than ever before. As hackers leverage AI to enhance their capabilities, it’s imperative for organizations to elevate their defenses. Regularly testing and updating your cybersecurity measures is no longer optional—it’s essential. The stakes are higher, and staying ahead requires a proactive and rigorous approach to security, ensuring that your defenses are both robust and resilient against evolving threats.

## Self-Insured Retentions (SIR)

The dataset contained 5,233 claims for SMEs that provided an amount for SIR. These amounts ranged $0–$10M. Year-by-year averages are shown below.

The dataset contained 121 claims for large companies that reported an amount for SIR. These amounts ranged $0–$10M. The year-by-year averages are shown below. The average SIR in 2023 was almost double the SIR amount in 2020.

![Figure 31: Average SIR - Large Companies (N=121)](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

## Causes of Loss

The top four causes of loss at SMEs were:

*   Ransomware
*   Business Email Compromise (BEC)
*   Hackers
*   Wire Transfer Fraud

Losses in these four categories accounted for 68% of claims and 84% of total incident cost ($1.5B). For metrics on all sectors, please see the graphs and tables in the appendices.

![Figure 32: Top Causes of Loss - SMEs](https://i.imgur.com/your_image_link_here.png)

Ransomware remains a dominant and costly cyber threat for companies, but efforts to target this will have outsize effects on claims. Effective risk selection avoiding the most significant ransomware risk vectors, combined with vigilant monitoring for these controls, and proactive alerting are crucial strategies in preventing these attacks, thereby avoiding the substantial claims and financial losses they can incur.

Ben Duffy, KYND

## Ransomware

The number of ransomware incidents increased from 553 in 2019 to 749 in 2021. For 2022 and 2023, the incident counts stand at 277 and 244 so far, with additional incidents to be added to the total in the 2025 and 2026 Cyber Claims Reports.³ Ransom amounts and total incident cost have increased dramatically over the past five years.

The average cost of a ransomware incident decreased slightly in 2023 when compared to costs in 2020, 2021, and 2022. This is almost certainly due to the small number of ransomware claims collected for 2023 so far.

³ Each year, we collect data from the three previous years. For this report (2024) we collected claims for 2021-2023. We will continue to collect claims for incidents in 2023 for two more years.

BEC was the second leading cause of loss at SMEs. The number of BEC claims per year has been consistent over the past five years, ranging from 305 in 2022 to 393 in 2020. The 242 claims in 2023 are a result of limited data collection in 2024—this number will surely increase in next year’s report.

The cost of BEC incidents had been dropping until 2023, from a low of $91/92K in 2019-2020 to a high of $193K in 2023.

The consistency of the number of BEC claims impacting SMEs highlights the effectiveness of social engineering and the ongoing need for effective training and preventative measures. MFA cannot be viewed as a silver bullet. The implementation of preventative protocols and tools is a must.

Hackers were the third leading cause of loss at SMEs. Figure 36 below tells the good news: based on the five-year data, the average cost of a hacking
