## Executive Summary
Investing in crowdsourced security has become an imperative for organizations seeking to bolster their cybersecurity defenses. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberthreats, traditional security measures alone are often insufficient. Bug bounty engagements, among the most popular applications of crowdsourcing, offer a proactive approach by harnessing the collective expertise of ethical hackers in combination with rewards-based incentives. They provide an ongoing and cost-effective means of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, ultimately reducing the risk of data breaches and reputational damage.

Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty is a solution on the multipurpose Bugcrowd Platform that connects organizations with a global community of ethical hackers and security researchers and incentivizes them to identify vulnerabilities that traditional testing will generally miss. It provides a managed approach to bug bounty engagements, offering end-to-end support and expertise to help organizations run their bug bounty initiatives effectively. Bugcrowd’s Managed Bug Bounty solution helps organizations discover and address vulnerabilities, enhance their security posture, and reduce the risk of data breaches by leveraging the collective intelligence of trusted, skilled hackers in a controlled, scalable, and structured manner.

Bugcrowd commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) study and examine the potential return on investment (ROI) enterprises may realize by deploying Managed Bug Bounty.[^1] The purpose of this study is to provide readers with a framework to evaluate the potential financial impact of Managed Bug Bounty on their organizations.

**268%**

Net present value (NPV)  
**$1.43M**

To better understand the benefits, costs, and risks associated with this investment, Forrester interviewed four representatives with experience using Managed Bug Bounty and surveyed 39 decision-makers at the manager level or above who are responsible for security strategy, vulnerability management, or security operations at an organization that is leveraging ethical hacking engagements. For the purposes of this study, Forrester aggregated the interviewees’ and survey respondents’ experiences and combined the results into a single composite organization that generates $750 million in annual revenue and has 5,500 employees.

Interviewees said that before using Managed Bug Bounty, their organizations primarily relied on traditional penetration (pen) tests to identify exploitable vulnerabilities. Interviewees’ organizations also leveraged vulnerability management tools like vulnerability scanners, user-submitted vulnerability programs, or an alternative crowdsourced security provider. However, prior attempts yielded limited success, leaving them with limited expertise and security resources to effectively manage risk, costly traditional penetration test engagements, high noise from legacy solutions that created operational burdens, and limited continuous monitoring capabilities.

After the investment in Managed Bug Bounty, the interviewees noted their organizations leveraged a mixture of private and public and periodic and continuous bug bounty engagements to cover their applications. Public bug bounty programs are open to the general public and allow any interested individual to participate, while private bug bounty programs are invitation-only or restricted to a specific group of individuals. Key results from the investment include improved security operations efficiency, avoided traditional penetration test costs, material breach risk reduction savings, and reduced cybersecurity insurance premiums.

### KEY FINDINGS
**Quantified benefits.** Three-year, risk-adjusted present value (PV) quantified benefits for the composite organization include:
- **Improved security operations efficiency and avoided hiring two FTEs.** Bugcrowd’s Managed Bug Bounty engagement pairs the composite organization with experienced ethical hackers to identify high-confidence vulnerabilities that may have been missed by internal security teams and tools in the composite’s legacy environment. By providing actionable and triaged findings, Bugcrowd eliminates the need for manual triaging work, freeing up the time and resources of the composite’s internal security team. This improves coverage and reduces risk without the need to increase headcount. With the Managed Bug Bounty engagement in place, the composite reallocates existing security teams’ time to focus on remediating high-risk priorities and strategic tasks and avoids hiring additional internal security resources to gain the same level of coverage that Bugcrowd provides. The composite organization saves $819,000 in avoided hiring and overhead costs over three years.
- **Avoided 60% of traditional penetration test costs.** The composite organization leverages Bugcrowd to supplement and enhance its penetration testing efforts. Managed Bug Bounty engagements offer continuous, clear, and actionable insights into high-impact vulnerabilities within the composite’s environment, giving its security team a more comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities. As a result, the composite reduces the frequency and scope of traditional penetration tests, leading to $552,000 in cost savings over three years.
- **Reduced risk of a material breach by up to 30%.** The composite organization effectively reduces the risk of data breaches by leveraging Managed Bug Bounty engagements. With Bugcrowd, the composite increases its chances of identifying vulnerabilities that might have been overlooked in previous environments. The Managed Bug Bounty engagements also facilitate faster response times by incentivizing prompt reporting of vulnerabilities, leading to quicker fixes and minimizing the potential window of opportunity for malicious attackers. Furthermore, the continuous nature of the Managed Bug Bounty engagements provides a consistent mechanism for ongoing vulnerability identification and remediation, resulting in a gradual reduction of vulnerabilities within the composite organization’s systems over time. The composite organization avoids $528,000 of breach costs over three years.
- **Reduced cybersecurity insurance premium costs by 9%.** The Managed Bug Bounty engagement contributes to lower cyber insurance premium costs for the composite organization. This engagement demonstrates a proactive approach to security risk management, which signals to insurers that the composite is taking measures to mitigate potential cyberthreats. Insurers may view organizations with bug bounty engagements as having better security hygiene and reduced risk profile and are less likely to experience a data breach. As a result, insurers may offer lower premium costs as they perceive the composite to be a lower risk. The composite organization saves $57,000 of cyber insurance premium costs over three years.

**Unquantified benefits.** Benefits that provide value for the composite organization but are not quantified for this study include:
- **Shorter time to remediation.** Managed Bug Bounty engagements lead to shorter vulnerability remediation times for the composite than alternative solutions.
- **Improved relationship between developers and security due to better communication.** Managed Bug Bounty bridges communication gaps between security and developer teams, allowing for more robust security processes.
- **Improved reputation and demonstration of security maturity.** Bugcrowd demonstrates security maturity, bolstering brand and reputation from the vantage point of customers, partners, auditors, and other third-party stakeholders.
- **Improved compliance reporting.** Bugcrowd demonstrates security posture health to regulators and speeds up reporting processes.
- **Effective researcher pairing and strong vendor support.** Managed Bug Bounty provides high-quality and effective researchers, AI algorithms, and required data for sourcing and activating specific skill sets, program management, and overall vendor support. This results in higher accuracy, fewer false positives, and more edge cases identified for the composite organization.
- **Flexibility to adapt to changing threat environments without new hires or onboarding new tools.** Managed Bug Bounty engagements give access to scalable and diverse talent to provide cost-effective and timely response to new threats and security standards. This addition to security risk management engagements allows the composite to forgo onboarding of additional new hires and tools.

**Costs.** Three-year, risk-adjusted PV costs for the composite organization include:
- **Platform and reward pool costs of $522,000 over three years.** Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty consists of a platform fee and payments in a rewards pool that are reserved to incentivize and payout to researchers. Platform fees and reward pools vary depending on sizing and requirements. Contact Bugcrowd for additional details.
- **Implementation and change management costs of less than $9,000.** Forrester accounts for upfront internal labor hours dedicated to implementation and change management.

The financial analysis which is based on the interviews and survey found that a composite organization experiences benefits of $1.96 million over three years versus costs of $531,000, adding up to a net present value (NPV) of $1.43 million and an ROI of 268%.

## The Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty Customer Journey
### Drivers leading to the Managed Bug Bounty investment
#### KEY CHALLENGES
Forrester interviewed four representatives with experience using Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty at their organization and surveyed 39 respondents with experience using a crowdsourced security vendor, 54% of whom had experience using Bugcrowd. Our survey found that 69% of respondents noted their organization used private engagements across an average of 543 assets. For more details on the interviewees and survey respondents, see Appendix B.

Before Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty, interviewees and survey respondents noted their organizations primarily relied on traditional penetration tests to identify exploitable vulnerabilities. Interviewees’ organizations also leveraged vulnerability management tools like vulnerability scanners, self-managed vulnerability disclosure programs, or an alternative crowdsourced security provider.

The interviewees noted how their organizations struggled with common challenges, including:
- **Limited expertise and security resources.** Interviewees told Forrester their organizations lacked the security knowledge and resources to identify, triage, and address vulnerabilities. Existing security personnel were already fully utilized with the existing volume of vulnerabilities to address, and hiring additional resources was cost-prohibitive.
- **Traditional penetration test engagements were costly and yielded limited success.** Interviewees told Forrester that traditional penetration tests were expensive, particularly for smaller organizations with limited budgets. Planning, executing, and managing results from traditional penetration test engagements was time-consuming. The quality between providers varied, and assessments missed or failed to prioritize exploitable vulnerabilities. Finally, interviewees struggled to retest and verify fixes in their environments until the next engagement after remediating issues. The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive organization said: “Prior to [Managed Bug Bounty], we had paid testing engagements with third-party vendors. As you can imagine, that’s expensive, and you pay for a tester’s time instead of per finding.”
- The head of information security at a healthcare organization stated: “It takes a long time to do an annual pen test and you might not have a checkpoint between those 365 days to see how you’re progressing from an external attacker perspective. You might have an internal security team monitoring application security or internal SaaS [software-as-a-service] tools, but there’s no substitute for having talented researchers assess your infrastructure from an external perspective.”
- **High noise from legacy solutions created an operational burden.** Interviewees stated that legacy vendor tools, traditional penetration tests, user submissions, and legacy crowdsourced security solutions generated false positives, duplicates, and other noise, creating additional triaging work for already resource-constrained security teams. The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive organization said: “There was a high amount of noise from [our legacy crowdsourced security partner]. It takes someone who is paid well to sit there, sort out findings, and respond to the researcher. It’s a back-and-forth, they complain, and you have to go through it. None of that is our burden with Bugcrowd. Bugcrowd effectively manages the community regarding expectations and gives customers guidance on how to respond and engage with them.”
- **Incomplete coverage and lack of continuous monitoring.** Before Bugcrowd, interviewees’ organizations lacked continuous, red-teaming coverage across their systems, platforms, and technologies, leaving them susceptible to attacks. The head of information security at a healthcare organization stated: “[Before Bugcrowd,] vulnerabilities were not being found because humans are much more creative in finding vulnerabilities than automated systems are. Those vulnerabilities would go undiscovered for long periods without Managed Bug Bounty.”

### WHY BUGCROWD MANAGED BUG BOUNTY?
Interviewees and survey respondents noted their organizations required a cost-effective solution to identify and triage vulnerabilities, lower risk, and harden security posture. The interviewees’ organizations searched for a solution that could:
- **Leverage expert hackers to keep pace with a quickly evolving threat landscape and to help identify high-risk vulnerabilities.** The head of information security at a healthcare organization said: “The [cybersecurity] field and types of vulnerabilities and hacking emerging is moving super fast. It’s important to have intelligent researchers who are tapped into everything that’s going on in that sense and are up to date on the latest vulnerabilities, techniques, and procedures. That’s one of the most important pieces of using a crowdsourced bug bounty.”
- The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive organization said: “Because Bugcrowd is community-based, we benefit from many different perspectives. That’s an intrinsic component of the platform itself. Even though we continue to partner with a single vendor, we benefit from the fresh perspective of many different researchers as an individual.”
- **Augment traditional penetration tests and vulnerability scanners to increase coverage and insights and reduce cost.** The head of information security at a healthcare organization said: “One of the key things you don’t have without a bug bounty engagement is the ongoing support and monitoring from an external perspective and from humans specifically, not just automated tools.”
- **Improve operational efficiency with support from the Managed Bug Bounty team.** The senior manager of application security at a technology organization stated: “We are still growing our security maturity. Bugcrowd makes sense because we can get much greater coverage of our environment and systems. It’s more efficient.”
- The same interviewee stated: “The Bugcrowd Platform has been pretty successful in helping our engineers and application owners understand the impact of vulnerabilities and how they manifest themselves in the outside world. It takes things from the theoretical, where we find the potential vulnerabilities in SaaS tools and things like that and makes them more real. It’s been a good partnership.”

After a request for proposal (RFP) and business case process evaluating multiple vendors, the interviewees’ organizations chose Managed Bug Bounty and began deployment:
- Interviewees leveraged Managed Bug Bounty to cover external services and customer-facing applications.
- Interviewees ran either continuous or periodic bug bounty engagements.
- All interviewees ran private engagements; one interviewee combined public and private ones.

> “Our partnership with Bugcrowd has been invaluable. Instead of paying per hour, you pay per actionable finding. That is a major differentiator because security expertise is not cheap and can take many hours.”

#### COMPOSITE ORGANIZATION
Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester constructed a TEI framework, a composite company, and an ROI analysis that illustrates the areas financially affected. The composite organization is representative of the four interviewees and 39 respondents, and it is used to present the aggregate financial analysis in the next section. The composite organization has the following characteristics:

**Description of composite.** The composite organization is a United States-based company that generates $750 million in annual revenue and employs 5,500 employees. On the security side, the composite employs four security operations (SecOps) FTEs who are responsible for all vulnerability management engagements, including Managed Bug Bounty. The composite leverages external traditional penetration tests to find vulnerabilities.

**Deployment characteristics.** The composite invests in a Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty engagement with Bugcrowd to augment traditional penetration tests and expand its vulnerability management maturity. The composite begins with continuous, private bug bounty engagements across its customer-facing assets. As it runs and manages engagements proficiently, the composite expands to public bug bounty engagements. The Managed Bug Bounty engagement includes 500 assets in scope.

### SECURITY OPERATIONS EFFICIENCY
**Evidence and data.** According to interviewees, Bugcrowd’s Managed Bug Bounty solution effectively paired experienced, ethical hackers with organizations to identify high-confidence vulnerabilities that internal security teams and tools may have missed. By providing actionable and triaged findings, Bugcrowd eliminated the need for manual triaging work, freeing up the time and resources of internal security teams. With the Managed Bug Bounty engagement in place, interviewees’ organizations could reallocate their existing security teams’ time to focus on strategic initiatives and avoid hiring additional internal security resources to gain the same coverage that Bugcrowd provides. This resulted in improved coverage and reduced risk. Interviewees and survey respondent provided the following evidence:
- The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive organization said: “It’s much cheaper to pay Bugcrowd engineers than if we were to open a position for an FTE to satisfy that same requirement. The value proposition is incredible on multiple fronts. We have our internal engineers focusing on things that deliver higher ROI and not just waiting for report submissions. Then Bugcrowd handles the triage, and we only pay researchers when they provide actionable findings. We’re not paying them per hour, regardless of their findings. They are strongly incentivized to have meaningful submissions.” The same interviewee said, “I would need a staff of at least 15 FTEs, probably costing $200,000 to $250,000 each, to have the same level of engagement and testing that Bugcrowd provides.”
- The senior manager of application security at a technology organization stated, “By outsourcing to Managed Bug Bounty, my internal resources can focus on remediation and helping the internal teams fix things rather than just looking and sifting through all the submissions looking for the good ones.” The same interviewee estimated: “If we didn’t have [Bugcrowd’s] Bug Bounty program, we’d have to hire more internal penetration testing resources to replicate that coverage. We would probably have to hire at least three folks to get to any accepted level of coverage.”
- The head of information security at a healthcare organization stated: “Given that we don’t have a dedicated internal application security team, [Bugcrowd] has helped insofar as we don’t have to have full-time employees that are charged with this task, and we can rely on the more cost-effective approach to testing. A seasoned security engineer can cost around $150,000 per year. To have the same level of support [as we do with Bugcrowd], we’d need a couple of them.”
- Our survey found that 21 out of 25 survey respondents were able to reassign/save at least two FTEs as a result of their organization’s crowdsourced security engagements.

> “The benefit we get from leveraging the external research community is we have folks in that community who have deep expertise in various areas. Each of them can focus on and look for the types of issues that they’re most efficient at finding. It makes the overall vulnerability identification piece more cost effective for us than trying to cover that with internal resources, given that we’re a small team.”
>
> SENIOR MANAGER OF APPLICATION SECURITY, TECHNOLOGY

**Modeling and assumptions.** Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester assumes the following about the composite organization:
- The composite organization dedicates four security operations FTEs who oversee vulnerability management, including the Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty engagement.
- The composite organization requires a 50% increase in SecOps staff for triaging and to provide vulnerability remediation guidance without Bugcrowd.
- The annual fully burdened rate for a SecOps FTE is $130,950, including a 1.35 fully burdened multiplier.
- The hiring cost for a SecOps FTE is calculated by multiplying the fully burdened rate with a 131% hiring cost multiplier.

**Risks.** Forrester recognizes that these results may not be representative of all experiences. The impact of this benefit will vary depending on:
- Security operations and vulnerability management maturity.
- SecOps fully burdened rate.
- SecOps hiring costs.

**Results.** To account for these risks, Forrester adjusted this benefit downward by 15%, yielding a three-year, risk-adjusted total PV (discounted at 10%) of $819,000.

### AVOIDED TRADITIONAL PENETRATION TEST COSTS
**Evidence and data.** Interviewees noted their organizations found traditional penetration tests expensive, resource-intensive, and unable to verify fixes promptly. To address these limitations, interviewees turned to Bugcrowd to supplement and enhance their penetration testing efforts. They quickly realized that the Managed Bug Bounty engagements offered continuous, clear, and actionable insights into high-impact vulnerabilities within their environment. By leveraging Bugcrowd’s insights, interviewees’ organizations gained a more efficient and cost-effective approach to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in their systems. As a result, the interviewees’ organizations reduced the frequency or scope of traditional penetration tests, leading to significant cost savings. Interviewees and survey respondents provided the following evidence:
- The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive organization said, “For less than $100,000, we had more findings in 60 days when we had over multiple years of paid [traditional penetration test] engagements at an order of magnitude higher cost.” The senior director continued: “We have largely replaced most of our third-party pen testing spend with Bugcrowd. … We saved $350,000 by changing our approach to application security testing by third parties. Instead of engaging a vendor on an ad hoc basis every year, we have a continuous bounty program that operates 24/7, 365 days a year, with the same results.”
- Nine out of 15 survey respondents said their organization saved between $250,000 to $749,000 by reducing or replacing pen testing or other security solutions or processes. This averages out to $320,000.

**Modeling and assumptions.** Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester assumes the following about the composite organization:
- The composite analysis paid $500,000 to conduct traditional penetration tests in the legacy environment.
- The composite organization augments its traditional penetration testing with Managed Bug Bounty. After doing so, the composite reduces 40% of traditional pen test usage and costs in Year 1, 50% in Year 2, and 60% in Year 3 as the organization‘s proficiency and efficacy with Managed Bug Bounty engagements matures.
- This results in $200,000 of cost savings in Year 1, $250,000 in Year 2, and $300,000 in Year 3.

**Risks.** Forrester recognizes that these results may not be representative of all experiences. The impact of this benefit will vary depending on:
- Security and vulnerability management maturity.
- Frequency, scope, and cost of traditional penetration tests.
- Compliance requirements.

**Results.** To account for these risks, Forrester adjusted this benefit downward by 10%, yielding a three-year, risk-adjusted total PV (discounted at 10%) of $552,000.

### MATERIAL BREACH RISK REDUCTION SAVINGS
**Evidence and data.** Interviewees told Forrester that Managed Bug Bounty engagements effectively reduced the risk of data breaches. By engaging ethical hackers and security researchers, interviewees’ organizations increased their chances of identifying vulnerabilities that might have been overlooked in previous environments. The Managed Bug Bounty engagements also facilitated faster response times by incentivizing prompt reporting of vulnerabilities, leading to quicker fixes and minimizing the potential window of opportunity for malicious attackers. Furthermore, the continuous nature of these Managed Bug Bounty engagements provided a consistent mechanism for ongoing vulnerability identification and remediation, resulting in a gradual reduction of vulnerabilities within the interviewees’ organizations’ systems over time. Interviewees and survey respondents provided the following evidence:
- The senior manager of application security noted their technology organization reduced the number of critical vulnerabilities by 60% with Managed Bug Bounty. The interviewee told Forrester: “We’re improving the overall security posture via the Managed Bug Bounty program because we know we’re finding out about vulnerabilities faster, closing them faster, and shortening the exposure window. That’s the main way we demonstrate the value here.”
- The head of information security at a healthcare organization said: “There have been discoveries from the Managed Bug Bounty program that were related to data leakage and therefore were avoided, which could have potentially led to undesired disclosure of information. It was a very important finding. … [Bugcrowd] has substantially lowered the risk of a breach.”
- The senior director of information security at an automotive organization explained: “Bugcrowd is now probably 10% of our overall application security findings. But in the program’s first year, it was easily 95%. Most of our findings for the program’s first year were attributed to Bugcrowd because the body of researchers that we had engaged were providing a lot of really clever and novel threat techniques that effectively found gaps in our security posture.”
- Sixteen out of 24 respondents who reduced priority 1 (P1) or critical vulnerabilities, incidents, or security breaches had found two or more critical or P1 vulnerabilities per month with their organization’s crowdsourced security engagements.
- Twenty-four respondents were able to reduce the likelihood of security breach, on average, by 33% with their organization’s crowdsourced security engagements.
- Fourteen out of 24 respondents  who reduced priority 1 (P1) or critical vulnerabilities, incidents, or security breaches estimated that the average financial impact from a P1 was $250,000.

> “The quality of the findings is very high because Bugcrowd researchers give very detailed instructions on how to duplicate the vulnerability and how to assess it. Then you also have the benefit of having them being able to retest the vulnerabilities after they’ve been fixed to make sure that they’ve been remediated. They’re typically also very easy to collaborate and work with via the platform.”

> HEAD OF INFORMATION SECURITY, HEALTHCARE

**Modeling and assumptions.** Based on the interviews and survey, Forrester assumes the following about the composite organization:
- The composite organization is susceptible to 4.7 material data breaches on average, per year.[^2]
- Nearly half (49.1%) of the data breaches originate from external attacks.[^3]
- The average cost of each breach is $466,000, which may include response and remediation costs, efforts to notify affected parties, regulatory fines, customer lawsuits, downtime, and more.[^4]
- By utilizing Bugcrowd Managed Bug Bounty engagements, the composite organization reduces the likelihood of a material security breach by 20% in Year 1, 25% in Year 2, and 30% in Year 3. The reduction in likelihood increases year over year as the composite organization’s proficiency and efficacy with Managed Bug Bounty engagements matures.

**Risks.** Forrester recognizes that these results may not be representative of all experiences. The impact of this benefit will vary depending on:
- Security and vulnerability management maturity.
- Organization size and industry.
- Frequency and severity of data breaches.
- Data breach size and costs.

**Results.** To account for these risks, Forrester adjusted this benefit downward by 20%, yielding a three-year, risk-adjusted total PV (discounted at 10%) of $528,000.

### REDUCED CYBERSECURITY INSURANCE PREMIUM COSTS
**Evidence and data.** Interviewees told Forrester that having Managed Bug Bounty engagements contributed to lower cyber insurance premium costs. By actively engaging ethical hackers and security researchers to identify vulnerabilities in their systems, the interviewees’ organizations demonstrated a proactive approach to security risk management. Interviewees noted that this proactive stance signaled to insurers that their organizations were taking measures to mitigate potential cyberthreats. Because of this, insurers viewed the interviewees’ organizations with bug bounty engagements as having better security hygiene and reduced risk profile and were less likely to experience a data breach. As a result, insurers may offer lower premium costs as they perceived the interviewees’ organization to be a lower risk. Interviewees stated that the reduced likelihood and potential impact of a data breach and lower risk profile further contributed to reduced insurance premiums. Interviewees and survey respondents provided the following evidence:
- The senior director of information security and IT at an automotive company told Forrester: “We’ve had a significant increase in our security posture, and we’ve been able to recognize substantial savings on our cybersecurity assurance premiums as a result of not only Bugcrowd but all the other good work that we’ve done
