## FOREWORD BY INTERPOL

In today's world, technology is not just a convenience; it is a foundation of our daily lives. The Internet, a cornerstone of this technological era, is vital for managing critical infrastructures, executing secure financial transactions, maintaining connections with loved ones, indulging in online shopping, and accessing a wealth of information and entertainment. Its ability to bridge vast distances and facilitate immediate access to data and virtual experiences has made it indispensable for all of us.

However, the digital age comes with its own set of challenges, mainly, the escalating threat of cybercrime. As technology advances, so do the tactics used by cybercriminals, who employ increasingly sophisticated methods to exploit vulnerabilities, posing a significant risk to individuals and organizations alike. Victims are often left financially, psychologically, and emotionally destitute. At the same time, the threat landscape is exacerbated by broader social, economic, and political developments, including the growing inequality between those countries, organizations, and individuals that are cyber resilient and those that are not. All these circumstances are exploited by cybercriminals at a national, regional, and global level, leaving behind an endless list of victims.

As we step into 2024, the importance of implementing comprehensive cybersecurity strategies cannot be overstated. Both large and small entities must safeguard themselves against a wide range of cyber threats, from conventional attacks to emerging, more sophisticated dangers.

For the last nine years, INTERPOL has been leading a cohesive and coherent international cybercrime programme, underpinned by its Global Cybercrime Strategy which aims to reduce the global impact of cybercrime and protect communities for a safer world. INTERPOL coordinates and supports its 196 member countries through activities which prevent, detect, investigate, and disrupt cybercrimes that cause high levels of harm and have a high impact, or that are very frequent or of high interest within the communities we help protect. This is implemented via a three-sided framework that provides support to member countries in the areas of information sharing, operational coordination, and strategic and capabilities development.

Within this context, INTERPOL has introduced a regional approach that offers tailored support through the Regional Cybercrime Operations Desks. The Africa Joint Cybercrime Operations Desk (AFJOC), funded by the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, is an example of this initiative. It specializes in gathering and analysing information on cybercriminal activity, carrying out intelligence-led coordinated law enforcement action, and overall promoting cooperation and best practices amongst African member countries, as well as partnerships with both public and private stakeholders.

With this in mind, I am privileged to introduce the latest edition of the African Cyberthreat Assessment Report. This assessment provides a comprehensive analysis of the cyberthreat landscape in the African continent, specifically examining ransomware, business email compromise, and other forms of online scams. It goes beyond merely highlighting these cyber threats, but also examines continued national efforts to improve cyber resilience. The report concludes with strategic recommendations to pave the way forward.

Throughout the analysis, the critical need for international and regional cooperation among law enforcement agencies in the face of cybercriminal activities is shown to be incontestable. A unified approach enhances the ability to address threats effectively, allowing for intelligence exchange, sharing investigative practices, and making use of advanced technologies.

Policing will always need to be delivered locally and will always be an integral part of our communities. However, crimes such as cybercrime have a global footprint and involve a volume, scale and complexity that can be challenging for all. We have a collective responsibility to prevent, detect, investigate, and disrupt the criminals and groups behind these crimes. Whether individuals or business connecting to the Internet, we need to be safer.

In this complex landscape, no single actor alone can enable us to ensure our collective safety. Acknowledging this, INTERPOL serves as a neutral and trusted interlocutor, fostering collaboration between law enforcement and the public and private sectors. By combining efforts and sharing expertise, INTERPOL aims to strengthen our collective defences against cyber threats, emphasizing the responsibility we share to secure our digital world.

In conclusion, I would like to extend my gratitude to our member countries in the African region and to our partners, for their unwavering support and dedication to this cause and their contribution to producing this assessment. Their relentless effort and commitment are key to advancing our shared goal of a safer digital environment for all.

## FOREWORD BY AFRIPOL

As we reflect on the past year and look towards the future, the landscape of cyber threats in Africa, and indeed globally, continues to evolve, becoming increasingly complex. The journey from the late 1990s, where Internet access in Africa was a luxury few could afford, to today, where we are witnessing a surge in connectivity, illustrates the remarkable trajectory of technological advancement. This journey, however, is not without its challenges. The proliferation of cyber threats has escalated, reaching every corner of our continent and affecting individuals, governments, and industry alike.

The year 2023 has been pivotal in shaping our response to these emerging threats. Building on the foundations laid in previous years, the battle against cybercrime has made significant progress. Our collaboration with INTERPOL has never been stronger, and is marked by innovative initiatives and the deployment of advanced technologies aimed at fortifying our cyber defences. The establishment of the AFRIPOL data centre and forensic databases, and the inauguration of the Criminal Intelligence Analysis Unit (CIA), are critical milestones in our journey towards a safer cyber environment in Africa.

The launch of the AFRIPOL Bootcamp on Cybercrime investigation is testament to our commitment to capacity building on the continent. The expansion of these programmes to include advanced modules on cybersecurity threats and response strategies has enriched the arsenal we can use against cybercriminals. The engagement from member states has been overwhelmingly positive, with participation numbers soaring and a marked improvement in the skillsets of our cybersecurity personnel.

In 2023, our partnerships have flourished, extending beyond our traditional allies to include tech giants and academic institutions. These collaborations have enabled us to tap into cutting-edge research and technology, thus enhancing our adaptability to the ever-changing cyber landscape. Our focus has also expanded to address the socioeconomic impact of cyber threats, in the knowledge that cybersecurity is not just a technical challenge but a cornerstone of our economic stability and growth. Africa has a burgeoning digital economy, and protecting this vital sector is paramount for our sustainable development.

Looking ahead to 2024, AFRIPOL is committed to multiplying our efforts on four strategic fronts:

1. Recognizing the borderless nature of cyber threats, we aim to strengthen our network of cooperation across the continent and with our global partners. This includes sharing intelligence, joint operations, and harmonizing legal frameworks to ensure a unified front against cybercrime. We are also strengthening collaboration with the private sector in order to harmonize and standardize procedures and technologies, and to enable intelligence-gathering across the continent.

At the start of 2024, AFRIPOL signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Group IB, a global leader in cybersecurity. This partnership will enhance intelligence sharing and equip the African union member states with cutting-edge technology and specialized knowledge in critical areas such as cyber investigations, reverse engineering, and incident management. By leveraging these advanced tools and expertise, AFRIPOL will bolster its capabilities in safeguarding against cyber threats on the continent. Moreover, AFRIPOL is due to sign an agreement with Kaspersky, a strategic private partner.

2. A key element of our strategy involves forming a task force for sharing information on cybercrime incidents and providing the necessary investigative support. We are dedicated to supplying essential hardware and software for cybercrime investigations to our member states, along with specialized training on these tools. Some examples of our initiatives are the INTERPOL-AFRIPOL 3rd Joint Cybercrime Operation, known as Africa Cyber Surge 3, our specialized training on virtual assets, and the provision of crucial investigation tools jointly with INTERPOL, all of which underscore our unwavering commitment to bolstering our cyber defence capabilities across the continent.

3. We will continue to explore and integrate emerging technology such as artificial intelligence and blockchain in order to enhance our cyber defence capabilities. These technologies offer promising avenues for predictive threat analysis, secure data management, and efficient resource allocation. Furthermore, we are embracing open-source technologies through our training programs, which shows our commitment to overcoming the financial challenges associated with costly licensing fees.

4. We have an increased focus on community engagement, and plan to launch comprehensive cyber-awareness campaigns targeting vulnerable populations, including young people and SMEs. Educating these key demographics on cyber hygiene practices is a critical element in mitigating the risk of cyber threats at a grassroots level.

The path ahead is fraught with challenges, but our resolve remains unshaken. As we forge ahead into 2024, we have a clear vision: to create a secure, resilient digital Africa where technology serves as a beacon of progress, not a vector of vulnerability. Together, with the unwavering support of our partners and the collective efforts of our member states, we are poised to make this vision a reality. Let us embrace this journey with determination and optimism, as the security of our cyberspace is the cornerstone of our shared prosperity.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents INTERPOL’s analysis of the main cyber threats affecting the African continent, drawing on internal intelligence, operational insights, survey results, and contributions from private sector partners.

The key findings of the report underscore the continent-wide escalation of cybercrime, with ransomware, business email compromise, and other forms of online scams emerging as the most rapidly expanding threats in 2023. Ransomware in particular was identified as a critical emerging threat which frequently targets essential infrastructure, while online scams remain the most common form of digital crime against individuals and companies, with significant volume and financial implications. The report also notes the rapid evolution of threat actors and their modus operandi, including the growing exploitation of social media, the use of artificial intelligence, and advanced social engineering techniques.

The document sheds light on African national efforts in addressing cybercrime, focusing on legislative development, the enhancement of law enforcement capabilities, fostering partnerships, and public engagement. While member countries have taken important steps to strengthen their cyber defences and improve law enforcement responses, there is still a range of hurdles to achieving a comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable approach to countering cybercrime across the continent.

INTERPOL’s commitment to Africa in terms of fighting cybercrime, as well as the assistance it provides in this area, can be seen throughout the report. This is primarily carried out through a specialized regional approach led by the INTERPOL Africa Cybercrime Operations Desk and implemented via the “Africa Joint Operation Against Cybercrime” project, which is funded by the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. This initiative is complemented by other significant activities, included those delivered by the INTERPOL Support Programme for the African Union and the Global Action on Cybercrime Extended.

The report concludes with strategic recommendations from INTERPOL on how to navigate the African cyber threat landscape and strengthen cybersecurity across the continent. Recommendations include adopting or improving comprehensive and unified cybersecurity measures, investing in law enforcement cyber capacities (people, processes, and technology), creating synergies within the cybersecurity ecosystem, raising public awareness, and strengthening international and regional cooperation.

# 1 Introduction

African countries are experiencing a remarkable digital transformation. Despite ongoing challenges in infrastructure coverage, access, and quality, the number of Internet users continues to increase across the continent, with over 160 million individuals regularly accessing cyberspace between 2019 and 2022.¹ The impact of digitalization is clear to see across numerous sectors, ranging from critical infrastructure to banking and e-commerce. It is also permeating many aspects of African citizens’ daily lives, from the rapidly rising number of digital payments to the increasing amount of time spent online, especially on social media platforms. On an individual level, growing access to the Internet is facilitated in particular by the widespread adoption of mobile phones, with over 650 million Africans using these devices as their primary means of accessing the Internet.

This digital revolution is having a particular impact on Africa’s young people, who represent over 60 per cent of the continent’s population.² Many are increasingly turning to the Internet, often via mobile phones, to communicate, work, transfer money, shop, and express their creativity. As young Africans rapidly adopt digital technologies, they are contributing to the development of a youthful, cyber-driven society. This presents countries with incredible opportunities for continued growth and innovation, but also emerging cyber security challenges and vulnerabilities.

The rising number of Africans who are going online, economies’ and societies’ growing reliance on technology, and the advent of so-called “digital natives” are inevitably broadening the cyber-attack surface for criminals. As a result, cybercrime is surging across Africa, and is one of the fastest emerging threats across the continent. The first INTERPOL Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report (2021) estimated the financial impact of cybercrime in the region to be more than USD 4 billion, which is about 10 per cent of Africa’s total gross domestic product.³ Since then, the challenge confronting INTERPOL’s 54 African member countries has only grown in volume, impact, and complexity.

Addressing poor digital literacy, inadequate cyber preparedness, and a general lack of good cyber hygiene practices is becoming increasingly urgent. Fortunately, African countries have taken important steps in 2023 to build more secure digital economies and protect their communities online. INTERPOL is committed to supporting its member countries in fulfilling these objectives. Recognizing the incredible diversity of the African continent, including its vast array of cultures, languages, and economic conditions, key projects and programmes such as the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime (AFJOC) and the INTERPOL Support Programme for the African Union (ISPA) deliver critical activities tailored to the needs of the various African national law enforcement agencies.

# 2 Overview of trends in the African Cyber threat landscape: 2023

Threat actors and their modus operandi are evolving rapidly – from more sophisticated social engineering techniques to the increasing use of social media and artificial intelligence

*   Cybercriminals operating both in and from Africa continue to exploit human vulnerabilities as a main method of attack. They are deploying increasingly sophisticated social engineering techniques to target organizations and individuals.
*   Email phishing remains one of the primary initial attack vectors across a variety of cybercrimes, including ransomware and many forms of online scams. In addition, criminals are progressively exploiting different communication channels, including social media and instant messaging apps, in line with regional technological and societal trends.
*   Perpetrators are integrating technological advances into their modus operandi. Prominent examples include the growing use of data theft as a form of extortion, as well as the rising misuse of artificial intelligence.

In 2023, the African cyber threat landscape remained highly dynamic, with attacks evolving rapidly in sophistication and scale. Based on intelligence and operational data from INTERPOL’s regional activities, complemented with the results of a questionnaire distributed to African member countries and information from private sector partners, INTERPOL has identified the following key threats and trends:

The volume and impact of cybercrimes continue to surge across Africa

*   The number of cybercrime attacks continues to rise across the African continent, as highlighted by INTERPOL member countries.⁴
*   Over two thirds of respondents assessed cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes as being medium to high risks in their jurisdiction. In particular, countries indicated an increase in the financial and social impact of these crimes.
*   In a further illustration of the rapid growth of cybercrime, it is estimated that in 2023, there was a 23 per cent year-on-year increase in the average number of weekly cyberattacks per organization in Africa. This average was the highest in the world.⁵

Ransomware, business email compromise, and other online scams were the fastest growing cyber threats in 2023

*   Previous editions of the INTERPOL African Cyberthreat Assessment Report identified the following most prominent cyberthreats: malware attacks, including ransomware, banking trojans and stealers; phishing and online scams, such as business email compromise (BEC); and crimeware-as-a-service, such as spyware and phishing kits. These threats continue to have an impact on the African cyber landscape, causing significant harm to communities across the continent.
*   In 2023, the top cyber threats identified by African member countries were ransomware, BEC, and other online scams.
*   Ransomware was highlighted as one of the most serious emerging threats on the continent, often targeting critical infrastructure, while online scams are still the main form of digital crime affecting individuals and organizations, in terms of volume and financial impact.

In response to the escalating threat posed by cybercrimes, African member countries have taken important steps to enhance cyber resilience and law enforcement capabilities

However, significant investigative challenges remain in terms of effectively preventing, detecting, investigating and disrupting cybercrime across Africa

*   There was an increase in arrests, actions, and investigations, aided by the expansion of anti-cybercrime resources. For instance, 19 member countries highlighted a cumulative total of 10,490 arrests related to cybercrime from January to December 2023. Considering that these countries represent only 35 per cent of the continent, the total number of cybercrime arrests is likely to be much higher.
*   Over the last two years, a dozen African countries have adopted or have engaged in the process of adopting new cybercrime-related legislation. This marks a proactive stride towards strengthening legal frameworks to combat cybercrime.
*   There was also substantial growth in investment in countering cybercrime on the continent, including from African member countries and stakeholders outside the region. In 2023, more countries established dedicated cybercrime units, nearly half increased staffing levels, and over 60 per cent reported being involved in capacity-building initiatives. Furthermore, there were over 130 training initiatives, as well as more than 40 public awareness campaigns on the continent.
*   The continued underreporting of cybercrimes hinders law enforcement’s ability to act. In some countries, this challenge is aggravated by the absence of specific or easy-to-use reporting and recording platforms.
*   Despite some progress, collaboration between law enforcement and other key stakeholders – including the private sector and cybersecurity agencies – remains a challenge in some jurisdictions.
*   Insufficient cyber hygiene continues to undermine cyber resilience across the continent, as many African organizations and individuals still show low levels of preparedness against cyberattacks.

The following sections provide an in-depth analysis of the trends in the top cyber threats identified by INTERPOL’s member countries in Africa: ransomware, online scams and business email compromise.

⁴ This information is based on self-reporting by African member countries. It should be noted that definitions of cybercrime may vary across jurisdictions.

# 3 Ransomware and digital extortion

Key Points:

*   Ransomware and digital extortion are on the rise, with over half of INTERPOL’s African member countries reporting attacks against their critical infrastructure.
*   Phishing emails remain the most common attack vector for ransomware attacks in Africa, while the extortion methods and business models used by cybercriminals are evolving.
*   Overall, African member countries have taken positive steps to enhance their resilience to ransomware attacks, but persistent challenges remain, notably in terms of the reporting of attacks and the payment of ransoms.

Ransomware and digital extortion on the rise in Africa

Ransomware and digital extortion were identified by INTERPOL member countries as one of the most serious cyberthreats faced by the African continent. Such attacks are of particular concern due to their high financial impact, their ability to severely disrupt critical infrastructure and essential services, and the harm they can cause to the organizations and individuals affected. The scale of the challenge is clear: according to cyber security company Chainalysis, ransomware payments exceeded USD 1 billion globally in 2023.⁶

The volume, frequency, and impact of ransomware attacks continues to grow in Africa. Research from cyber security firm Check Point suggests that on average, 1 out of every 15 organizations in Africa experienced a ransomware attempt every week during the first quarter of 2023. This is even higher than the global weekly average, which stood at about 1 in every 31 organizations.⁷ During a single week in February 2023, INTERPOL private partner Kaspersky reportedly detected over 300 cases of ransomware attempts in South Africa, which illustrates the increasing frequency of attacks.⁸ The financial impact of attacks also appears to be on the rise: according to IBM, the average cost of a ransomware attack in 2023 was USD 5.13 million, which is a 13 per cent increase on 2022.⁹

African critical infrastructure under attack

Worryingly, nearly half of the African countries surveyed reported ransomware attacks against their critical infrastructure between January 2023 and December 2023. This includes attacks targeting government infrastructure, hospitals, financial institutions, and Internet service providers. To give a few examples, in recent years Ghana’s largest electricity seller, the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), the national banks of Zambia and South Sudan, government institutions in Ethiopia, Senegal and Zimbabwe, and South African Internet service provider RSAWEB have all been subjected to ransomware attacks. Even the African Union faced a crippling attack from the BlackCat group (also known as ALPHV) against its internal network in 2023, which INTERPOL and its partners were able to mitigate.¹⁰ The targeting of critical infrastructure is particularly alarming, as digital transformation continues to accelerate across the continent and essential systems become increasingly connected.

Besides critical infrastructure, African member countries also reported ransomware attacks across various sectors. This includes a significant number of attacks against businesses across sectors such as finance, manufacturing, and retail. For instance, according to IT security company Sophos, 78 per cent of companies in South Africa suffered ransomware attacks in 2023.¹¹ Some examples of high-profile attacks include those against Porsche South Africa’s Johannesburg headquarters, and the South African division of international credit bureau TransUnion. These trends are in line with global developments. According to aggregated data provided by INTERPOL private sector partners, while banking, government, retail, and the technology and healthcare sectors were the most targeted globally, no sector, institution, or organization is immune to ransomware attacks.

Persistent exploitation of the human element

Evolving tactics for digital extortion

In terms of modus operandi, phishing emails appear to be the most common delivery vector for ransomware attacks in Africa, with about half of INTERPOL’s African member countries reporting instances of phishing during such attacks. These emails typically contain a malicious file or URL, designed to facilitate access to a system by a threat actor or to immediately deploy malware when clicked on. Other common infection methods used by ransomware groups in the African region include the exploitation of unsecured remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections and other vulnerabilities. These regional trends are consistent with the global findings of INTERPOL private partner Trend Micro.¹² According to the cyber security firm, the most common initial attack vectors used by ransomware groups worldwide are email, web and web applications, malicious software such as fake mobile apps, and the exploitation of system vulnerabilities such as unsecured RDP connections.

Understanding how threat actors gain initial access in order to deploy ransomware is paramount to improving prevention, detection and mitigation efforts. Notably, most of the attack vectors exploit the human element, whether it is a user clicking on a malicious URL or an IT administrator failing to regularly update or patch their systems. In fact, research from cyber security firm Fortinet, an INTERPOL Gateway partner, indicates that many ransomware groups are spending more time selecting and researching their targets.¹³ They leverage information from personal social media accounts, company websites, conference webpages, and previous data leaks in order to carry out more effective social engineering attacks and gain initial access to systems to deploy ransomware.

Once ransomware threat actors have gained initial access, they typically aim to map out the network infrastructure of their target and to move laterally across the system by exploiting vulnerabilities and increasing their privileges. They will then deploy malware that encrypts their target’s data and demand a ransom from their victims, in exchange for restoring their files. To increase the pressure on their targets, many groups use scareware or additional extortion tactics. For instance, attackers may exfiltrate data before encrypting it and later threaten to leak sensitive information (double extortion), use service disruption attacks to cripple targets who are reluctant to pay (triple extortion), and even threaten their main victim’s third-party associates in order to increase the pressure (quadruple extortion).

However, in recent years INTERPOL has detected the growing use of data exfiltration for digital extortion. Following the initial intrusion into their target’s system, some ransomware groups now prefer to bypass the encryption stage and simply exfiltrate sensitive data. They then threaten to leak this information unless their victims pay a ransom. Because of the potential financial, reputational, and psychological damage from such leaks, many organizations appear more willing to pay. Ransom payments can reach several millions of dollars, even though there is no guarantee that the attackers will actually delete the stolen data. Due to its lucrative potential, data exfiltration is rapidly emerging as a key modus operandi, both instead of and in combination with encryption, transforming the ransomware, and digital extortion.

¹³ Fortinet (2023): https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/reports/report-2023-ransomware-global-research.pdf

Affiliate programs and the growth of the cybercriminal services ecosystem

Besides evolving modus operandi, the growing impact of ransomware may be partly attributed to the rise of new organizational models employed by cybercriminals. INTERPOL and its partners have detected that many ransomware groups now run elaborate affiliate programs, which involve the development of platforms offering ransomware as a service to third party criminals, known as “affiliates”. Affiliates can use the platforms provided by the core ransomware group to deploy malware, post exfiltrated data, and launder the proceeds of their crimes. In exchange for using the platform, the affiliates pay a fee to the core ransomware group, which can be a monthly subscription or a percentage of the ransom payments received through the platform.

As they become more mature, such ransomware-as-a-service operations are enabling cybercriminals to streamline processes and upscale their activities. They are also contributing to the emergence of new, more sophisticated and aggressive variants. Fortinet detected over 10,600 new ransomware variants in the first half of 2022, which is double the number seen in the six months prior.¹⁴ Crucially, affiliate programs and other ransomware-as-a-service operations draw on the continuous development and specialization of the cybercriminal services ecosystem. Core members of ransomware groups recruit various specialists to run the affiliate programs, including developers, pen-testers, system administrators, data managers, negotiators, recruiters, legal experts, and accountants.¹⁵ They also draw on external service providers, such as initial access brokers, and money laundering and bulletproof hosting services. For instance, Br0k3r, one of the most active initial access brokers targeting Africa and the Middle East, had over 60 offers to access corporate networks with domain administrate privileges for sale on its own online store in the past year.¹⁶ As core members, affiliates and service providers can be part of several groups, and it is important to disrupt the cybercriminal services ecosystem as a whole in order to effectively disrupt cybercrime.

OPERATION LANDSLIDE

Beginning in early 2023, INTERPOL initiated an operation code-named Landslide which targets the infrastructure that enables cybercrimes such as ransomware. The specific aim of operation Landslide was to take down an enabler of crime that for too long has been beyond the reach of law enforcement: bulletproof hosting (BPH). Working with authorities in the Seychelles and private partner Trend Micro, INTERPOL identified a number of bulletproof hosting providers involved in enabling illicit activities. Using the results of previous operational activities, INTERPOL succeeded in cleaning and taking down malicious infrastructure. The operation is ongoing.

Resilience to ransomware in Africa: significant progress and ongoing challenges

INTERPOL’s African member countries have taken significant steps to address the persistent threat of ransomware. For example, more than 60 per cent have introduced a cyber breach reporting mechanism to support the detection, mitigation, and investigation of attacks. States are also increasing collaboration with the private sector, with nearly two thirds of African member countries surveyed having established partnerships with private stakeholders in order to combat ransomware. In addition, African countries have reported increased efforts to raise companies’ awareness of the threat of cyber extortion. At a regional level, another positive development is the establishment of joint task forces involving law enforcement agencies across Africa in order to better respond to ransomware attacks and raise awareness about their impact.

Despite these significant achievements, member countries also reported ongoing challenges. The level of reporting by victims of ransomware attacks remains an issue, and affects law enforcement’s ability to launch investigations. Additionally, member countries reported that 16 per cent of victims ended up paying the ransom during ransomware attacks. Unfortunately, paying the ransom does not guarantee that the attack will stop, nor that the malicious software will be removed from systems. In some cases, the victim may not even get their data back, or will face double the recovery cost.¹⁷ In addition, paying the ransom does not prevent re-victimization. Worse, it may provide incentives and resources for ransomware actors to continue and expand their activities.
