# PART 1:
# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In 2008, application security, research, and analysis experts
set out to gather data on the different paths that organizations
take to address the challenges of securing software. Their goal
was to conduct in-person interviews with organizations that
were known to be highly effective in software security initiatives
(SSIs), gather details about their efforts, analyze the data, and
publish their findings to help others.

The result was the Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM),
a descriptive model—published as BSIMM1—that provides a
baseline of observed activities (i.e., controls) for SSIs to build
security into software and software development. Because
these initiatives often use different methodologies and different
terminology, the BSIMM also creates a common vocabulary
everyone can use. In addition, the BSIMM provides a common
methodology for starting and improving SSIs of any size and in
any vertical market.

Since BSIMM1 in 2009, we’ve been early reporters on security
program changes across people, process, technology, culture,
compliance, digital transformation, and much more. Welcome to
the BSIMM15 report, and thank you for reading.

# WELCOME TO BSIMM15

If you’re in charge of an SSI, understanding the BSIMM and its
use by participants will help you plan strategic improvements.
If you’re running the technical aspects of an initiative, you
can use the how-to guide (in Part 5) and activity descriptions
(in Part 8) to help define tactical improvements to people,
process, technology, and culture.

Each BSIMM annual report is the result of studying real-world
SSIs, which many organizations refer to as their application or
product security program or as their DevSecOps effort. Each year,
firms in different industry verticals use the BSIMM to create a
software security scorecard for their programs that they then use
to inform their SSI improvements. Here, we present BSIMM15 as
built directly out of the data we observed in 121 firms.

In the rapidly changing software security field, it’s important to
understand what other organizations are doing in their own SSIs.
Comparing the efforts of more than 100 companies to yours will
directly inform your strategy for improvement and growth.

BSIMM core knowledge is the activities we have directly observed
in our participants—the group of firms that use the BSIMM as
part of their SSI management. Each participant has their own
unique SSI with an emphasis on the building security in activities
important to their business objectives, but they collectively use
the activities captured here. We organize that core knowledge
into a software security framework (SSF), represented in Part
8. The SSF comprises four domains—Governance, Intelligence,
SSDL Touchpoints, and Deployment—with those domains
currently composed of 128 activities. The Governance domain,
for example, includes activities that fall under the organization,
management, and measurement efforts of an SSI.

From an executive perspective, you can view BSIMM activities
as preventive, detective, corrective, or compensating controls

implemented in a software security risk management
framework. Positioning the activities as controls allows for
easier understanding of the BSIMM’s value by governance, risk,
compliance, legal, audit, and other executive management groups.

As with any research work, some terms have specific meanings
in the BSIMM. The box below shows the most common BSIMM
terminology.

# BSIMM TERMINOLOGY

Nomenclature has always been a problem in computer
security, and software security is no exception. Several terms
used in the BSIMM have particular meaning for us, and the
following list highlights some of the most important ones
used in this document:

- Activity. Actions or efforts carried out or facilitated by the
SSG as part of a practice. Activities are divided into three
levels in the BSIMM based on observation rates.

- Capability. A set of BSIMM activities spanning one or
more practices working together to serve a cohesive
security function.

- Champions. A group of interested and engaged

developers, cloud security engineers, deployment
engineers, architects, software managers, testers, or
people in similar roles who have an active interest in
software security and contribute to the security posture of
the organization and its software.

- Data pool. The collection of assessment data from the

current participants.

- Domain. One of the four categories the framework
is divided into, i.e., Governance, Intelligence, SSDL
Touchpoints, and Deployment.

- Participants. The group of firms in the current data pool.

- Practice. A grouping of BSIMM activities. The SSF is

organized into 12 practices, three in each of four domains.

- Satellite. A group of individuals, often called security

champions, that is organized and leveraged by an SSG.
This has largely been replaced by the term security
champions.

- Secure SDL (SSDL). Any software lifecycle with integrated

software security checkpoints and activities.

- Software security framework (SSF). The basic structure
underlying the BSIMM, comprising 12 practices divided
into four domains.

- Software security group (SSG). The internal group
charged with carrying out and facilitating software
security. The group’s name might also have an appropriate
organizational focus, such as application security group
or product security group.

- Software security initiative (SSI). An organization-wide

program to instill, measure, manage, and evolve software
security activities in a coordinated fashion. Also referred
to in some organizations as an application security
program, product security program, or perhaps as a
DevSecOps program.

# BSIMM15 DATA HIGHLIGHTS

Use the information in this section to answer common
questions about BSIMM data, such as, “What are some data
pool statistics?,” “Which activities are most firms doing?,” and,
“How are software security efforts changing over time?”

Note: Items in italic purple refer to specific BSIMM activities in Part 8.

Activities are the building blocks of the BSIMM, the smallest
units of granularity implemented across organizations to build
SSIs. Rather than dictating a set of prescriptive activities, the
purpose of the BSIMM is to descriptively observe and quantify
the actual activities carried out by various kinds of SSIs across
many organizations.

The BSIMM is an observational model that reflects current
software security efforts, so we adjust it annually to keep it
current. For BSIMM15, we’ve made the following changes to the
model based on what we see in the BSIMM data pool:

- We moved the activities _enforce security checkpoints and_

_track exceptions, define secure deployment parameters and_
_configurations, have emergency response,_ and _streamline_
_incoming responsible vulnerability disclosure_ because we
now see them more frequently.

- We added the activities _create standards controlling and_
_guiding the adoption of new technologies_ and _protect_
_the integrity of development endpoints_ because we are
beginning to see them more.

Unique in the software security industry, the BSIMM project
has grown from nine participating companies in 2008 to 121
in 2024, now with approximately 3,400 software security group
(SSG) members and 7,700 security champions. The average age
of participants’ SSIs is 5.4 years, but the BSIMM project shows
consistent growth even as participants enter and leave over
time—we added nine firms for BSIMM15 and dropped 18 others
whose data hadn’t been refreshed (see Figure 21). Increasingly,
we see firms not just assessing their overall program but how
well they reach into their business units and teams as well.
While these business unit assessments provide valuable data to
the firms that request them, the data from these assessments is
not added to the data pool recorded in the annual report.

This 2024 edition of the BSIMM report—BSIMM15—examines
anonymized data from the software security activities of
121 organizations across different verticals, including cloud,
financial services, financial technology (FinTech), healthcare,
independent software vendors (ISVs), insurance, Internet of
Things (IoT), and technology organizations.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People explores the theory that
successful individuals share common qualities in achieving their
goals and that these qualities can be identified and applied by
others. The same premise can be applied to SSIs. Listed in Table
1 are the 10 most observed activities in the BSIMM15 data pool.
The data suggests that if your organization is working on its
own SSI, you should consider implementing these activities.

Table 2 shows some activities that have experienced
exceptionally high growth over the past 12 months. Not
surprisingly, some of these activities, such as _integrate_

_software-defined lifecycle governance_ and _provide expertise_
_via open collaboration channels,_ are mentioned in the Trends
and Insights section. In addition, the _streamline incoming_
_responsible vulnerability disclosure_ activity introduced in
BSIMM12 continues its strong growth in observation count as
we reported last year. Note that for some of the activities in
Table 2, the growth in observation is a relatively new change.
For example, the activity _have a research group that develops_
_new attack methods_ saw virtually no growth from BSIMM9 to
BSIMM12 but had a significant jump in observation rates in
BSIMM14, with BSIMM15 continuing that climb. Two years of
growth suggests the change is meaningful and the activities are
worth considering for your program.

In BSIMM14, we reported new growth after little change over
time in the _enforce security checkpoints and track exceptions_
activity. This activity has continued to grow in BSIMM15 as
firms are able to take advantage of modern automation options
in the development pipeline.

# TRENDS AND INSIGHTS SUMMARY

# CALL TO ACTION

The BSIMM trends and insights we’ve identified are a
distillation of software security lessons learned across
121 organizations that collectively have 11,100 security
professionals helping about 270,000 developers do good
security work on about 96,000 applications. Use this
information to inform your own strategy for improvement.

Trends describe shifts in SSI behavior that affect activity
implementation across multiple areas. Larger in scope
than an activity, or even a capability that combines multiple
activities within a workflow, we believe these trends show the
way organizations are executing groups of activities within
their evolving culture. In addition to the in-depth sections for
practitioners on regulatory impact on application security in Part
3, which also covers how application security and the BSIMM
are evolving in response to artificial intelligence (AI), we report
on trends in more depth in Part 2.

# MEETING GOVERNMENT
# REGULATIONS

In response to self-attestation requirements for selling software
to the US government, many firms have put special emphasis
on activities that can aid in compliance. One such mandate is
the need to build software bills of materials (SBOMs), and we
observed a 22% increase in [SE3.6] _create bills of materials_
_for deployed software_ and a 67% increase in observations of
[SE3.8] _perform application composition analysis on code_
_repositories_. Other areas include protecting source code, with
observations of [SE2.4] _protect code integrity_ increasing by
~20% while [SE3.2] _use code protection_ increased by ~45%.

# SECURE INNOVATION

In BSIMM15, we introduced [SR3.5] _create standards controlling_
_and guiding the adoption of new technologies,_ to measure how
firms build security before the industry comes to a consensus
on best practices. However, other activities can aid firms in
preparing for these new challenges and opportunities. Building
and testing potential attacks, for example, are on the rise, with
observations of [AM2.8] _have a research group that develops_
_new attack methods_ increasing by ~30% and [ST3.5] _begin to_
_build and apply adversarial tests (abuse cases)_ observations
doubling from BSIMM14 to BSIMM15. As firms capture
innovative solutions in the form of secure design patterns,
observations of [SFD3.3] _find and publishing secure design_
_patterns from the organization_ increased by ~45% and [SE1.4]
_define secure deployment parameters and configurations_ saw
a ~15% increase over BSIMM14.

> Take stock of your SSI. It’s
> important to periodically
> look at your program
> through a different lens.

Use the information in this section to prioritize improvements
in your SSI and perhaps also in the SSIs of your most
important software suppliers and partners.

Every SSI has room for improvement, whether it’s improving
scale, effectiveness, depth, risk management, the framework of
deployed activities, resourcing, or anything similar. The following
suggestions represent the broad efforts we see happening
in BSIMM participants, with various parts likely right for your
program as well.

# PLAN YOUR JOURNEY

- Take stock of your SSI. It’s important to periodically look
at your program through a different lens, and the BSIMM
enables that. Use the guidance in Part 5 to create your own
SSI scorecard and compare it to your expectations.

- Create a vision and a strategic plan. Use the activity

descriptions in Part 8 when creating a prioritized action plan
for business areas where your current SSI efforts fall short.
Typical investment areas include risk management, digital
transformation, technical debt removal, technology insertion,
and process improvement.

# GET A HANDLE ON WHAT YOU HAVE

- Inventory all your code. It’s likely that you’ll need specialized
automation to keep track of all the code you write and all the
code you bring in from outside the organization. A simple
application inventory will be useful for some things, such as
naming risk managers, but you’ll quickly need specialized
inventories, such as SBOMs, API and microservices lists,
various as-code artifacts, code that is subject to specific
compliance needs, and much more.

- Automate, automate, automate. Search for ways to eliminate
error-prone manual processes and reduce friction between
governance and engineering groups, including automating
security decisions. This will require some policy-as-code
effort and tools integration and might require bringing
development skills into the SSG.

- Gather all the data. As more processes become code, and
more policies and standards become machine-readable,
day-to-day development and operations will generate
significantly more telemetry about what’s happening and
why. Use this data to ensure that everything’s working as
expected.

# MAKE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS

- Innovate in digital transformation. Encourage your SSG
and other security stakeholders to experiment with ways to
deliver security value directly into engineering processes,
especially where current security testing tools don’t always
keep up with engineering changes, such as with serverless
architectures, single-page applications, AI, and zero trust.

- Secure the software supply chain. Nearly every organization
today uses third-party code and provides code as a third

party to other organizations. While producing SBOMs is easy,
the management of software, SBOMs themselves, vendors,
and vulnerability information is much more complicated.

- Expand software security into adjacencies. Even perfect
software can have its security undermined by mistakes
elsewhere in the organization. Make explicit ties between the
SSI and other security stakeholders working in areas such
as container security, orchestration security, cloud security,
infrastructure security, and site reliability.

In summary, the data shows that new SSIs—from just started to
18 months old—are typically doing about 33 BSIMM activities.
These organizations are also beginning to scale these activities
across their software portfolio, deal with all the change going on
around them, and evolve their risk management strategy.

# SOME READING SUGGESTIONS FOR
# THIS REPORT

- If you’re experienced with the BSIMM, or if you need
some content to help make your case with executive
management, then Part 2 (Trends and Insights) is
probably what you’re looking for.

- If this is your first time with the BSIMM, we recommend
first reading Part 5 for context and then returning here to
decide what to read next.

- If you’re starting an SSI or an SSG, or looking to mature
an existing program, start with Part 5 (Quick Guide to SSI
Maturity), then move to Part 3’s How to Build or Upgrade
an SSI, then read through the activities in Part 8.

- If you want to get right into the types of software security
controls organizations are using in their SSIs, or if you are
working on building out capabilities, then read Part 8 (The
BSIMM Activities).

- If you want to see a summary of the BSIMM15 data,
review Part 9.

- If you want to look at our analysis of the BSIMM data,
review Part 9.

# THE BSIMM SKELETON
The BSIMM skeleton provides a way to view activities at a
glance, which is useful when thinking about your own SSI.
The skeleton is shown in Figure 1, organized by domains and
practices. A detailed version that includes activity references
and level information is also available in Part 7. More complete
descriptions of the activities and examples are available in Part
8 of this document.

Use this skeleton to understand the software security
activities included in BSIMM15. A list of software security
controls can be a very helpful guide here; the BSIMM project
has worked since 2008 to ensure that its content matches
real-world efforts.

# PART 2:
# TRENDS AND
# INSIGHTS

# PART 2: TRENDS AND INSIGHTS

BSIMM data originates in interviews conducted with member
firms during a BSIMM assessment. Through these in-depth
conversations, assessors look for the existence of BSIMM
activities and assign credit for those that are performed
with sufficient coverage across the organization, have the
formality to be repeatable and consistent, and show the
depth to be effective at managing associated risks. After
each assessment, the observation data is added to the
BSIMM data pool, where statistical analysis is performed to
highlight trends in how firms secure their software.

You can use this information to understand what other
organizations in your vertical are doing to then inform your
own strategy.

This year has been defined by firms adjusting to the industry-
wide shake-ups of the previous year as they continue to adjust
to the challenges and opportunities presented by AI and large
language models (LLMs) while building application security
programs that are in compliance with government mandates.
Companies behind DevSecOps platforms, cloud solutions,
and security tooling are rising to the challenges from both the
marketplace and attackers to make it easier for developers to
automate security tooling and processes. This year marks the
15th iteration of the BSIMM15 framework, and we are reporting
on long-term trends from the data pool.

# THE EVOLUTION OF SHIFT
# EVERYWHERE
As automation and modern pipelines continue to handle more
and more software development tasks, firms are integrating
security governance and tests into their development platforms.
While interest in shift left has only continued to grow over time,
the BSIMM data shows firms adopting the shift everywhere
philosophy. Organizations start to implement shift left to control
the excessive costs, efforts, and risks associated with testing
for security defects only just before promotion to production.
This large friction point helped drive the development and
adoption of SAST tooling, which drove the software industry to
shift testing to the left in the SDLC, a place where vulnerabilities
could be found and fixed faster and for less money. More
recently, shift left was expanded to a broader testing philosophy
where firms would also test designs and other development
artifacts (e.g., golden masters, configurations, anything done as-
code) as soon as they were ready, which marked the beginning
of shift everywhere.

# GOVERNANCE AND AUTOMATION

The core tenets of shift everywhere lie in taking advantage of
automation to put data collection and decisions as close to
the software development process as required. The activity
[SM3.4] _integrate software-defined lifecycle governance_ was
introduced in BSIMM10 and has seen slow but steady progress,
growing nearly 48% in the past year to reach 9.1% of the 121
firms. Additionally, because it is bad practice to mandate

# WHAT IS SHIFT EVERYWHERE, REALLY?

To define shift everywhere, let’s start by stating what it’s not: it’s not trying to do all the security things everywhere
in all parts of the software lifecycle (SLC) all the time. Instead, shift everywhere is a philosophy; it’s an approach
to SLC governance that acknowledges the reality that consistently achieving acceptably secure software is a
shared responsibility and that this responsibility traverses legal, audit, risk, governance, IT, cloud, technology,
vendor management, and resilience, among others. Each stakeholder has their own business processes to
execute, but each also needs to do their version of security sign-off, which requires understandable and usable
telemetry from the SLC toolchain.

Not so long ago, the only view into the SLC afforded to stakeholders was, “We shipped it yesterday!” That was
horrible then and is much worse now, mainly because automation generates telemetry that is easy to route to
stakeholders. A shift everywhere approach starts by asking how these roles get the information they need, when
they need it, in the processes they normally use, with little or no additional friction, then it bridges that gap, giving
each role access to appropriate sensors, whenever they need it, from anywhere in the SLC. Shift everywhere is a
philosophy about the security testing and sensors that generate information for all stakeholders in the company,
it’s not rooted in increasing the security spend or effort. Accordingly, shift everywhere is not adding more
security for security’s sake, instead, it’s ensuring that every security stakeholder can knowledgably make risk
management decisions.

unsustainable security measures, the ease of automation has
removed that barrier and allowed firms to [CR1.5] _make code_
_review mandatory for all projects,_ with an observation increase
of about 72% since BSIMM10. Additionally, deciding when a
test is required in the development is essential to ensuring that
software is evaluated for risk at the most appropriate time,
and observations of [ST3.6] _implement event-driven security_
_testing in automation_ grew by 43% from BSIMM14 to BSIMM15.
Automating decisions and governance allows firms to manage
risk in real time.

# ENABLING PEOPLE

As firms further integrate security testing into the SDLC,
developers are faced with an increasing duty to understand
and respond to security defects as they’re discovered and
