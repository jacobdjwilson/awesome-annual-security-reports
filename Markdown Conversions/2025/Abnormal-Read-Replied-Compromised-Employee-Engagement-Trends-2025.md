## Executive Summary

Your workforce is your greatest asset, and your vendors are

integral to the success of the enterprise. It’s no surprise, then,

that cybercriminals are targeting both, exploiting the trust in

these partnerships to deceive, defraud, and divert funds.

Much like traditional business email compromise (BEC), vendor email

compromise (VEC) involves the misuse of a familiar identity. In these attacks,

however, the person being impersonated is an external third party rather

than an internal employee. Posing as trusted partners, threat actors

attempt to trick targets into paying fake invoices, initiating fraudulent

wire transfers, or updating banking details to reroute funds into

attacker-controlled accounts.

Behavioral Data Reveals Alarming VEC Engagement Rates

From March 2024 to March 2025, we monitored the email environments

of more than 1,400 organizations of various sizes across multiple

industries. These companies had implemented Abnormal in passive,

read-only mode, which means the platform was integrated with the

organization’s mail client but not actively blocking attacks.

This allowed us to observe unfiltered employee behavior and analyze

engagement with text-based advanced email attacks—e.g., business

email compromise, vendor email compromise, reconnaissance, and

extortion. To enable cross-organizational comparison, we standardized

the data by using only attacks that were read, eliminating volume as a

variable and allowing conclusions to be drawn based on user behavior

rather than incident frequency.

Our findings were eye-opening. The data revealed that employees

frequently struggle to differentiate between legitimate messages and

attacks, especially when those emails appear to come from a known

vendor. VEC attacks consistently drove either the highest or second-

highest rates of replies and forwards, irrespective of organization size,

industry, or geographic location. Over the course of the observation

period, attackers also attempted to steal more than $300 million through

VEC, emphasizing the significant financial risk these threats pose.

This report exposes the behavioral blind spots attackers are exploiting

and underscores the urgency of reducing exposure to malicious content.

## Inside the Threat: Why VEC Works

All text-based advanced email attacks are insidious and deceptive, but there are a few aspects of

vendor email compromise that make it especially difficult to detect. First is the inherent financial nature

of the vendor-customer dynamic and the fact that billing and payments are routinely discussed via

email. Consequently, malicious messages seemingly from vendors requesting changes to banking

information or large fund transfers may not be immediately flagged as suspicious.

Further, the scale of some supply chains makes it nearly impossible for employees to be well-versed in

every vendor’s operations. Therefore, they simply don’t have the context to recognize when a request

is out of the ordinary. Even when the target is knowledgeable about the standard processes and which

parties are usually involved, there is no guarantee that they will discern that something is amiss.

Cybercriminals who engage in VEC will monitor ongoing correspondence, learn typical patterns
and behaviors, and patiently wait until the ideal time to strike. Often, they will download older invoices

or statements and alter only the bank account information, leaving the modified documents essentially

indistinguishable from the originals.

Threat actors will also use spoofed sender addresses or look-alike domains to increase the appearance

of authenticity. Some even leverage actual compromised vendor accounts, frequently hijacking existing

email threads to carry out the attack. The emails, originating from a legitimate account with no history

of suspicious behavior, bypass signature-based security tools and land in the inboxes of employees who

have no reason to believe the message is malicious.

The Role of AI in Amplifying Vendor Email Compromise

VEC occurs at a lower rate than other threats, like phishing, for several reasons. Chief among them is that attackers tend to

choose the path of least resistance, and vendor email compromise, though lucrative, is a high-effort attack type. That being said,

with the added capabilities of weaponized AI, even low-skill cybercriminals are increasingly able to execute these sophisticated,

socially engineered attacks.

With AI-powered tools, attackers can generate remarkably believable messages that mirror real vendor communications,

complete with realistic language, formatting, and urgency cues. In a tight job market, with economic uncertainty and persistent

layoff concerns, employees may rush to resolve an apparent oversight—like a missing payment—without verifying the request.

AI further amplifies this risk by helping bad actors make fraudulent invoices and follow-up messages more persuasive,

increasing the likelihood of success.

Reducing your risk to threats like vendor email compromise requires an understanding of attack trends

and the unique vulnerabilities upon which threat actors capitalize to infiltrate an organization.

## VEC Risks Increase with Organization Size

Employees in the largest organizations—i.e., those with a workforce
of 50,000 or more—had the highest rate of second-step engagement[^1]
with vendor email compromise. After reading a VEC message, they

took additional action 72.3% of the time.

## Sector by Sector: Where VEC
Drives the Highest Engagement

Industry type emerged as a critical factor in VEC susceptibility,

with engagement rates varying dramatically based on

operational characteristics.

technology partners to deliver services. They also have large,

an environment where email serves as a critical coordination

channel between internal teams and external partners.

In an industry where disruptions and delays can have wide-

by SLAs and internal expectations regarding responsiveness—

can result in employees bypassing verification processes in

favor of speed.

One notable trend was the clear correlation between an employee’s

organizational role and their likelihood of engaging with vendor email

compromise attacks.

## Across Borders: VEC and BEC
Trends by Region

Because the 1,400 organizations in this analysis span North America, EMEA,

and APAC, the data offers a unique opportunity to examine how employee

behavior varies by geographic location. While engagement patterns differed

across regions, one trend remained consistent: second-step interaction rates

with both BEC and VEC were alarmingly high.

Taking a more granular look at the data, several interesting trends emerge.

![BEC and VEC Engagement by Region: Business Email Compromise, Vendor Email Compromise bar graph]

**EMEA: External Impersonation Is a Blind Spot**

For organizations in EMEA, the second-step engagement rate with VEC eclipsed that of BEC, exceeding it by 90%. Additionally,

the repeat engagement rate for VEC was over twice as high for BEC and the highest of any geographic region. Interestingly,

EMEA employees had the lowest reporting rate for vendor email compromise attacks—a shockingly low 0.27%—but the highest

reporting rate for BEC attacks: 4.22%. They also had the lowest rate of second-step engagement with BEC (24.7%).

**The Bottom Line**

EMEA employees appear to be highly susceptible to continued interaction with VEC attacks but resistant to engaging

with BEC, indicating vulnerability to external impersonations and suggesting stronger skepticism toward imitation

of internal identities.

This disparity may stem from greater implicit trust in vendors or external partners across EMEA organizations, particularly

given the high volume of cross-border business facilitated by mechanisms like the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). SEPA

is a payment integration initiative designed to make cross-border euro payments as easy as domestic payments by requiring

standardized formats for transactions.

**APAC: Cultural and Compliance
Factors Shape Risk**

For APAC organizations, the data trended in the opposite direction of EMEA

enterprises, with BEC engagement surpassing VEC. Though the variation

is not as dramatic—BEC second-step engagement is just 10% higher—the

rate itself (44.4%) remains concerning. Additionally, APAC employees had

the highest BEC repeat engagement rate of any region (5.65%). However,

while APAC employees engage with BEC attacks more than VEC, they

at least report those attacks at a substantially higher rate, albeit still at a

significantly lower than desired frequency (1.92%). Notably, APAC had the

lowest vendor email compromise second-step engagement rate across all

regions (40.24%), but even that remains far above acceptable levels.

**The Bottom Line**

In contrast to other regions, BEC poses the greater risk for APAC

employees, with higher engagement and repeat interaction rates, but their

comparatively higher reporting rate for BEC signals better recognition of

internal threats.

The higher BEC engagement and repeat rates may reflect the influence of strict, region-specific invoicing and documentation

requirements, such as China’s fapiao system, which could make vendor fraud attempts less convincing or easier to detect.

Additionally, cultural factors—such as more hierarchical workplace dynamics in parts of the region—may contribute to

employees being more likely to comply with authority-driven requests (a hallmark of BEC) without questioning their legitimacy.

**North America: Equal Opportunity for Exploitation**

Employees at organizations in North America demonstrated equal vulnerability to BEC and VEC attacks, with a negligible

difference between the second-step engagement rates for both attack types. However, similar to EMEA, the repeat

engagement rate for VEC attacks was considerably higher than for BEC attacks—7.42% vs. 2.69%. This indicates employees

may not recognize they’ve been manipulated, increasing the risk of repeated engagement without targeted intervention or

improved training. Like their counterparts in EMEA and APAC, North American organizations reported BEC attacks more often

than VEC, though reporting remained low overall.

**The Bottom Line**

North American employees engage with VEC and BEC attacks at nearly equal rates but are more likely to fall for vendor email

compromise attacks repeatedly, suggesting greater challenges in recognizing vendor-based deception.

The equal engagement rates indicate both internal and external impersonation attacks are equally believable to employees.

However, the much higher VEC repeat engagement rate may reveal gaps in vendor verification processes and/or blind spots

in security awareness training. This highlights the need for more targeted education on identifying vendor-based threats,

particularly those that blend into routine workflows.

## The Reporting Deficit
in Email Security

If your organization relies on employee reporting to understand the full extent

of attack frequency, we have bad news: only 1.46% of text-based advanced

email attacks that are read are reported.

To put that in perspective, the average monthly text-based

advanced attacks received by a mid-market enterprise with

organizations, the number can be much, much higher.

Why Aren’t Employees Reporting Malicious Emails?

**The Bystander Effect**

Though most often associated with emergencies, the bystander effect can occur in any setting where multiple individuals

share equal responsibility to act. It refers to the tendency of people to do nothing when others are also present or impacted.

Essentially, the more people who could act, the less likely it is that anyone will.

In this context, an employee may believe they aren’t the only target of an attack, and thus they don’t report the message

because they assume a colleague already has. What should be emphasized is that even if a cybercriminal targets multiple

employees, the sooner a malicious email is reported, the easier it is for the SOC team to minimize damage.

**No Harm, No Foul**

Some employees may believe that as long as they don’t engage with the attacker, they’ve fulfilled their obligation to the

organization. But security professionals know that deleting emails without reporting them can be almost as damaging,

since it eliminates the SOC team’s chance to investigate, remediate related messages, and take steps to reduce vulnerabilities

to similar attacks.

Employees must understand that a message that they recognize as attempted invoice fraud or a bogus account update

may not raise red flags for a coworker. And if attacks go unreported, bad actors can continue targeting others.

**Fear of Being Wrong**

In some cases, an employee may feel uncertain about their ability to distinguish safe emails from attacks. Rather than risk

flagging benign messages, they stay silent, either out of fear of looking foolish or creating unnecessary work for the security

team. This hesitation is especially common when cybersecurity feels disconnected from day-to-day responsibilities.

But this fear-based inaction can be costly, as a single overlooked attack can lead to widespread compromise if not caught in

time. That’s why it’s essential to foster a workplace culture where reporting suspicious messages is encouraged, even when

they turn out to be false alarms. Employees should be reassured that it’s always better to err on the side of caution.

## Thread Hijacked: Inside a Vendor
Impersonation Attack

Note: This attack was observed during a risk assessment in which Abnormal was operating in read-only mode,

which is why it was not proactively blocked.

Though awareness of modern attack tactics is growing, many professionals still operate under the assumption that today’s

email threats are just as poorly worded or obviously malicious as those from ten years ago. But today’s cybercriminals

continually improve their strategies and launch attacks that not only bypass legacy security tools but also trigger no alarm

bells for the average employee, as these messages appear indistinguishable from real communications.

In the example below, the attacker poses as an employee at a construction equipment rental company, hijacks an existing

thread with a partner, and attempts to divert future invoice payments.

The first email in a thread was a legitimate message from “T.B.,” a project manager at the equipment rental organization, to

“L.W.,” an employee at a contracting services company, regarding an invoice for services rendered.

![Email 1: From T.B. to L.W. regarding revised invoice]

Three weeks after this email was sent, the bad actor hijacked the thread using a lookalike domain, which was registered

about a week and a half earlier and differs by only one letter from the real domain—a nearly imperceptible change. For privacy

purposes, all identifying information has been censored, but a comparable example would be if the real domain were

missionus.com and the attacker’s email address was hosted on misionus.com.

Posing as “J.B.,” an accounts receivable specialist at the construction equipment rental company, the perpetrator contacted

L.W. regarding an update to the organization’s payment processes. To increase the appearance of legitimacy, the threat actor

copied and pasted the text of a fake email into the thread, making it seem as if they were following up on a previous message.

![Email 2: From J.B. to L.W. regarding an important update]

The fabricated message claimed that due to an ongoing account reconciliation audit, the company’s operating account had

become inactive, and they were transitioning to electronic payments. The cybercriminal requested acknowledgment of the

message so they could send new banking details. (As a note, had the customer not been in read-only mode, this is the point at

which Abnormal would have remediated the message.)

The email contained no malicious links or attachments and had only minor grammar and punctuation issues. The attacker also

used the impersonated employee’s real email signature with the company’s contact information and replaced T.B.’s address

with a lookalike version hosted on the same maliciously registered domain.

Simply put, to most employees, the email would raise zero red flags, which is likely why L.W. replied to the threat actor

and even added two colleagues to the thread to assist with the request.

![Email 3: From L.W. to J.B. and others acknowledging the update]

Shortly after the target replied, the cybercriminal emailed again, this time posing as the project manager, T.B. To manufacture

a sense of urgency, the bad actor claimed that the contracting services company had multiple outstanding invoices that were

more than two months overdue.

![Email 4: From T.B. to L.W. and others requesting payment]

L.W. once more responded and confirmed that as soon as the updated bank account information was provided,

payment would be initiated.

![Email 5: From L.W. to T.B. and others confirming payment will be initiated]

At this point, Abnormal stepped in to prevent the attack from moving forward, despite being in passive-only mode.

This attack underscores the increasing sophistication of vendor email compromise and the adept use of social engineering

techniques by threat actors to exploit human trust. It also highlights the critical need to reduce employee exposure to malicious

content and limit opportunities for engagement.

## Why Behavioral AI
Is the Best Defense Against
Human-Centric Threats

Every time an employee has to decide whether an email is

legitimate, the risk of human error enters the equation.
And if they’re wrong, cybercriminals won’t hesitate to

capitalize and cause financial consequences that ripple

across the enterprise.

Today’s threat actors know how to “hack the human”

and continually develop new strategies for manipulating

employees. They exploit human trust, compromise legitimate

vendors, and weaponize routine business workflows.

The challenge is that organizations have limited control over

their vendors’ security postures and can only take steps to

ensure their vendors’ vulnerabilities can’t be used against

them. While security awareness training helps reduce the

likelihood of employees engaging with threat actors, it’s not

enough on its own. Humans can’t be your last line of defense.

The only effective strategy is to remove the burden of

detection from employees entirely. That requires an
innovative security solution—one that leverages AI to

analyze identity, context, and content and builds behavioral

baselines for every employee and vendor in your cloud

environment. By understanding an organization’s unique

communication patterns, an AI-native email security platform

can detect subtle behavioral anomalies that traditional tools

miss, enabling it to flag suspicious communications and

automatically remediate threats before they reach

employee inboxes.

Precision matters—because detecting what doesn’t

belong starts with understanding what does.
