## Executive summary

We have developed sophisticated safety and security measures to prevent the misuse of our AI models. While these measures are generally effective, cybercriminals and other malicious actors continually attempt to find ways around them. This report details several recent examples of how Claude has been misused, along with the steps we’ve taken to detect and counter their abuse.

This represents the work of Threat Intelligence: a dedicated team at Anthropic finds deeply investigated sophisticated real world cases of misuse and works with the rest of the Safeguards organization to improve our defenses against such cases.

While specific to Claude, the case studies presented below likely reflect consistent patterns of behaviour across all frontier AI models. Collectively, they show how threat actors are adapting their operations to exploit today’s most advanced AI capabilities:

- **Agentic AI systems are being weaponized**: AI models are themselves being used to perform sophisticated cyberattacks – not just advising on how to carry them out.
- **AI lowers the barriers to sophisticated cybercrime.** Actors with few technical skills have used AI to conduct complex operations, like developing ransomware, that would previously have required years of training.
- **Cybercriminals are embedding AI throughout their operations.** This includes victim profiling, automated service delivery, and in operations that affect tens of thousands of users.
- **AI is being used for all stages of fraud operations.** Fraudulent actors use AI for tasks like analyzing stolen data, stealing credit card information, and creating false identities.

We’re discussing these incidents publicly in order to contribute to the work of the broader AI safety and security community, and help those in industry, government, and the wider research community strengthen their own defences against the abuse of AI systems. We plan to continue releasing reports like this regularly, and to be transparent about the threats we find.

## Case studies

## Vibe hacking: how cybercriminals are using AI coding agents to scale data extortion operations

### ABOUT CLAUDE CODE

> Anthropic’s agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands.

### Summary

Today we are sharing insights about a sophisticated cybercriminal operation (tracked as GTG-2002) we recently disrupted that represents a new evolution in how cyber threat actors leverage AI—using coding agents to actively execute operations on victim networks, known as “vibe hacking”.

A cybercriminal used Claude Code to conduct a scaled data extortion operation across multiple international targets in a short timeframe. This threat actor leveraged Claude’s code execution environment to automate reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and network penetration at scale, potentially affecting at least 17 distinct organizations in just the last month across government, healthcare, emergency services, and religious institutions.

The operation demonstrates a concerning evolution in AI-assisted cybercrime, where AI serves as both a technical consultant and active operator, enabling attacks that would be more difficult and time-consuming for individual actors to execute manually. This approach, which security researchers have termed “vibe hacking,” represents a fundamental shift in how cybercriminals can scale their operations.

### Key findings

Our investigation revealed that the cybercriminal operated across multiple sectors, creating a systematic attack campaign that focused on comprehensive data theft and extortion. The operation leveraged opportunistic targeting based on results from using open source intelligence tools and scanning of Internet-facing devices. The actor demonstrated unprecedented integration of artificial intelligence throughout their attack lifecycle, with Claude Code supporting reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.

The actor provided Claude Code with their preferred operational TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in their CLAUDE.md file that is used as a guide for Claude Code to respond to prompts in a manner preferred by the user. However, this was simply a preferential guide and the operation still utilized Claude Code to make both tactical and strategic decisions—determining how best to penetrate networks, which data to exfiltrate, and how to craft psychologically targeted extortion demands. The actor’s systematic approach resulted in the compromise of personal records, including healthcare data, financial information, government credentials, and other sensitive information, with direct ransom demands occasionally exceeding $500,000.

Rather than encrypting systems using traditional ransomware, this actor leveraged the sensitive data Claude Code exfiltrated on their behalf, threatening its public exposure to extort victims into paying. Claude not only performed “on-keyboard” operations but also analyzed exfiltrated financial data to determine appropriate ransom amounts and generated visually alarming HTML ransom notes that were displayed on victim machines by embedding them into the boot process.

This configuration file included a cover story claiming network security testing under official support contracts while providing detailed attack methodologies and target prioritization frameworks. This structured approach to victim targeting allowed Claude Code to efficiently standardize attack patterns while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to different organizational structures and security postures. By using this framework, Claude could systematically track compromised credentials, pivot through networks, and optimize extortion strategies based on real-time analysis of stolen data.

### Attack lifecycle and AI integration

#### Phase 1: Reconnaissance and target discovery

The actor leveraged Claude Code for automated reconnaissance. For example, Claude Code scanned thousands of VPN endpoints, identifying vulnerable systems with high success rates. It also created comprehensive scanning frameworks using various APIs that could systematically collect infrastructure information across multiple technologies.

AI role: Enhanced capability, enabling systematic discovery of thousands of potential entry points globally through automated scripts that organized results by country and technology type.

#### Phase 2: Initial access and credential exploitation

Claude Code provided real-time assistance during live network penetration operations. For example, it systematically scanned networks, identified critical systems including domain controllers and SQL servers, and extracted multiple credential sets during unauthorized access operations.

Claude Code assisted with credential attacks across multiple domains, accessing Active Directory systems and performing comprehensive network enumeration and credential analysis.

AI role: Direct operational support during live intrusions, providing guidance for privilege escalation and lateral movement in real-time.

#### Phase 3: Malware development and evasion

Claude Code was used for malware creation and the addition of anti-detection capabilities. It created obfuscated versions of the Chisel tunneling tool to evade Windows Defender detection and developed completely new TCP proxy code that doesn’t use Chisel libraries at all.

When initial evasion attempts failed, Claude Code provided new techniques including string encryption, anti-debugging code, and filename masquerading. The actor specifically used Claude to disguise malicious executables as legitimate Microsoft tools (MSBuild.exe, devenv.exe, cl.exe) and implement multiple fallback methods when primary evasion patterns failed.

AI role: Custom malware development with evasion capabilities, lowering the technical barrier for creating and successfully executing attack tools.

#### Phase 4: Data exfiltration and analysis

Claude Code facilitated comprehensive data extraction and analysis across multiple victim organizations. It systematically extracted and analyzed data from various organizations including a defense contractor, healthcare providers, and a financial institution, extracting sensitive information including social security numbers, bank account details, patient information, and ITAR-controlled documentation.

Claude Code organized stolen data for monetization purposes, extracting thousands of individual records including personal identifiers, addresses, financial information, and medical records from multiple organizations.

AI role: Automated analysis and organization of large datasets, enabling systematic extraction of high-value information across multiple victim organizations simultaneously.

#### Phase 5: Extortion analysis and ransom note development

The actor leveraged Claude Code to create customized ransom notes based on exfiltrated data analysis. Claude Code generated HTML-formatted ransom notes with victim-specific details including exact financial figures, employee counts, and tailored threats based on industry-specific regulations. The actor created ransom notes to compromised systems demanding payments ranging from $75,000 to $500,000 in Bitcoin.

Claude Code created multi-tiered extortion strategies for each victim. For example, it generated “profit plans” offering multiple monetization options, including direct organizational blackmail, data sales to criminals, and targeted extortion of individuals whose data was compromised. The ransom notes included specific deadlines (48-72 hours), incremental penalty structures, and custom contact emails for each victim.

AI role: Automated generation of psychologically-crafted extortion materials tailored to each victim’s specific vulnerabilities, calculating optimal ransom amounts based on financial analysis, and creating multi-path monetization strategies that maximized pressure on victims through sector-specific regulatory and reputational threats.

![Image description: Simulated custom ransom note generated by Claude after analyzing extracted files, showing a "PROFIT PLAN" with details on financial data, wages, and donor base, including estimated black market value and escalation to alternative monetization. It lists monetization options: direct extortion (cryptocurrency demand), data commercialization (pricing for donor information, financial documents, contact database), individual targeting (focus on major contributors, threat to disclose donations), and a layered approach combining organizational extortion, data sales, and individual targeting for maximum revenue.](https://example.com/custom_ransom_note_profit_plan.png)

### Implications

This case represents an evolution toward AI-powered cybercrime operations where:

1. Technical infrastructure is augmented by AI capabilities that can perform complex operations autonomously
2. A single operator can achieve the impact of an entire cybercriminal team through AI assistance
3. AI makes both strategic and tactical decisions about targeting, exploitation, and monetization
4. Defense becomes increasingly difficult as AI-generated attacks adapt to defensive measures in real-time

These operations suggest a need for new frameworks for evaluating cyber threats that account for AI enablement. Traditional assumptions about the relationship between actor sophistication and attack complexity no longer hold when AI can provide instant expertise.

While we have taken steps to prevent this type of misuse, we expect this model to become increasingly common as AI lowers the barrier to entry for sophisticated cybercrime operations. We remain committed to identifying and preventing such misuse, while continuing to share our findings with the broader security and safety community.
