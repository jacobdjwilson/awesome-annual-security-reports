## 2025 SecurityScorecard
## Global Third-Party
## Breach Report
From Ratings to Resilience

Modern cybersecurity isn’t failing because
organizations are ignoring threats—it’s failing
because they’re looking in the wrong direction.

While security teams work to secure their own networks, attackers are already finding ways in through the
back door—exploiting vendors, suppliers, and software providers to infiltrate organizations without ever
touching their carefully monitored perimeters.

In 2024, at least 35.5% of all data breaches originated from third-party compromises, up 6.5% from the
previous year. This number is likely an undercount, as many organizations may be unaware of or choose
not to disclose the third-party origins of their breaches.

So while you’re updating your firewall rules, somewhere in your supply chain a vendor might be
inadvertently letting in the very attackers you’ve been working to keep out. And these attackers have
figured out it’s much easier to enter through a partner that already has trusted access.

### Why We’re Here

At SecurityScorecard, we believe you can’t fix what you can’t see. That’s why we analyzed 1,000 data
breaches across all industries and geographic areas to uncover the true scale of third-party cyber
risk.

Our mission is to help you illuminate these blind spots and transform how you manage your extended
security perimeter.

### What You’ll Learn
- This report answers key questions including:
- How third-party risks have evolved since 2023
- Which industries and geographic areas experience the highest
frequency of third-party breaches
- What specific vendor relationships are being exploited most
frequently
- Which threat actors are behind these supply chain compromises
- The software vulnerabilities that continue to enable successful
attacks
- How to move beyond traditional assessments to more effective
security measures

Bad actors aren’t just
breaking into homes
anymore—they’re
breaking into the
factories that make
the locks for the doors.

Don’t let a third party
check become checkmate

More than 1 in 3 breaches (35.5%) now come through third parties—attackers aren’t breaking in;
they’re logging in with your partners’ credentials while you’re busy patching your own systems.

Industries in the crosshairs
- Retail & Hospitality
A staggering 52.4% of all breaches
come through third parties
- Critical Infrastructure
Energy and utilities face a 46.7%
third-party breach rate
- Technology industries
experience disproportionately
high rates of third-party breaches
relative to total breach volume
- Healthcare
has a large share of third-party
breaches due to high overall
breach volume

The cascading
impact

Global vulnerability landscape
More affluent countries may have stronger security
but also have higher third-party breach rates:

The calculated attack
strategy

- 4.5% of breaches now
extend to fourth parties—
one breach triggers multiple
organizational failures
- Singapore
- Netherlands
- Japan
71.4% 70.4% 60%

- Foreign subsidiaries are
2× more likely to be breach
sources than domestic ones

- The U.S. has the largest absolute
number of third-party breaches due
to overall high breach volume

- Chinese state-sponsored groups
actively target supply chains and
third-party access points across
North America, Europe, and Asia

The bottom line

- Ransomware Connection: 41.4% of
ransomware attacks now start through
third parties
- The ransomware group C10p stands out
as the most proliﬁc user of third-party
access vectors, as it did in last year’s
report.
- Just two vulnerability exploits in ﬁle
transfer software caused 63.5% of all
vulnerability-based breaches
- Software Supply Chain Under Siege:
File transfer software vulnerabilities
have become the most common attack
vector for third-party breaches
- State-sponsored cyber espionage
campaigns from China frequently
leverage third-party access.

- Traditional security is looking in the
wrong direction, leaving organizations
vulnerable to attacks that bypass their
own defenses entirely
- Adversaries use third-party access
vectors for scalability—compromising
multiple organizations through a single
vulnerable entry point

## The Data
OSINT, Threat Intelligence &
Underground Research

Unlike other reports that rely solely on self-reported data (we see you, survey-based studies), this
study integrates real-world breach intelligence gathered by SecurityScorecard’s STRIKE Threat
Intelligence Unit. Most breaches in our sample were not third-party related—this was intentional to
provide a broader comparison sample and identify ways in which third-party breaches differ from the
general risk landscape.

Our definition of a third-party breach includes:
- Lateral movement attacks – When attackers use compromised access at a vendor, supplier,
or partner to infiltrate the networks of their business-to-business (B2B) customers or other
partners.
- Vendor data breaches – When data from one organization is compromised while in the
custody of a vendor, supplier, or service provider.

Security teams can no longer afford to treat third-party security as a compliance checkbox. Traditional
vendor risk assessments—conducted annually or quarterly—are too slow to detect active threats.
While you’re scheduling your next quarterly assessment, attackers are already three vendors deep into
your supply chain.

This report will demonstrate why leading organizations are shifting from reactive third-party risk
management to real-time supply chain threat detection. The future of cybersecurity depends on
protecting your network and your entire ecosystem.

## Top Takeaways

### The Rising Tide of Third-Party
Breaches

35.5% of all breaches in 2024 were third-
party related, a 6.5% increase from 2023. This
number is likely conservative, as many third-
party breaches go unreported or are mistakenly
assumed to be internal incidents. It’s like playing
“Spot the Breach Origin”—harder than you’d think
and nobody wins.

### Industries at Highest Risk

Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, and Biotechnology
had the highest volume of third-party breaches.
However, this is largely due to high overall
breach numbers and strict U.S. breach disclosure
requirements.

Retail, Hospitality, and Consumer Goods, along
with Technology, Telecommunications, and
Media, experienced the highest relative third-
party breach rates. These industries had a higher
proportion of third-party breaches compared to
their total breach volume.

Energy, Utilities, and Critical Infrastructure had
a disproportionately high rate of third-party
breaches despite its smaller share of overall
breaches. This aligns with prior research
indicating that critical infrastructure is highly
vulnerable to third-party risks.

### Geopolitical & Regional Trends

North America accounted for 59% of total
breaches but only 53% of third-party breaches.
The U.S. sees a high volume of breaches in
general, but many of them are direct attacks,
particularly in healthcare.

Europe, Northeast Asia, and Oceania exhibited
higher relative rates of third-party breaches.
Japan consistently records some of the highest
third-party breach rates, while the Netherlands
led in 2024 due to a single large breach at a
customer communications firm that impacted
multiple utilities and housing associations.

Chinese state-sponsored groups continue to
use third-party attack vectors in supply chain
compromises, particularly targeting Asian and
Western organizations. The Philippines also had
a surprisingly high number of breaches in our
dataset, particularly third-party breaches, due
to its importance as a target of Chinese cyber
espionage.

### Attackers & Threat Vectors

Chinese cyber espionage actors frequently use
third-party attack vectors, particularly in regional
supply chain compromises.

The ransomware group C10p remains the most
prolific third-party attacker, leveraging file
transfer software vulnerabilities to breach multiple
organizations at once.

RansomHub is emerging as the most dominant
non-C10p ransomware group, likely filling the
vacuum left by AlphV/BlackCat’s disbanding and
law enforcement actions against LockBit.

UNC5537’s campaign against Snowflake cloud
services significantly contributed to cloud
platforms becoming the second most common
third-party attack vector in 2024.

### Third-Party Breaches &
Ransomware: A Growing Nexus

41.4% of ransomware and extortion incidents had
a third-party breach component, indicating an
increasing reliance on supply chain infiltration.

C10p’s large-scale exploitation of Cleo
vulnerabilities dwarfed all other known third-party
exploits, reinforcing its reputation as the most
prolific third-party attacker.

### The Role of Technology in Third-
Party Breaches

46.75% of third-party breaches involved
technology products and services, a significant
drop from last year’s 75%, signaling a
diversification of attack surfaces.

File transfer software remained the top third-
party breach enabler, with C10p exploiting
vulnerabilities in Cleo software (CVE-2024-
50623 & CVE-2024-55956) to launch large-scale
attacks.

Cross-industry technology was four times more
commonly exploited than industry-specific
technology, reflecting the broad reach of supply
chain risks. Despite this, products & services
specific to Healthcare and Financial Services
(both technical and non-technical) together
accounted for 27.5% of third-party breach origins,
nearly the same as last year.

### The Affluence Factor

A correlation is emerging between economic
development and third-party breach frequency.
Wealthier nations experience more third-party
attacks due to their interconnected supply chains
and higher security standards, which drive
attackers toward indirect access points.

Affluent countries such as Singapore, the
Netherlands, and Japan had among the highest
third-party breach rates. In contrast, China,
Brazil, and Russia—despite high overall breach
numbers—saw fewer third-party breaches,
likely due to different attack patterns and fewer
business-to-business dependencies.

## Third-Party vs. Fourth-Party
Breach Trends

### The Expanding Risk Chain

Supply chain attacks are increasing as hackers
exploit the weakest links in security. As
organizations strengthen their internal defenses,
attackers bypass them by targeting less secure
vendors, suppliers, and service providers.

Our analysis of 1,000 breaches highlights the
growing risks in third-party and fourth-party
breaches.

### Third-Party Breaches Are Rising
Fast

- 35.5% of breaches (355 cases) involved a
third-party nexus, up from 29% last year,
marking a 6.5% increase.
- Attackers are increasingly exploiting third-
party access to evade strong internal
security measures.
- The rise in outsourcing, interdependence,
and cloud reliance has created more
opportunities for attackers to leverage
third-party weaknesses.

### Fourth-Party Breaches Create
Cascading Failures

- 45 breaches extended beyond third parties
to involve yet another organization in the
supply chain.
- These fourth-party breaches accounted
for 4.5% of all breaches and 12.7% of third-
party breaches.
- The interconnected nature of modern
business ecosystems means that a single
compromise can trigger widespread
disruptions across multiple organizations.

### The Hidden Iceberg: Underreported
Third-Party Risks

- The true scale of third-party and fourth-
party breaches is likely higher than
reported. For example a global food retailer
reports that 67% of breaches were caused
by third-parties.
- Many breach reports lack details on the
attack vectors, tactics, and stolen data,
making it difficult to identify third-party
involvement.
- The complexity of modern supply chains
means that many third-party connections
remain invisible until they are exploited.

As businesses become more interconnected,
the attack surface continues to expand. In the
next section, we examine which industries,
regions, and countries are facing the greatest
third-party risks.

## Distribution of Third-Party
Breaches by Industry

### Understanding the Three Key Metrics

We examined third-party breach risk through three different but complementary lenses. Here’s
what each measurement tells us:

1.  **Total Breach Count by Industry**
    This shows which industries experience the most breaches overall:
    1.  Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, and Biotechnology: 242 breaches
        (24.2%)
    2.  Government, Defense, and Aerospace: 132 breaches (13.2%)
    3.  Financial Services, Insurance, and Real Estate: 119 breaches
        (11.9%)
    4.  Technology, Telecommunications, and Media/Entertainment: 110
        breaches (11%)
    5.  Retail, Hospitality, and Consumer Goods: 103 breaches (10.3%)
    6.  Education: 82 breaches (8.2%)
    7.  Manufacturing, Automotive, and Construction: 69 breaches
        (6.9%)
    8.  Travel, Transportation, and Logistics: 64 breaches (6.4%)
    9.  Professional & Business Services: 49 breaches (4.9%)
    10. Energy, Utilities, and Critical Infrastructure: 30 breaches (3%)

    ![Bar chart showing total breach count by industry](https://www.securityscorecard.com/resource/global-third-party-breach-report/images/distribution-of-breaches-by-industry-total-breaches.png)

2.  **Third-Party Breach Count by Industry**
    This shows which industries experience the most breaches specifically
    through third parties:
    1.  Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, and Biotechnology: 78 breaches
        (22%)
    2.  Retail, Hospitality, and Consumer Goods: 54 breaches (15.2%)
    3.  Technology, Telecommunications, and Media/Entertainment: 52
        breaches (14.6%)
    4.  Financial Services, Insurance, and Real Estate: 40 breaches (11.3%)
    5.  Government, Defense, and Aerospace: 39 breaches (11%)
    6.  Travel, Transportation, and Logistics: 29 breaches (8.2%)
    7.  Manufacturing, Automotive, and Construction: 25 breaches (7.1%)
    8.  Professional & Business Services: 15 breaches (4.2%)
    9.  Energy, Utilities, and Critical Infrastructure: 14 breaches (3.9%)
    10. Education: 9 breaches (2.5%)

    ![Bar chart showing third-party breach count by industry](https://www.securityscorecard.com/resource/global-third-party-breach-report/images/distribution-of-breaches-by-industry-third-party-breaches.png)

3.  **Third-Party Breach Rate Within Each Industry**
    This reveals what percentage of each industry’s breaches come through third parties:
    - Retail, Hospitality, and Consumer Goods: 52.4%
    - Technology, Telecommunications, and Media/Entertainment: 47.3%
    - Energy, Utilities, and Critical Infrastructure: 46.7%
    - Travel, Transportation, and Logistics: 45.3%
    - Manufacturing, Automotive, and Construction: 36.2%
    - Cross-Industry & Worldwide Average: 35.5%
    - Financial Services, Insurance, and Real Estate: 33.6%
    - Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, and Biotechnology: 32.2%
    - Professional & Business Services: 30.6%
    - Government, Defense, and Aerospace: 29.5%
    - Education: 11.0%

    ![Bar chart showing third-party breach rate by industry](https://www.securityscorecard.com/resource/global-third-party-breach-report/images/distribution-of-breaches-by-industry-third-party-rate.png)

### Why These Distinctions Matter
- Healthcare has the most third-party breaches by
    count (78), but a below-average rate (32.2%)
- Retail has fewer total breaches than Healthcare
    (103 vs. 242), but over half (52.4%) involve third
    parties
- Education has both few third-party breaches (9)
    and the lowest rate (11%)

### The Bottom Line

Looking at just breach counts can be
misleading. What matters is understanding
both total breaches and the percentage
coming through third parties:
- Retail leads with over half (52.4%) of breaches
    from third parties
- Healthcare has the most breaches overall but a
    below-average third-party rate (32.2%)
- All industries should prioritize supply chain
    security, but those with high third-party rates face
    proportionally greater risk through their vendor
    ecosystem

## ATTACK PATTERNS

### Healthcare Tops Breaches
in General

Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, and Biotechnology dominates the breach landscape with the highest
number of incidents in both overall breaches and third-party breaches. However, a closer look reveals
an important pattern in how these breaches occur:

### Key Statistics Explained:
- Healthcare accounts for 78 third-party breaches (22%
    of all third-party breaches) - this is the highest raw
    number among all industries
- However, looking at the proportion within healthcare
    itself, only 32.2% of its breaches involve third parties
    (compared to 35.5% across all industries)
- In other words: Out of healthcare’s 242 total breaches,
    only 78 (32.2%) came through third parties
- This means healthcare faces more direct attacks than
    attacks through its vendor ecosystem compared to the
    cross-industry average

### Why This Matters

Healthcare suffers from the most breaches overall
(242 incidents, 24.2% of all breaches), but a smaller
percentage of these breaches involve third parties than the
cross-industry average. This isn’t due to greater resilience
against third-party attacks, but rather reflects the sheer
volume of direct attacks targeting healthcare organizations.
The prevalence of straightforward patient data breaches
from U.S. providers with no third-party involvement supports
this pattern, suggesting attackers are finding direct routes
into healthcare systems without needing to leverage vendor
relationships.

### Multiple Factors Drive Healthcare’s
High Breach Volume
Several key factors contribute to healthcare’s position at the
top of the breach statistics:
- Perceived weaker security makes healthcare a soft
    target for attackers
- Lower downtime tolerance makes healthcare
    particularly vulnerable to ransomware attacks
- Healthcare records contain rich personal data, making
    them highly valuable to attackers
- U.S. breach disclosure laws may artificially inflate
    healthcare’s breach numbers compared to other
    sectors

### The Direct Attack Pattern

The data suggests that attackers often find direct routes
into healthcare systems more viable than going through
their suppliers or partners. This observed pattern indicates
that when a target’s direct defenses present sufficient
vulnerabilities, attackers may not need to resort to the
often more complex approach of compromising third-party
relationships.

2025 SecurityScorecard Global Third-Party Breach Report | 11

## Retail & Hospitality
and Technology &
Telecommunications Lead in
Third-Party Breach Exposure

Two industries stand out in our analysis with high third-party breach rates and notable
increases in their representation among third-party incidents:

### Retail & Hospitality: The Most
Vulnerable Industry

- The only industry with a third-party breach majority:
    52.4% of all its breaches involve third parties
- Ranks fifth in overall breaches but jumps to second
    place for third-party breaches
- Substantial increase in share from 10.3% of all
    breaches to 15.2% of third-party breaches

### Technology & Telecommunications:
Close Second

- 47.3% of breaches involve third parties
- Moves from fourth place overall to third place for third-
    party breaches
- Share increases from 11% of all breaches to 14.6% of
    third-party breaches

### The Big Three Dominate

- Together with Healthcare, these three industries
    account for 51.8% of all third-party breaches
- Our Japan-specific study (the country with the highest
    third-party breach rate) also identified Technology and
    Retail & Hospitality as particularly vulnerable within
    that market

### Why Retail & Hospitality Is So
Vulnerable

- Historically targeted for payment card data
- Card breaches inherently involve third parties (banks
    that issue cards and bear fraud-related losses)
- Modern e-commerce platforms rely heavily on third-party
    vendors:
    - Hosting companies
    - Software developers
    - Specialized e-commerce service providers
- Compromises at technology vendors can create
    cascading breaches (fourth-party)

### The Technology Sector’s Unique
Risk Profile

- SecurityScorecard research confirms technology
    companies face among the highest third-party risks
- They occupy a dual position: both enabling third-party
    attacks on customers and suffering attacks via their
    own vendors
- Typically maintain larger, more complex attack
    surfaces
- This complexity creates additional challenges for both
    attackers and defenders
- Last year’s report highlighted Healthcare and
    Technology as top third-party targets

This distribution is consistent with our
previous findings

2025 SecurityScorecard Global Third-Party Breach Report | 12

## Energy and Transportation
Sectors Show Alarming
Third-Party Breach Rates

For each of the 150 insurance companies, we identified their lowest sub-scoring security
factor out of 10 possible categories. These factors contribute to their overall scores.

### Energy, Utilities, and Critical Infrastructure

HIDDEN HIGH RISK
- Third-highest frequency of third-party breaches at 46.7% (14 of 30 breaches)
- Represents just 3% of all breaches but faces disproportionate third-party risk
- Consistent with SecurityScorecard’s previous analysis of the U.S. energy supply chain
- U.S. energy sector showed similar patterns with 45% of breaches having third-party connections
- Global energy sector appears to follow similar vulnerability patterns as observed in the U.S.

### Travel, Transportation, and Logistics

FOURTH MOST VULNERABLE
- Fourth-highest third-party breach rate at 45.3%
- Share of third-party breaches (8.2%) exceeds its share of total breaches (6.4%)
- Elevated risk largely attributed to a targeted campaign by a prolific threat actor
- The C10p ransomware group specifically targeted this industry
- C10p’s history of exploiting software vulnerabilities aligns with third-party attack vectors
- This concentrated campaign was significant enough to skew industry-wide statistics

More details on this specific campaign are covered in later sections of the report

These findings highlight how even industries with relatively fewer total breaches can face significant
supply chain security challenges, with nearly half of all incidents originating through third parties.

### The Concentration Effect
- While 12 countries accounted for 88.4% of all breaches, just 11 countries account for 91.9% of all third-party
    breaches globally
- Country-level third-party breach rates show even more dramatic variation than regional rates
- Smaller but economically advanced nations face disproportionately high third-party breach risks

### Notable National Findings
- Singapore: Highest third-party breach rate (71.4%) despite relatively few total breaches
- Netherlands: Second highest rate (70.4%), influenced by a major breach at a communications firm affecting multiple
    utilities
- Japan: Third highest rate (60%), continuing a pattern identified in previous reports
- Taiwan: 57.1% third-party breach rate despite few total breaches
- Singapore’s high rate (71.4%) appears in our data alongside documented Chinese cyber operations

## Geopolitical Patterns

### Supply Chain Attack Trends

#### The East Asian Trends
- Japan’s persistently high third-party breach rate (60%) relates to two factors:
    - Complex subsidiary structures of Japanese multinational corporations
    - Targeted Chinese state-sponsored attacks using third-party vectors
- Taiwan’s high third-party breach rate (57.1%) correlates with its status as a focus of Chinese cyber espionage
- Singapore’s high rate (71.4%) appears in our data alongside documented Chinese cyber operations

#### The China Connection
Singapore made our top countries list for third-party breaches while missing the general breach list entirely. With its
significant overseas Chinese population and strategic position in China’s economic and naval power projection, it’s a prime
target. Though we should note Singapore’s smaller breach sample size might be inflating that eye-popping 71.4% rate.

The Philippines stands out as the oddball on both lists—seventh for general breaches and eighth for third-party breaches.
Unlike its list companions, it’s neither a major geopolitical power nor an economic heavyweight. This developing nation
earned its spot through Chinese cyber campaigns tied to maritime territorial disputes. For example, Chinese state-sponsored
actors compromised a cloud provider to access six Filipino government domains, including the Coast Guard and National
Coastal Watch System.

Australia faces similar Chinese cyber attention, but that doesn’t fully explain Oceania’s elevated third-party breach numbers.
Similarly, the U.K. and Germany’s higher breach rates don’t account for Europe’s above-average third-party statistics. The
Netherlands, however, gives us a clearer picture with its 5.4% share and 70.4% third-party breach rate (highest in our
sample). One large-scale breach at a Dutch customer communications firm cascaded through Dutch water companies/
authorities, utilities, and housing associations.

#### North American Nuances
The U.S. posts a lower third-party breach rate (30.9%)—4.6% below the global average. This stems primarily from America’s
high volume of direct healthcare breaches and stricter disclosure laws, which inflate the overall breach count and make third-
party incidents appear less significant by comparison. The U.S. breach volume effectively dilutes global third-party statistics,
masking substantive supply chain issues.

Canada’s elevated third-party breach profile lacks a single explanation. We theorize that the higher third-party breach rates
across Canada, Australia, and major European economies may simply represent the “new normal” for Western democracies
with advanced economies.

### Research Reality Check
- We recognize potential sampling bias toward English-speaking countries, especially the U.S., and have worked to
    counter this by incorporating more non-English sources and broadening international coverage.
- Singapore’s impressive-looking 71.4% third-party breach rate deserves some skepticism given its smaller sample
    size—a reminder that percentages without context can mislead even seasoned analysts.

## The Wealth Effect

### Economic Prosperity Correlates with Third-Party Breach Risk

A counterintuitive pattern – wealthier nations face significantly higher third-party breach risks.
This finding builds on our previous research establishing that organizations in more affluent
countries typically have stronger security postures.

### The Wealth-Risk Paradox
Previous SecurityScorecard research established that
organizations in wealthier countries generally maintain
stronger security than those in developing economies.
Paradoxically, our current analysis suggests these same
affluent nations face disproportionately high third-party
breach risks:

- Less affluent economies show declining
    representation in third-party breaches:
    - China, Brazil, and Russia appear among countries
        with the highest shares of breaches overall
    - Yet all three disappear from the list of countries
        with the highest shares of third-party breaches
- Affluent economies show increased representation in
    third-party breaches:
    - The much smaller but more affluent “Asian Tigers”
        of Taiwan and Singapore replace those less affluent
        nations on the third-party breach leaderboard
    - Nearly all countries with the largest shares of third-
        party breaches are economically advanced nations

### The Exceptions That Prove the Rule
Only three countries on our third-party breach leaderboard
show below-average third
