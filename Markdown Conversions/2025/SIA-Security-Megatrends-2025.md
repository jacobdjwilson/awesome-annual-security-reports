- [HOT TAKE “I object to the term ‘artificial intelligence’ because it’s anything but. AI stands for ‘absolute ignorance,’ and the problem with using that term [AI] is we tend to anthropomorphize it. The things that humans do well – computers struggle with them. I like IA instead—‘intelligent automation’ —where you put a human in the loop to provide the judgment and creativity and let the computer do the heavy lifting. Tech can do a good job selecting candidates for the guard industry, but it also overlooks good candidates. There are losses of information, and the current technology we have can’t go beyond a line of knowledge. Humans can, but the tech we have today cannot. AI isn’t a description of the tech – it’s a description of the people using it. It makes people artificially more intelligent. If we rely on their decision making and the computer presents them with an option they don’t understand and they say ‘yes,’ it could be they’re signing on to something that’s contrary to what they wanted but they don’t know it. It’s a statistical inference engine, and ‘There’s lies, there’s damn lies and there’s statistic inference engines.’” – PIERRE RACZ, CEO, GENETEC, SPEAKING AT SNG 2024](#hot-take-i-object-to-the-term-artificial-intelligence-because-its-anything-but-ai-stands-for-absolute-ignorance-and-the-problem-with-using-that-term-ai-is-we-tend-to-anthropomorphize-it-the-things-that-humans-do-well--computers-struggle-with-them-i-like-ia-instead-intelligent-automation-where-you-put-a-human-in-the-loop-to-provide-the-judgment-and-creativity-and-let-the-computer-do-the-heavy-lifting-tech-can-do-a-good-job-selecting-candidates-for-the-guard-industry-but-it-also-overlooks-good-candidates-there-are-losses-of-information-and-the-current-technology-we-have-cant-go-beyond-a-line-of-knowledge-humans-can-but-the-tech-we-have-today-cannot-ai-isnt-a-description-of-the-tech--its-a-description-of-the-people-using-it-it-makes-people-artificially-more-intelligent-if-we-rely-on-their-decision-making-and-the-computer-presents-them-with-an-option-they-dont-understand-and-they-say-yes-it-could-be-theyre-signing-on-to-something-thats-contrary-to-what-they-wanted-but-they-dont-know-it-its-a-statistical-inference-engine-and-theres-lies-theres-damn-lies-and-theres-statistic-inference-engines-pierre-racz-ceo-genetec-speaking-at-sng-2024)

- [PERSPECTIVE](#perspective)
- [HOT TAKE The SIA Mobile Credentials event at ISC East 2024 highlighted a crucial distinction in our industry: the difference between proliferation and democratization. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they represent fundamentally different trajectories for identity management. “What we’re witnessing today is proliferation—a widespread increase in identity-based systems and their adoption. However, what our industry desperately needs is democratization—the process of making identity accessible and equitable to a broader audience by reducing costs, complexity and exclusivity. The current landscape remains expensive, complex and restricted to those who are either integrated into existing ecosystems or, in Big Tech’s case, granted permission to participate. We’re experiencing a fascinating return to our roots in identity management and access control. While mobile credentials may seem revolutionary, they’re not entirely new. From 1973 to 1983, the industry utilized the TRW System, which featured a built-in call to a centralized identity check system focused on the person. Then, from 1983 onwards, our focus shifted primarily to the door when TRW spun the system out and Basix was born. Now, we’re essentially coming full circle, returning to person-centric solutions with modern technology. The most significant shift is in not the technology itself but how identity and our preferred modalities have evolved. While mobile wallets have proven transformative—revolutionizing credential storage and elevating access control to mainstream levels and our industry’s first ‘luxury good’—the real winner may be an unexpected bystander: biometrics. As identity-based systems continue their rise across sectors, biometric authentication is quietly positioning itself nicely. Few would have predicted when this journey began that the best marketing for a group that can’t seem to break through, would be wallets and near field communication. That said, the true winner in all of this digital transformation is the customer because they now have the choice of modality, experience and level of assurance desired. But again the true question with all this change is: Can we bridge the gap between proliferation and true democratization, making secure identity solutions accessible to all while maintaining the momentum we’ve achieved?” – LEE ODESS, CEO, ACCESS CONTROL EXECUTIVE BRIEF](#hot-take-the-sia-mobile-credentials-event-at-isc-east-2024-highlighted-a-crucial-distinction-in-our-industry-the-difference-between-proliferation-and-democratization-while-these-terms-are-often-used-interchangeably-they-represent-fundamentally-different-trajectories-for-identity-management-what-were-witnessing-today-is-proliferationa-widespread-increase-in-identity-based-systems-and-their-adoption-however-what-our-industry-desperately-needs-is-democratizationthe-process-of-making-identity-accessible-and-equitable-to-a-broader-audience-by-reducing-costs-complexity-and-exclusivity-the-current-landscape-remains-expensive-complex-and-restricted-to-those-who-are-either-integrated-into-existing-ecosystems-or-in-big-techs-case-granted-permission-to-participate-were-experiencing-a-fascinating-return-to-our-roots-in-identity-management-and-access-control-while-mobile-credentials-may-seem-revolutionary-theyre-not-entirely-new-from-1973-to-1983-the-industry-utilized-the-trw-system-which-featured-a-built-in-call-to-a-centralized-identity-check-system-focused-on-the-person-then-from-1983-onwards-our-focus-shifted-primarily-to-the-door-when-trw-spun-the-system-out-and-basix-was-born-now-were-essentially-coming-full-circle-returning-to-person-centric-solutions-with-modern-technology-the-most-significant-shift-is-in-not-the-technology-itself-but-how-identity-and-our-preferred-modalities-have-evolved-while-mobile-wallets-have-proven-transformativerevolutionizing-credential-storage-and-elevating-access-control-to-mainstream-levels-and-our-industrys-first-luxury-goodthe-real-winner-may-be-an-unexpected-bystander-biometrics-as-identity-based-systems-continue-their-rise-across-sectors-biometric-authentication-is-quietly-positioning-itself-nicely-few-would-have-predicted-when-this-journey-began-that-the-best-marketing-for-a-group-that-cant-seem-to-break-through-would-be-wallets-and-near-field-communication-that-said-the-true-winner-in-all-of-this-digital-transformation-is-the-customer-because-they-now-have-the-choice-of-modality-experience-and-level-of-assurance-desired-but-again-the-true-question-with-all-this-change-is-can-we-bridge-the-gap-between-proliferation-and-true-democratization-making-secure-identity-solutions-accessible-to-all-while-maintaining-the-momentum-weve-achieved-lee-odess-ceo-access-control-executive-brief)

## 2025 SECURITY MEGATRENDS™
## SECURING THE CHANNEL

At SIA, our mission is to be a catalyst for success in the global security industry.

We serve the business community of our industry. At our core are the individuals and companies that develop, produce, install, integrate, design, specify, monitor and operate the products, solutions and services that keep our world safe.

Our member companies and their employees are our foundation, and to help keep our industry on the forefront of security, we endeavor to produce research and trends analysis that gives our members an edge and an eye to the future.

Our annual Security Megatrends report, first published with the 2017 report, and now in its ninth year with this 2025 report, is part of that commitment to keep you prepared for the future.

The future isn’t always predictable, but it’s always exciting. Artificial intelligence has burst upon our industry in recent years and holds great promise for our industry’s future. We have watched as operational technology (OT) converges with information technology (IT) and simultaneously with all aspects of security—physical and cyber. These profound changes call upon us to adapt and to realign our industry to the needs of the modern business world.

Another area of rapid evolution we see today is the changes in technology and in business and delivery models that systems integration businesses face. Integrators are the second largest core of our membership, just after the technology solution producers (product manufacturers and software firms). The amount of upheaval facing today’s integrators is profound. Technology producers are delivering more advanced solutions than the integrator has ever seen. The integrators are no longer connecting isolated solutions, but are delivering networked solutions that are fundamental to the end users’ businesses, and must be competent in not only traditional security and safety requirements, but now are expected to interface those systems with other IT and OT systems, and must do so in a way that matches the customer’s IT requirements and cyber security.

Simultaneously, today’s systems integrator must ensure those systems are not only improving the organization’s security but are providing business insights that transcend core security and safety needs – and they must do this while navigating business model changes that see more and more direct-to-customer sales, software-as-a-service and managed services revenue models that are unlike what they worked with even 5 or 10 years ago.

This year’s Megatrends report ranks that “Evolution of the Channel” as the No. 1 trend facing the business of security, a theme that was heard repeatedly at the 2024 Securing New Ground conference and in the surveys and focus group calls that powered this year’s report. The top ranking and deep focus we have put on this trend is not only seen in this year’s Security Megatrends report, but in our early 2024 report “The Evolving Security Industry: The Adaptation of the Systems Integrator,” along with our continued focus in providing online and in-person education and certification for integrators that ranges from our Security Industry Cybersecurity Certification (SICC), our Security Project Management training and certification programs, our Cornerstones modules for onboarding new employees, our GrantED training program to help integrators unlock grant opportunities for their clients, and various technical and business skill programs offered through our e-learning platform SIAcademy.

We remain committed to assisting our integrator members as they adapt and we believe that a vibrant channel is essential to the industry’s overall health and to the business performance of ALL our members, including our SPARC community of corporate security leaders.

Special Thanks: We want to thank all our members who took time to participate in the annual survey, attend the Megatrends sessions at SNG, guest contributors and especially our advisory boards who served as focus groups. We also thank our SNG speakers, from whom many of these insights are drawn. We thank you for allowing us to help serve you and be a catalyst for your success!.

Sincerely,
Scott Dunn
Chair, SIA Board of Directors
