## 01 Executive Summary

The integration of AI agents into websites and applications is accelerating, reshaping how businesses operate and how users interact with digital services. From chatbots and recommendation engines to automation bots - agentic AI has gone mainstream. More than half of organizations already using agentic AI say they’re deploying it, or planning to, for customer interactions. On the consumer side, 64% report encountering AI chatbots more frequently than a year ago, and four out of five say they’ve shared personal details during these interactions.

But here’s the problem: **trust hasn’t kept pace with adoption.**

Half of consumers say they feel uncomfortable inputting personal information into a chatbot, and 44% have felt pressured to do so just to complete a task. This gap between usage and trust raises a key question: How can organizations harness the benefits of agentic AI while respecting - and earning - the trust of the consumers they serve?

What’s often overlooked is that this AI revolution is powered by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that form the connective fabric of the AI ecosystem, enabling agents to retrieve information, trigger actions, and communicate seamlessly between systems. As agentic AI spreads, so too do the risks. While consumers notice the growing presence of AI and increasingly engage with it, concerns about security loom large. In fact, 62% believe chatbots are more vulnerable to manipulation by hackers than their human counterparts.

This report[^1] explores the evolving architecture of AI agents, how both consumers and organizations are engaging with them, and the critical role APIs play in enabling their capabilities. It also examines the security challenges posed by this rapid evolution and offers best practices to help organizations protect their APIs, maintain consumer trust, and ensure the safe future of agentic AI.

## 02 Introduction

AI agents are software-driven entities designed to simulate intelligent behavior in tasks like customer service, content generation, and business automation.

Common examples include:

*   Chatbots and virtual assistants
*   Recommendation engines
*   Task automation bots

These agents rely heavily on APIs to access internal databases, third-party services, and company systems, which enable them to function efficiently and dynamically. For example, a chatbot may use APIs to access a customer’s order history or to initiate a return request.

Almost two-thirds (**64%**) of consumers noted an uptick in how much they encountered AI agents compared with the previous year and **81%** of those who had encountered an AI chatbot said they entered personal details into it.

From a business perspective, the scope of AI operations is broad with nearly half (**48%**) of organizations that use agentic AI currently employing between 6 and 20 types of AI agents and **19%** deploying between 21 and 50. A significant **37%** of organizations report that 1–100 AI agents are currently active within their systems, while almost a fifth (**18%**) host between 501–1000 agents.

Businesses are using or planning to use agentic AI in a wide range of applications, from content creation and data analysis to customer interactions, fraud detection, supply chain optimization, and even internal process automation. As adoption deepens, agentic AI is increasingly embedded into core business functions, driving both efficiency and innovation.

### What is the Value Proposition of AI agents?

Businesses are turning to AI agents to gain a competitive edge. These agents offer more than just automation, they enable round-the-clock service availability, _hyper-personalized user experiences_, and scalable operations that can adapt in real time to customer needs. By handling routine tasks and streamlining complex workflows, AI agents reduce operational costs while freeing up human teams to focus on higher-value activities.

But this value comes with a caveat: the growing reliance on APIs which power these AI capabilities also introduces new security challenges. As AI agents interact with sensitive data, initiate transactions, and make autonomous decisions, the infrastructure that supports them must be not only high-performing, but also resilient, secure, and trustworthy. Ensuring API integrity is no longer just a technical concern, it's a foundational requirement for protecting business value and maintaining consumer trust.

This disparity emphasizes a persistent trust gap between humans and machines, particularly when sensitive data is involved.

### What Public Skepticism and Trust Issues are There?

Consumers still prefer human interaction for personal data sharing. Despite the growing presence and capabilities of AI agents, human interaction remains the preferred channel when it comes to sharing personal information. While **54%** of consumers are comfortable disclosing personal details in-person and **37%** by phone, only **22%** feel comfortable doing so through a chatbot. This disparity underscores a persistent trust gap between humans and machines, particularly when sensitive data is involved.

The data also reveals a deeper tension: convenience often trumps caution. Nearly half (**44%**) of users admit to feeling pressured into providing personal information to chatbots, often just to complete a transaction or access a service. This suggests that while consumers may be wary of AI, they frequently go along with the interaction out of necessity, not confidence.

This dynamic has serious implications. It points to a fragile trust ecosystem in which users may comply with AI systems under duress or frustration, rather than feeling secure and in control. For organizations, this highlights the importance of designing transparent, ethical, and secure AI experiences, not only to meet user expectations but to avoid a long-term erosion of trust.

## 03 The Role of APIs in AI Agent Functionality

> "APIs allow AI agents to take action within enterprise platforms such as CRMs, ERPs, or e-commerce systems triggering workflows like updating records, generating invoices, or processing returns."

APIs enable AI agents to access structured data from both internal systems and external services. For example, an AI-powered customer support agent might use APIs to retrieve a customer’s purchase history from a backend database in real time, allowing it to provide more relevant and informed responses. Similarly, APIs allow AI agents to take action within enterprise platforms such as CRMs, ERPs, or e-commerce systems triggering workflows like updating records, generating invoices, or processing returns.

Beyond simple data retrieval or task execution, APIs also allow AI agents to orchestrate complex, multi-step processes. Consider a logistics bot that coordinates a delivery: it may check warehouse inventory, schedule a pickup with a shipping carrier via their API, and send a confirmation to the customer - all without human intervention. In the financial sector, an AI advisor might pull real-time market data from third-party APIs, analyze the results, and generate investment recommendations tailored to an individual’s portfolio. Each API serves as a _“bridge,”_ enabling the AI to function intelligently and autonomously.

In essence, APIs transform AI agents from isolated algorithms into powerful digital collaborators capable of navigating and acting within interconnected systems. This deep integration is what gives agentic AI its utility, but it also highlights why securing those APIs is so critical. If the interfaces that fuel AI are vulnerable, the agents themselves become liabilities rather than assets.

## 04 API Security Challenges in the Context of AI Agents

As AI agents become more embedded across digital systems, they dramatically increase the number of API interactions occurring within and between platforms. This proliferation creates a vastly expanded attack surface, as each new API connection introduces a potential entry point for threat actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional applications, AI agents often operate autonomously and at scale, amplifying the impact of any single security lapse.

One of the key challenges lies in authentication and privilege management. AI agents frequently require access to multiple systems and datasets, and are often granted elevated permissions to perform their functions efficiently. However, if their credentials are compromised, whether through phishing, poor storage practices, or insecure token handling, the consequences can be severe.

> "A single set of stolen credentials could enable an attacker to access sensitive data, execute fraudulent transactions, or manipulate business operations without immediate detection."

Another emerging risk is the potential for _prompt injection attacks_, where malicious inputs are crafted to manipulate the AI’s behavior or bypass safety controls. When these inputs are processed through APIs that feed data directly into agent workflows, the danger increases, especially if input validation and sanitization are inadequate.

Monitoring and detection also become significantly more complex in environments where AI agents generate a high volume of API traffic. Distinguishing “normal” behavior from anomalies is far more challenging when millions of requests are processed dynamically, especially when those patterns evolve in real time. Traditional security tools may struggle to keep pace without adaptive, AI-driven monitoring solutions.

Additionally, APIs are frequently the weakest link in otherwise secure environments. Poorly configured endpoints, insufficient access controls, lack of input validation, and vulnerabilities in third-party APIs all present opportunities for exploitation. Even with strong perimeter defenses, an overlooked API can provide a direct pathway
