The  State
of Container Security2025Executive summary The container ecosystem has matured significantly over the past decade,
yet fundamental questions about security practices remain unresolved.how organizations select and build container images,
which security practices they follow,
what challenges they encounter, and
where current practices fall short of their stated priorities.To better understand how teams manage container security today,
we surveyed 427 professionals at Devoxx 2025 to examine:Across the responses, a clear pattern emerges: teams overwhelmingly value security, efficiency, and simplicity — yet their tools, OS choices, and JVMs directly undermine these goals.2The 2025 State of Container SecurityKey Findings23%3experienced container-related security incidents in the past year33%update monthly or less frequently. Meanwhile, exploitation windows have shrunk from weeks to days.48%want pre-hardened base images, indicating a shift toward outsourcing vulnerability management.49%vscite time and resource constraints as a primary challenge in maintaining container securityTeams know what good security looks like, but current tooling, OS choices, and JDKs
make it difficult to achieve without external support.29% of respondents prioritize security (minimal number of CVEs) when selecting base container images.55% use general-purpose Linux distributions with hundreds of unnecessary packages and unresolved CVEs. 2/3 of respondents want efficiency for Java applications in containers, measured by low memory usage, high throughput, and fast startup time. 69% use general-purpose JDKs requiring manual optimization, consuming engineering time and inflating cloud bills.The 2025 State of Container SecuritySecurity Leads, but Priorities Pull in Different Directions4Security dominates at 29%, followed by performance at 21%, image size
at 17%, and Java support at 17%. This split reveals the challenge: teams manage multiple concerns simultaneously.Image size and memory efficiency directly impact cloud spending. Smaller containers mean lower storage costs, faster deployments, and reduced bandwidth. With hundreds or thousands of instances running, these differences compound quickly.Java applications complicate this further. General-purpose JDKs weren't built for containers. Organizations either invest significant engineering
time in manual tuning or accept higher cloud bills. Solutions like Liberica JDK Lite deliver 30% reduction in memory and disk space without complex configuration.What is the most important factor for you when choosing a base container image?Other1%4%License compliance11%Ease of use21%Performance17%Java support17%Image size29%Security (minimal number of CVEs)The 2025 State of Container SecurityPerformance

Only 17% use minimal/distroless images in production.Organizations face a real conflict: operational convenience during development vs. minimal attack surface in production.A practical approach is using hardened minimal runtime images, paired with fuller “debug builds” during development—allowing both security and diagnostics without compromise.Which of the following do you find essential inside the base container?binutils, coreutils 14%17%none of the above,

Face Support Gaps7The split is revealing: 41% use Alpine while 55% use Ubuntu/Debian or Red Hat-based systems. This represents fundamentally different approaches.Ubuntu/Debian and Red Hat users rely on general-purpose distributions with hundreds of packages their applications never use. Each represents potential vulnerabilities requiring security patches. When a vulnerability emerges, security teams must evaluate impact and coordinate updates across thousands of instances—regardless of whether the application
uses the affected package.Alpine Linux users chose minimal distributions built for containers, reducing image size and vulnerability exposure. However, Alpine is community-driven with no commercial support, no SLAs, and no Long-Term Support releases. For enterprises under regulatory frameworks, this creates compliance concerns.Alpaquita Linux addresses this gap—delivering minimal attack surface with enterprise-grade support guarantees.Alpine Linux41%Ubuntu/Debian34%Red Hat/Red Hat-based distributions (Rocky, AlmaLinux, CentOS)21%Alpaquita Linux2%other distributions1%55%of respondents report using bloated general-purpose Linux distributionsBase Operating Systems: The 2025 State of Container SecurityMainstream JDKs Carry

Cost Burdens8Over 69% use Oracle/OpenJDK or Adoptium/Temurin—mainstream distributions aligned with what developers know. This familiarity has hidden costs.These general-purpose JDKs weren't optimized for containers.
They consume more memory, produce larger images, and require substantial tuning for acceptable performance. Standard distributions regularly ship with known CVEs requiring continuous tracking and patching. Oracle's commercial JDK adds licensing complexity that changes unpredictably.Alternatives designed for containerized environments, like Liberica JDK Lite. It delivers optimized performance without specialized tuning, maintains a minimal vulnerability profile, and provides clear licensing terms. 69%of respondents report using JDKs that are shipped with known CVEs Which JDks do you use inside your containers?48%21%14%8%7%2%Oracle/OpenJDK Adoptium/Temurin Amazon Corretto I do not use JVM containers BellSoft’s Liberica JDK Other The 2025 State of Container SecurityOrganizations Remain Stuck
in Reactive Security Posture9Responses reveal different security maturity stages. Trusted registries at 45% and vulnerability scanning at 43% represent basic hygiene—catching known vulnerabilities reactively. SBOM generation at 18% and image signing at 16% address supply chain visibility but remain challenging to implement. Only 6% use hardware isolation.Ten percent report no additional security measures beyond standard tools.The focus remains heavily weighted toward detection and monitoring rather than prevention. Most organizations are trapped in reactive security, constantly responding to newly discovered vulnerabilities rather than building on foundations that minimize exposure from day one.What container security mechanisms do you currently apply?Secure container isolation using hardware virtualization (gVisor, Kata Containers) 6%10%No additional measures used 16%Image signing

In today's threat landscape, this represents substantial risk.Time between vulnerability disclosure and exploitation continues shrinking. What once took weeks now happens in days. Organizations updating monthly or less operate with known vulnerabilities attackers actively exploit.The reasons are understandable: updates require testing, validation, and coordination. But this creates a dangerous pattern. The longer you delay, the more changes accumulate, making each update riskier—a negative feedback loop that further discourages frequent updates.With every application release Only when critical vulnerabilities are found MonthlyRarely (every few months or less) Weekly 31%26%19%14%10%The 2025 State of Container SecurityOne in Four Hit by Security Incidents11Twenty-three percent reported security incidents—18% minor and 5% major. The problem isn't detection—it's the gap between vulnerability disclosure and remediation. During this window, often weeks or months, organizations operate with known exposures.The 60% reporting no incidents shouldn't breed complacency. Many haven't experienced attempted attacks yet or lack visibility to detect successful intrusions.The data reinforces a critical point: reactive security measures aren't sufficient. Organizations need approaches that minimize risks of human mistakes and vulnerability exposure from the foundation.In the past 12 months,

The second cluster revolves around  patching difficulties at 36%, gaps before patches at 32%, and false positives at 29%. The third centers on  time constraints at 49% and lack of organizational priority at 36%.These clusters reinforce each other. Insufficient resources lead to rushed implementations, causing human errors. The overwhelming CVE workload consumes available time, leaving no capacity for proactive improvements.Human errors and mistakesCVE managementHuman Resources & SupportMain challenges you see

Pre-hardened images at 48%, better automation at 47%, and more resources at 36% are different approaches to the same problem.Pre-hardened images shift from reactive to proactive security. The vendor handles all the firefighting—scanning, patching, and testing. Whenever you pull an image from the registry, it's free of known CVEs and stays that way. Patching becomes the vendor's responsibility, completely removing this workload from your teams.43%Better/easier automated tools 21%Better integration with development workflows 36%More time and resources 19%Executive support and prioritization 48%Pre-hardened, security-focused base images 29%Clearer best practices and guidelines What would most help your organization improve container security?The 2025 State of Container SecurityConclusionAcross every section of the survey, one message repeats consistently: Teams want security, efficiency, and simplicity, but their current tooling makes this difficult to achieve.The 48% requesting pre-hardened images aren't just looking for
a security tool. They're signaling a desire to build their platform engineering on a foundation that's secure by default. Hardened vendor-maintained images directly address the root causes of today's container security challenges, reducing vulnerability exposure, operational strain, cloud costs, and risk of human errors.As the industry moves beyond reactive security, hardened images are emerging as the most effective path toward stable, low-maintenance, high-security container environments.14want pre-hardened, security-focused images48%The 2025 State of Container Security
