## 5 Tips to Help Keep Kids Safer in a Connected World

1.  **Start the Conversation Early**
    Don’t wait until there’s a problem—talk to your children about online behavior, safety, and kindness from the moment they
    start using devices. Tools like The Smart Talk by Norton make it easier to guide age-appropriate conversations around digital
    habits and expectations.

2.  **Use Parental Control Tools Thoughtfully**
    Take advantage of built-in device settings and trusted parental control tools to set screen time limits, block inappropriate content, and
    monitor online activity. Norton solutions, such as Norton Family with features like School Time, can help parents create healthy digital
    boundaries while fostering trust and transparency.

3.  **Teach Kids to Recognize Red Flags**
    Help children understand the signs of cyberbullying, scams, AI manipulation, or predatory behavior, and empower them to speak up if
    something feels off.

4.  **Model Healthy Tech Use**
    Kids mirror adult behavior. Set a positive example by putting devices down during family time, managing your own screen use,
    and showing how to engage responsibly online.

5.  **Stay Involved, Stay Curious**
    Regularly check in with your child about what they’re doing online. Ask questions, explore apps together, and keep learning
    about new trends – whether it’s AI chatbots or the latest social media platform.
