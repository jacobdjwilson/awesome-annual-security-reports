## Foreword

2024 was a milestone year for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). As companies grappled with increasing regulatory demands, growing stakeholder expectations, and an ever-expanding risk landscape, the importance of GRC programs rose to prominence. This push resulted from several drivers, including new government regulations like the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and NIS2. Meanwhile, tech stack overlaps at companies and reliance on vendors continues to deepen, causing third-party risk to expand.

Regulatory bodies in the US also continued to expand their oversight of cybersecurity practices, requiring organizations to demonstrate proactive risk management. We anticipate the regulatory climate in the United States will be more complex in 2025.

Increasing AI adoption also added complexity to the equation due to new emerging risks like cybersecurity threats, ethical concerns, and potential operational disruptions. Organizations found themselves needing to mature their GRC programs and provide the frameworks needed to manage these risks while enabling innovation. As a result, GRC is no longer seen as a back-office function — it is a public-facing responsibility that influences brand reputation and your ability to land and expand new markets.

GRC maturity is no longer a back-office function — it is a public-facing responsibility that influences brand reputation and your ability to land and expand new markets.

So, what’s the impact for 2025?

The findings of this survey reflect a decisive trend: organizations are responding to the changes seen in 2024 and making deliberate efforts to mature their GRC practices, not just for compliance but as a strategic imperative for long-term resilience and success. From integrating technology solutions that centralize risk and compliance activities to fostering cross-functional collaboration and embedding a culture of accountability, these efforts are reshaping the GRC space. Our findings highlight a shift in perspective within the market: GRC teams are looking to mature their practices, as they are no longer seen as a check box exercise but a driver of operational excellence and strategic growth.

As you explore the insights provided in this report, we invite you to consider how these trends align with your own organization’s journey, especially in the coming year. Whether you are in the early stages of building a GRC program or refining a well-established program, there is much to learn from the collective experience of your peers. Together, we have an opportunity to elevate the role of GRC in shaping a more resilient, responsible, and forward-looking business environment.

## Top Findings in Numbers

## CHAPTER 1 GRC Programs Are Maturing

A common theme in this year’s findings is the importance of centralized and cohesive approaches to GRC. Organizations that consolidate GRC activities under a single team report better consistency and efficiency in managing risks. In 2024, Hyperproof released our own GRC Maturity Model to provide a commonly accepted way for companies to assess and improve their own GRC capabilities. The model is segmented into four levels:

- **Traditional**: reactive with insufficient or no planning
- **Initial**: beginning to define processes at a departmental level
- **Advanced**: establishing defined, repeatable processes at the organizational level
- **Optimal**: proactively using measurements to continuously improve performance

Each level is defined by unique characteristics to help organizations identify where their company might be on the path to GRC maturity. Our findings revealed that respondents are approaching GRC maturity with four key strategies aligned to the Hyperproof GRC Maturity Model: centralizing GRC efforts, leveraging a common controls framework (CCF), conducting quarterly risk assessments, and adopting comprehensive risk management programs with people, processes, and technology. As you explore this chapter, we encourage you to review the Hyperproof GRC Maturity Model to see where your organization lands and whether you have implemented the four strategies outlined below.

### STRATEGY 1: Centralizing enterprise-wide risk and compliance efforts under a single team

Most notably, we found that 91% of respondents reported having a centralized team responsible for GRC activities. This is up from last year, where 83% of respondents reported having a centralized team managing GRC activities. Only 8% of respondents take a siloed approach to risk management, where individual teams or business units manage risks.

The high adoption of centralized GRC teams indicates a strong trend toward integration in the market, as most organizations recognize the importance of taking a unified approach to risk and compliance management. However, those 8% of organizations still operating in silos face significant challenges, including inconsistent risk mitigation practices and inefficiencies, which we will discuss later in this chapter.

**Does your organization have a centralized governance, risk, and compliance program that works across business units and geographies?**
- Yes: 91%
- No: 8%
- I don’t know: 1%

Centralization does not mean a shared responsibility across all elements of GRC. In fact, 43% of organizations still view compliance primarily as the function responsible for enforcing regulations and industry standards. This is similar to last year’s results, where 45% of respondents chose this option. Another 36% see compliance as a tool to mitigate risks, although they acknowledge that risk management and compliance activities are often conducted independently in response to specific events.

However, a new and integrated approach is emerging, with 22% of organizations choosing to align risk and compliance activities, a 55% increase year-over-year. One example of this kind of approach is connecting controls to risks, which means when addressing an issue on a control, the risk associated with that control would be reduced.

**Approach to managing IT risks**
- Ad-hoc or when a negative event happens: 65%
- In siloed departments, processes, and tools: 29%
- An integrated tool and it’s mostly manual: 5%
- An integrated tool and it’s mostly automated: 41%
- Our MSSP manages our IT risks: 52%
- Compliance is responsible for enforcing regulations / industry standards: 6%
- Risk management and compliance activities are typically conducted in response to separate events: 30%
- Our risk and compliance activities are integrated: 48%

### STRATEGY 2: Leveraging a common controls framework

55% of respondents said they utilize a common controls framework (CCF) that aggregates and rationalizes regulations to boost efficiency when addressing rules and requirements across different frameworks. This represents a 10% increase year-over-year, showcasing that this was not a short-term trend. The remaining organizations were split in how they adapted to new regulations, with 25% choosing to align to the most regional laws while 6% maintain a reactive approach of responding to individual changes as they happen. This segmentation highlights the various levels of maturity across organizations. Mature organizations choose to look ahead and streamline their processes, while others remain siloed in their approach to GRC.

**How does your organization adapt its cybersecurity and compliance controls to manage regional variances in data security and privacy regulations?**
- We use a CCF to unify compliance requirements: 55%
- We align our compliance activities with the most rigorous regional law: 25%
- We have a dedicated team or department: 6%
- We deal with regulations as they are passed: 6%

### STRATEGY 3: Conducting quarterly risk assessments

The frequency of risk assessments saw the largest shift year-over-year, with 59% of respondents stating they conducted quarterly assessments as opposed to annually, compared to 45% last year. One reason for this shift is the continued adoption of risk management technology, which has reduced the burden associated with conducting these assessments, and companies have realized the value of having real-time visibility of their risk postures.

**How often does your organization conduct security risk assessments?**
- Quarterly: 59%
- Twice a year: 23%
- Annually: 8%
- Ad-hoc: 9%
- Annually, after a security incident or major changes: 1%

Many organizations also recognize the value of engaging with third-party consultants to find system gaps. 73% of respondents have engaged with third-party consultants to perform regular security assessments or penetration tests. It’s important to note that frameworks like PCI DSS require penetration testing, and DORA will require red-teaming. 13% of respondents adhere to PCI DSS, and 10% adhere to DORA.

**Have you taken the following actions to formalize your commitment to risk management?**
- Use a risk management standard /framework: 88%
- Have designated owners for distinct risks: 86%
- Have a cross-functional risk/compliance committee: 83%
- Have a tech architecture that supports integrated risk management: 79%
- Conduct regular risk assessments: 77%
- Conduct risk assessments when major changes occur: 75%
- Have a regularly updated risk register: 74%
- Have a dedicated risk committee: 73%
- Conduct regular internal audits/ assessments on internal controls: 72%
- Have mapped risks to controls: 70%
- Track GRC objectives with policies and risk mitigation controls: 69%
- Use KRIs linked to KPIs to monitor high or critical risks: 68%
- Engaged third-party consultants to perform regular security assessments or pen tests: 73%
- Use automated tools for continuous monitoring of risks and controls effectiveness: 65%

### STRATEGY 4: Adopting comprehensive risk management programs with people, processes, and technology

Over half (58%) of all respondents recognize that IT risk management requires integrated efforts across roles and teams. Many organizations have streamlined their approaches: 38% of all respondents have automated most of their IT risk management procedures. The number of organizations that continue to manage IT risk in silos has continued to decline year-over-year. Last year, 19% of organizations said they manage IT risks in silos, compared to 16% this year.

**Which of the following statements is the closest reflection of how your organization manages IT risks?**
- Integrated approach, processes are mostly automated: 38%
- Integrated approach, processes are mostly manual: 16%
- In siloed departments, processes, and tools: 16%
- Our MSSP manages our IT risks: 20%
- Ad-hoc or when a negative event happens: 10%

## CHAPTER 2 Framework Adoption Trends

This year’s survey reveals an important shift: organizations are moving from reactive, checklist-driven approaches toward proactive, integrated strategies that align risk and compliance management with their broader business goals. Companies are also adopting frameworks and tools that reduce inefficiencies and improve consistency to streamline operations. The majority of respondents (64%) use dedicated risk management software, and 72% of organizations use software that monitors their security controls and provides compliance posture reporting. This trend reflects a growing recognition that fragmented, manual processes hinder performance and scalability.

- **72%** of organizations use software that monitors their security controls and provides compliance posture reporting.

### Cybersecurity and data privacy framework usage

Cybersecurity and data privacy framework usage remains relatively steady year-over-year. ISO 27001 leads adoption with 41% adherence, reflecting its global recognition for information security management. NIST CSF follows closely, with 39% of organizations leveraging its guidance to manage and reduce cybersecurity risks effectively. SOC I and SOC II are also widely implemented at 34%.

Regional regulations like GDPR are prioritized by 32% of organizations, underscoring the importance of data protection and privacy in EU markets, which we will discuss in detail later in this chapter. Similarly, CCPA has gained traction, with 21% adherence, reflecting growing attention to U.S. state-level privacy laws.

As organizations seek to align their practices with both global and regional compliance requirements, they tend to prefer widely recognized standards and frameworks with controls they can repurpose for additional frameworks as they add them. Organizations are now taking a proactive approach to managing security and privacy because they need to support business expansion and pursuit of new markets, especially in the EU.

**Which cybersecurity and/or data privacy compliance frameworks does your organization adhere to or plan to adhere to in the next 12 months?**
- ISO 27001: 41%
- NIST CSF: 39%
- SOC I / SOC II: 34%
- GDPR: 32%
- CCPA: 21%

### IT risk management framework usage

Among the most widely used frameworks, NIST SP 800-37 leads with 44% adoption, signaling its usefulness in guiding organizations to assess, respond to, and monitor IT risks. Close behind is the NIST AI RMF, adopted by 42% of respondents, highlighting the growing focus on managing risks specific to AI systems.

Global standards like ISO 31000 (34%) and ISO 42001:2023 (32%) are also popular, demonstrating their value in offering comprehensive approaches to risk management — including guidelines for AI risk — across diverse industries. Additionally, 31% of organizations use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, frameworks designed for managing systems and software engineering life cycles.

Other notable frameworks include the COSO Enterprise Risk Management framework (30%), reflecting its relevance for integrating IT risk into overall enterprise risk strategies, and the FAIR Risk Management model (27%), which is widely recognized for its quantitative approach to risk assessment. Meanwhile, 5% of organizations surveyed reported using no formal IT risk management framework, indicating potential gaps in their approach to managing IT vulnerabilities.

**Which of the following IT risk management frameworks does your organization use?**
- NIST SP 800-37: 44%
- NIST AI RMF: 42%
- ISO 31000: 34%
- ISO 42001:2023: 32%
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207: 31%
- COSO Enterprise Risk Management: 30%
- FAIR Risk Management model: 27%
- No formal framework: 5%

### Preparing for AI regulations

Organizations aren’t just implementing more AI-related controls because they are wary of the risks introduced by increased AI tools usage; regulatory bodies are requiring them to do so. While a majority of companies are proactively addressing AI-related risks in line with forthcoming EU regulations, a significant portion remains in transition. Our findings underscore the importance of continued efforts to fully implement robust risk management systems, ensuring compliance and fostering trustworthy AI practices across markets.

- **59%** have implemented a risk management framework due to the EU AI Act.

Organizations aren’t just implementing more AI-related controls because they are wary of the risks introduced by increased AI tools usage; regulatory bodies are requiring them to do so.

### The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

All financial institutions in the EU and ICT vendors of financial institutions must comply with DORA, a European Union regulation aimed at bolstering the financial sector’s ability to withstand and recover from digital disruptions and cyber threats. Adopted on November 28, 2022, DORA entered into force on January 16, 2023, with enforcement beginning on January 17, 2025.

While DORA does not explicitly address artificial intelligence (AI) systems, its comprehensive ICT risk management framework encompasses AI technologies utilized within financial operations. Financial institutions employing AI for functions like fraud detection or credit scoring must ensure these systems adhere to DORA’s standards for operational resilience.

We asked respondents how far along their organization is preparing for DORA enforcement in January 2025. We found that over 90% of organizations have already started preparing for DORA.

**How far along is your organization in preparing for Digital Operation Resilience Act’s (DORA) enforcement in January 2025?**
- Unprepared, have not started: 0%
- In progress, unlikely to be ready by January 2025: 1%
- In progress, on track to be ready by Jan 2025: 40%
- Already prepared: 50%
- DORA does not apply to us: 9%

We also asked organizations to rate their confidence in their ICT providers’ readiness to meet DORA’s stringent requirements. 49% are “very confident” in their providers’ preparedness, citing regular audits and ongoing communication as key compliance indicators. An additional 41% express confidence, noting observable progress in aligning operations with DORA standards.

However, 9% of respondents are only “somewhat confident,” indicating that while their providers know DORA, a comprehensive assessment of readiness is still pending. A small fraction (1%) lack confidence, expressing concerns about their providers’ understanding and capability to comply with DORA’s mandates. Notably, nearly all organizations recognize the applicability of DORA, with only 0.1% stating it does not apply to them.

These findings underscore a general sense of assurance among organizations regarding their ICT providers’ compliance with DORA. Nonetheless, uncertainty among some organizations highlights the need for continued diligence in evaluating and ensuring provider readiness as the enforcement date nears.

**What is your level of confidence that your ICT providers will comply with DORA’s stringent requirements?**
- Very confident: 49%
- Confident: 41%
- Somewhat confident: 9%
- Not confident: 1%
- DORA does not apply to us: 0.1%

### The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act)

**Has your company implemented a comprehensive risk management framework to address risks associated with the use of AI under the EU AI Act?**
- Yes: 59%
- Partially: 34%
- No: 4%
- Not applicable: 3%

In addition to DORA, EU regulators are actively developing regulatory frameworks to govern AI applications and systems. The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), adopted in May 2024, establishes a comprehensive framework to regulate AI systems to ensure their safe and ethical deployment across various sectors.

We asked respondents whether their organization has implemented risk management frameworks to address AI risks and comply with the EU AI Act. The results reveal varied stages of readiness in implementing comprehensive risk management frameworks to address AI-related risks.

Notably, 59% of respondents report fully establishing such frameworks, aligning with the AI Act’s stringent requirements. An additional 34% have initiated the process but have yet to fully comply. Meanwhile, 4% are in the preliminary stages, currently assessing the Act’s mandates and planning future framework development. Another 4% consider the AI Act inapplicable to their operations, likely due to their AI system usage.

**How is your organization handling the overlapping compliance requirements between DORA, NIS2, and GDPR?**
- We have established a CCF that addresses common controls across DORA, NIS2, and GDPR: 42%
- We handle each regulation separately: 30%
- We prioritize compliance with GDPR due to its broader applicability: 17%
- We are still in the early stages of analyzing the requirements of DORA and NIS2: 10%
- Not applicable: 0%
- None of the above: 0%
- DORA does not apply to us: 0%

## CHAPTER 3 How Organizations Address GRC Tasks

Respondents are transitioning from fragmented, reactive GRC task management to a more mature and proactive approach, enabling them to manage risks more effectively. This evolution underscores the importance of GRC maturity as a critical driver of operational security and organizational success. Our survey has shown a clear correlation between IT risk management approaches and the likelihood of experiencing a security breach involving sensitive data for three consecutive years. Organizations managing IT risk reactively or in siloed environments consistently report higher breach rates than those using integrated, automated tools. In 2022, 77% of respondents who managed IT risk ad-hoc experienced a breach, compared to 57% of those using automated GRC solutions.

By 2024, this trend continued, with companies managing their IT risks ad-hoc having a 25% higher chance of experiencing a breach than those that take an integrated approach. This data highlights a crucial trend: as organizations adopt more mature and integrated GRC practices, they significantly reduce the likelihood of experiencing a data breach. The steady decline in breach rates among organizations using integrated and automated tools reflects a broader shift toward proactive risk management and more sophisticated evidence collection, control monitoring, and compliance processes.

### Confidence in the ability to identify risks is high, but control management remains more difficult

We found a spectrum of responses when we asked respondents to self-assess how well their organizations performed risk management tasks. Notably, 97% of respondents believe they meet their objectives in identifying and assessing risks, indicating strong capabilities in this foundational area. However, performance declines in other areas: 88% report success in identifying controls, 84% in validating these controls against standard compliance frameworks, and 83% in aligning controls with identified risks.

- **97%** believe they meet their objectives in identifying and assessing risks.

The data shows that certain actions are harder to do well. For example:
- **19%** feel they are not effectively monitoring and conducting automated control testing.
- **23%** are not confident in their processes for flagging exceptions, reviewing, and remediating issues.
- **19%** are not fully satisfied with their process for assessing controls’ effectiveness and capturing, tracking, and reporting deficiencies.
- **18%** report they have room for improvement in assigning and tracking risk owners.
- **17%** said they’re not meeting objectives when documenting risk decisions.

While companies are proficient in initial risk identification and assessment, there is room for improvement when implementing and monitoring controls, documenting controls, and remediating controls.

**How well is your company performing each of the following risk management actions?**
- Identify and assess risks: Meets objectives 97%
- Identify controls: Meets objectives 88%
- Validate controls against standard controls: Meets objectives 84%
- Align controls with risks: Meets objectives 83%
- Monitor and automate controls testing: Meets objectives 81%
- Flag exceptions, review, and remediate: Meets objectives 77%
- Assess controls effectiveness: Meets objectives 81%
- Capture, track, and report deficiencies: Meets objectives 81%
- Assign and track risk owners: Meets objectives 82%
- Document risk decisions: Meets objectives 83%

### Using integrated tools to manage IT risks may reduce the likelihood of a data breach

Organizations using integrated tools to manage IT risk are less likely to experience data breaches. In 2024, 60% of organizations managing IT risk ad-hoc or when a negative event happens experienced a data breach, compared to only 35% using an integrated, mostly manual tool and 41% using an integrated, automated tool.

- **60%** of organizations managing IT risk ad-hoc or when a negative event happens experienced a data breach in 2024.

**Has your organization experienced a data or privacy breach in the last year?**
- By IT risk management approach:
  - Ad-hoc or when a negative event happens: Yes 60%
  - In siloed departments, processes, and tools: Yes 48%
  - An integrated tool and it’s mostly manual: Yes 35%
  - An integrated tool and it’s mostly automated: Yes 41%

### Evidence collection habits

A surprising majority of companies (71%) still take a reactive approach to evidence collection, gathering evidence ad-hoc or only for audits. This approach can have long-term efficiency impacts, due to teams spending the majority of their time on menial tasks instead of strategic work.

- **71%** still take a reactive approach to evidence collection, gathering evidence ad-hoc or only for audits.

**Choose the statement that most accurately reflects how your organization approaches evidence collection:**
- Only for internal and external audits: 46%
- Continuously collect evidence: 11%
- Only for external audits: 14%
- Ad-hoc: 29%

### Control testing and monitoring trends

Another example of the push to greater maturity is the shift from testing only a subset of controls to testing all of their controls. This year, 59% of respondents reported that they test all controls instead of only the most critical controls, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Several factors could be contributing to this shift, including:
- The fact that mature organizations recognize that vulnerabilities can exist in any part of their control environment, not just in critical areas.
- Mature organizations are more likely to prioritize continuous monitoring and regular testing.
- The increased adoption of a common control framework (CCF), which limits the number of controls needed to be tested.
- The increased adoption of technology that reduces the overall control testing burden.

**What best describes your organization’s approach to evaluating the effectiveness of security and compliance controls?**
- Evaluate the effectiveness of all controls: 59%
- Evaluate controls to meet upcoming audit requirements: 34%
- Evaluate only the most critical controls: 7%

### Risk and compliance services outsourced

While organizations surveyed spend most of their budgets on building internal capabilities, they recognize the strategic value external specialists can provide. Organizations will most likely outsource IT security, asset management, and risk assessments to strengthen cybersecurity resilience in response to growing threats. Many also turn to consulting firms for policy generation and compliance management to navigate the complexities of evolving regulatory frameworks, likely because they balance compliance and risk management needs with internal capacity limitations. The GRC space also faced hiring freezes in 2024, which could have led to increased reliance on outsourcing. Additionally, the industry experienced a shortage of IT professionals last year, which could drive the need to outsource. ISC2’s 2024 Cybersecurity Workforce Study found that the size of the active cybersecurity workforce only grew 0.1% in 2024, compared to 8.7% the previous year.

**What services do you outsource to consulting/security and compliance advisory firms?**
- IT security: 60%
- Risk assessments: 58%
- Policy generation: 55%
- Compliance management: 52%
- Asset management: 49%
- Penetration testing: 45%
- Incident response: 40%
- Security awareness training: 35%
- Business continuity/disaster recovery planning: 30%
- Vendor risk management: 28%
- Cloud security: 25%
- Data privacy: 20%
- Third-party risk management: 18%
- Other: 5%

### Audit challenges

The greatest burden on passing audits and verifying compliance is related to evidence validation, user access, communication, and document management. These challenges highlight the complexities of audits and their strain on teams: they are all time-consuming, resource-intensive processes that reflect GRC teams’ ongoing challenges.

**When it comes to preparing for and executing audits, what tasks do you find to be tedious or take longer than you’d like?**
- Testing and validating evidence before submission to external auditors: 60%
- Managing user access reviews and ensuring users have appropriate access rights: 55%
- Training others to assist, complete tasks, or do administrative activities: 45%
- Communicating audit requirements to stakeholders: 40%
- Providing evidence / documentation to the external auditor: 35%
- Responding to auditor requests and follow-up requests: 30%
- Locating documents and other information needed for the audit: 25%
- Filing, storing, managing compliance documentation: 20%
- Communicating with the auditor: 15%
- Interpretation of audit requirements and compliance standards: 10%

### Administrative work and repetitive tasks

For many organizations, administrative work remains a significant burden, with 52% of respondents estimating their teams spend between 30% and 50% of their time on these tasks. This suggests substantial opportunities for efficiency gains through automation or process improvements exist.

**What portion of your risk and compliance management team’s time is spent on repetitive/administrative tasks?**
- Less than 10%: 10%
- 10% to 20%: 18%
- 20% to 30%: 20%
- 30% to 50%: 52%
- More than 50%: 0%

### Hidden inefficiencies of GRC

Despite efforts by GRC teams to streamline workflows, adopt new processes, and better integrate their work, our respondents stated that their work is still burdensome and certain tasks are too laborious.

The most challenging and tedious risk-related work items can be categorized under four themes:
- Data entry, including tracking risk decisions or entering the status of a risk item.
- Having to switch between too many systems to complete a single process.
- Making sense of disparate data sources and systems to identify where the critical risks are and what caused the risk.
- Managing user permissions and conducting user access reviews.

**What recurring or time-consuming tasks do you struggle with when managing security and data privacy risks?**
- Data entry tasks: 50%
- Identifying critical risks: 45%
- Switching between multiple systems: 40%
- Conducting user access reviews: 35%
- Finding risk-related information: 30%
- Ensuring controls are consistently applied across departments: 25%
- Following up with other departments: 20%
- Tracking remediation progress: 15%
- Getting a continuous view of risks/compliance status: 10%
- Collecting necessary data to test controls: 5%
- Maintaining traceability from regulatory / contractual / legal requirements to policy to control to evidence of control operation: 5%
- Assembling reports for executives: 5%
- None of the above: 0%

### IT risk management and compliance tools

GRC teams are leaning toward using integrated, automated tools for risk tracking, decision-making, validating controls, testing evidence, and much more. This year, there is a notable preference for dedicated or integrated software solutions, including the automation features respondents need to operationalize their processes over manual or legacy methods. This push toward operationalization indicates that respondents use technology to strategically address areas of GRC that have traditionally been managed via ad-hoc manual processes.
