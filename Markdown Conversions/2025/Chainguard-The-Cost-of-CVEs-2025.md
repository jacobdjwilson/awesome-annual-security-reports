## Executive Summary

In-house management of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in containerized environments is a significant, and often hidden cost for many organizations. Our analysis of customer experiences with Chainguard Containers reveals that CVE remediation, image hardening, compliance, and customer escalations impose heavy operational burdens—costing organizations millions in wasted engineering time, lost revenue opportunities, and increased risk.

### Key Findings

- **CVE Management Costs You More Than You Think**: Engineering teams are often bogged down with CVE management tasks like triaging, patching, and compliance reporting. This takes valuable time away from revenue-generating activities like feature development and product innovation. As a result, teams often face delayed releases, reduced product quality, and missed market opportunities.
- **The Hidden Costs of DIY CVE Remediation**: Many organizations continue to handle CVE management internally, which often results in inefficiencies and high labor costs. On average, companies that outsource CVE remediation to Chainguard realize $2.1 million in annual savings from that specific task alone—allowing them to reallocate engineering efforts towards strategic initiatives.
- **Outsourcing CVE Management Delivers Tangible Business Value**: Organizations that outsource CVE management experience a broad range of benefits:
    - **Cost Savings**: Reduced operational overhead from CVE remediation, image hardening, and compliance tasks.
    - **Increased Revenue**: Unlock new markets, particularly highly regulated ones, by leveraging secure and compliant container images.
    - **Faster Innovation**: Free up development teams to focus on creating new features and accelerating time-to-market.
    - **Decreased Risk**: Proactively eliminate vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of costly breaches, fines, and customer churn.
- **ROI Across Industries**: Our analysis shows that companies in the Healthcare, Financial Services, Telecommunications & Infrastructure (Telecom), Technology, and Consumer & Commerce industries can unlock millions in cost savings and new revenue. For instance, Healthcare organizations saved $50 million annually on average, with $39 million of that coming from reduced risk.

## Introduction

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in containers are more than just a routine nuisance — they impose substantial and ongoing operational costs. If you're responsible for platform or application security, you likely already know the burden: scanning, triaging, and remediating CVEs eats up time, saps engineering cycles, and shifts focus away from delivering business value.

Over the last few years, high-profile vulnerabilities like Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) and recent Ingress-NGINX remote code execution CVEs have underscored the stakes. These incidents disrupted teams globally — not just because of their technical severity, but because of how difficult, time-consuming, and expensive they were to manage in containerized environments.

But how costly is CVE management, really? That’s the question we set out to answer.

There has been little research on this topic. In 2022, Ponemon and Rezilion published _The State of Vulnerability Management in DevSecOps_. And back in 2024, we published _The True Cost of CVE Management in Containers_. We interviewed software professionals who handled CVE management as part of their daily responsibilities at a variety of different organizations, asking about the time they were spending managing CVEs in containers, the specific pain points, and what that time ultimately cost. The results were clear: teams are spending significant portions of their engineering time on CVE work — often at the expense of core business initiatives. And in most cases, they’d rather not be.

Since the initial study, Chainguard has grown to serve over 160 organizations, many of whom have echoed those frustrations. Whether large or small, no matter the vertical, these teams consistently report that CVE management remains a major drag on developer time — especially when specialized expertise is required for triage and remediation. And that ends up costing organizations money.

Many of our customers have worked with Chainguard to quantify the cost of not addressing the CVE management problem in their container images. In this report, we share findings from our analysis, broken down by industry segment (Healthcare, Telecommunications & Infrastructure, Consumer & Commerce, Financial Services and Technology) and organization size — to expose just how costly unmanaged CVEs can be.

## Methodology

Measuring the cost of CVE management and the return on investment organizations can expect when using a solution like Chainguard Containers requires a structured, consistent framework, especially given the range of variables across organizations. To enable meaningful comparison and actionable insight, Chainguard developed a standardized methodology to quantify both the direct costs and return on investment of outsourcing CVE management efforts. Each participating customer provided data specific to their environment, enabling individualized savings calculations across four distinct dimensions, encompassing both internal operational efficiencies and outward-facing market entry dynamics. All data is anonymized to protect customer privacy and confidentiality.

When working with customers to assess the total return on investment for outsourcing CVE management, we begin by understanding the cost savings organizations can expect:

- **Cost Savings**: The cost avoided by eliminating time spent on tasks such as building hardened images, remediating CVEs, achieving compliance (e.g., FIPS, STIGs, etc.), and handling CVE-related customer escalations. This was calculated using inputs like engineering team size, time allocation, and average engineer salary.

After assessing the cost savings, we look at the overall value unlocked, in the form of revenue (by unlocking new markets and freeing up developers) and decreased risk:

- **Increased Revenue**: The new revenue opportunities unlocked through outsourcing image hardening and CVE remediation to Chainguard, by adopting Chainguard Containers. This includes access to highly-regulated and security-conscious markets (e.g., federal contracts), customer deals dependent on vulnerability remediation, and faster release cycles unblocked by security clearance.
- **Faster Innovation**: The revenue generated from reallocating engineering time (previously spent on CVE remediation) toward product development. This includes reducing time-to-market for new features and products, driving higher win rates in B2B and B2C offerings, and expanding addressable markets.
- **Decreased Risk**: The potential loss avoided by preventing a container-based breach. This is modeled using historical breach data, breach likelihood, incident response costs, and estimated reputational damage and customer churn impacting revenue.

During the qualification process, we worked with a selection of participating customers to generate a monetary value attached to each of the four categories. Some opted out of areas that were not relevant to their business model or maturity. As a result, the number of data points varies by the key area under consideration. This variation means that the summation of average benefits across customers does not equal the average of the total summed benefits. To accurately reflect aggregate outcomes, we use the average of the summation for each category rather than simply adding the average benefit for each of the key areas per segment. This approach ensures integrity and avoids misleading inflation or dilution of impact estimates.

After collecting each of these numbers, we divided the data for the participating organizations into five groups based on their industry:
1. Healthcare
2. Telecom & Infrastructure
3. Consumer & Commerce
4. Financial Services
5. Technology

We also split the findings into five different revenue segments based on the organization’s annual revenue:
1. Enterprise: $10 billion+
2. Large: $1 billion–$10 billion
3. Mid-Market: $500 million–$1 billion
4. Growth-Stage: $100 million–$500 million
5. Early-Stage: <$100 million

## The Costs of DIY CVE Management

Engineering teams building CVE management programs in-house often dedicate enormous time and effort to areas outside of the core business functions. This time and effort is costly, and pulls engineers away from innovation and revenue-generating activities. These numbers capture the savings that organizations experience across CVE remediation, image hardening, compliance, and customer escalations.

### Today’s State: The CVE Doom Cycle

### DIY CVE Remediation

For many organizations, doing CVE remediation in-house was incredibly costly. The customers participating in this analysis saved an average of **$2.1 million annually** by outsourcing CVE remediation.

![Bar chart showing CVE Remediation Savings by Industry: Consumer & Commerce $3.1M, Healthcare $1.9M, Financial Services $1.2M, Technology $1.0M, Telecom $606K]

Consumer & Commerce companies saw the largest CVE remediation savings, averaging $3 million annually, due to the intense burden of managing vulnerabilities across fast-moving, microservice-heavy environments.

When filtering the data by revenue segment, mid-market organizations saw the highest average savings at $2.13 million annually, followed by enterprise organizations at an annual average of just below $2 million.

### DIY Image Hardening

Image hardening — the process of securing container base images through proactive vulnerability prevention — also delivered significant savings. These organizations saved an average of over **$400,000 annually** by outsourcing image hardening.
