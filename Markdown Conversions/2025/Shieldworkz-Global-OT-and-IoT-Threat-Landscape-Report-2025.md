# Report Methodology & Data Integrity

The findings and projections in this report are the result of a comprehensive, multi-faceted threat intelligence gathering and analysis process. Our methodology is designed to provide a granular and validated view of the global OT and IoT threat landscape, grounded in real-world data.

## Global Honeypot Network
The primary data source is Shieldworkz's global honeypot network, one of the largest of its kind. This network is engineered to attract and analyze malicious activity on an industrial scale.

- **Scale and Scope**: The network is operational in over 95 cities worldwide and analyzes an average of 39 million attacks each day.
- **Strategic Placement**: Our honeypots are strategically deployed in locations with specific attributes known to attract high-value threat activity, including geopolitical hotspots, internet traffic hubs, submarine cable landing centers, and cities with a high density of critical infrastructure projects.
- **High-Fidelity Emulation**: The network comprises over 10,500 physical and virtual devices mimicking real-world industrial deployments, covering more than 1,200 device architectures. This ensures that the attack data collected reflects tactics used against actual ICS and IoT environments.

![Infrastructure Scale]
![Global Reach]
![Daily Threat Volume]

## Multi-Source Intelligence Corroboration
To enrich and validate our honeypot data, we integrate intelligence from a wide range of other sources:

- **The Cybercriminal Underground**: We actively monitor and surveil hackers' forums, malware platforms, the Dark Web, and other validated channels where threat actors collaborate. This includes running "dark honeypots" in locations where new attack vectors emerge.
- **Institutional and Research Partners**: We incorporate data from universities, government agencies, and other reputable sources to provide additional context and validation.

## Rigorous Analytical Framework
Every captured attack is systematically fingerprinted, categorized, and analyzed.

- **Threat Ranking**: We utilize a proprietary threat rank index, a priority assessment framework developed by Shieldworkz, to score and prioritize threats.
- **Standardized Classification**: For tactical analysis, we use the Mitre ATT&CK framework to sub-classify attacks, ensuring our findings are aligned with industry-standard methodologies.

This rigorous, multi-layered approach ensures the integrity and reliability of our data, allowing us to deliver insights and forecasts with a high degree of confidence.

# A New Era of Industrial Cyber Risk
The convergence of sophisticated adversaries, weaponized AI, and escalating geopolitical tensions has redefined the threat landscape for critical infrastructure.

The 2025 threat landscape for Operational Technology (OT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) is defined by an unprecedented escalation in the frequency, sophistication, and strategic intent of cyberattacks. Analysis by Shieldworkz Threat Research Labs reveals a pivotal shift: adversaries are not just breaching networks, but systematically weaponizing new technologies, exploiting geopolitical tensions, and industrializing their attack methodologies.

```
79%
Surge in cyberattacks targeting
the energy sector in 2024,
making it the most targeted
industry globally.
```

```
17%
Rise in internet-accessible
Industrial Control System
(ICS) ports detected between
November and December 2024.
```

# Key Finding 1
The Industrialization of Cybercrime & The Rise of AI

Advanced hacker groups have evolved into well-structured entities that resemble mature businesses, with streamlined processes for everything from target selection to ransom negotiations. This operational maturity is now supercharged by the integration of Artificial Intelligence, which is being used to automate and enhance nearly every phase of an attack.

![AI-Powered Offense]
![Industrialized Operations]

- **AI-Powered Offense**: Adversaries now use AI-based tools to break proprietary protocols, autonomously manage compromised botnets, and generate highly convincing phishing emails. Threat groups like RansomHub are actively using AI for target identification, attack deployment, and crunching stolen data.
- **Autonomous Malware**: We are detecting new forms of "semi-sentient" malware with minimal code that can autonomously evolve within a target network, bypass signature-based detection, and exfiltrate data stealthily.
- **Threat Actor Growth**: Despite increased reliance on AI, major threat actors expanded their recruitment of human affiliates in 2024, capitalizing on the uncertainty created by global elections.

# Key Finding 2
Critical Infrastructure is the New Battlefield

State-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups from nations including Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran are conducting coordinated, multi-year reconnaissance campaigns against Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) in over 100 nations. These operations are designed to establish persistent access and lay dormant implants that can be triggered during geopolitical escalations.

- **Geopolitical Targeting**: Attacks are increasingly correlated with geopolitical flashpoints. Chinese APTs, operating under the Ministry of State Security (MSS), are running persistent, country-focused campaigns, such as the multi-year breach of India's power grid infrastructure by APT 41.
- **Expanding Attack Surface**: A 17% rise in internet-accessible ICS ports was detected between November and December 2024. Our scans identified 40,983 accessible ICS ports in North America alone in a single scan.
- **Sectoral Hotspots**: The energy sector is the most-attacked industry, followed by manufacturing and healthcare. Within the oil and gas sector, 47% of incidents had an "Unknown" impact, indicating severe visibility gaps.

![A Vast & Growing Attack Surface]
![Concentrated Sector Risk]

# Key Finding 3
Systemic Vulnerabilities & Defensive Gaps Persist

Despite the escalating sophistication of threats, foundational cybersecurity weaknesses remain dangerously prevalent across industries. These unaddressed gaps provide fertile ground for attackers to succeed with alarming frequency.

- **IT-OT Convergence Risk**: The convergence of IT and OT is enabling threats to move in both directions. However, many organizations lack a well-architected network that properly segregates risk zones from functional zones, leaving their OT environments highly vulnerable.
- **Pervasive Visibility Gaps**: Many asset owners are simply unaware that breaches have occurred and impacted their systems. This is compounded by the presence of shadow assets and unmonitored asset behaviors.
- **Incident Response Immaturity**: The absence of a structured incident response process, a lack of ICS event management specialists, and missing response playbooks significantly amplify the impact of attacks. It is estimated that over 45% of attacks on ICS systems in Asia are currently not reported to any agency outside the enterprise.

```
13%
of serious OT vulnerabilities are now considered
"Forever Day" threats with no available patch,
representing a permanent and unremediated
risk to industrial systems
```

```
45%
The Silent Breach
Of industrial attacks in Asia go unreported
outside the enterprise, crippling collective
threat intelligence and hiding the true scale
of regional risk.
```

```
40%
The Broken Boundary
Of all system attacks specifically target
the IT-OT convergence zone, as adversaries
exploit weak network segmentation to move
laterally from corporate networks into critical
operational environments.
```

# 2025 Projections & Strategic Outlook

The trends observed in 2024 indicate a challenging year ahead. Shieldworkz projects that in 2025, organizations must prepare for the following strategic shifts:

1. **Increased Targeting of Remote and High-Value Assets**
   Attacks on remote assets, such as those in space and offshore oil rigs, will be targeted more frequently by adversaries.
2. **Escalation of Multi-Vector Attack Campaigns**
   A rise in multi-layered attacks is anticipated, combining phishing, zero-day vulnerability exploitation, and sophisticated social engineering tactics to maximize efficacy.
3. **Heightened Focus on OT Security as a Business Imperative**
   OT security will receive heightened attention, with a necessary focus on risk management, vulnerability remediation, and enhanced operational visibility within industrial environments.

The convergence of industrialized cybercrime, state-sponsored aggression, and AI-driven attack tools marks a new and dangerous chapter for OT and IoT security. The findings of this report underscore the urgent need for a paradigm shift in defensive strategies—moving from reactive compliance to proactive, intelligence-led resilience.

# The year that was: looking back at 2024

In 2024, all sectors witnessed a rise in cyberattacks on Industrial Control Systems. A mix of vulnerabilities, attack sophistication, prevalence of unsecured systems and lack of mature practices contributed significantly to the rise in cyberattacks on OT operators.

Threat actors are now using various flavors of AI to aid in attacks. One incredible use case that came to our notice 2024 is the use of AI-based bots to surveil forums that sell exploit data. Once the bot detects such data, the actor enters into a negotiation with the exploit shop to get the best possible rate for procuring the exploit information. We believe that at least one such exploit was used in the attack on a utility company registered in January 2024.

Attacks on ICS systems are still underreported by victims. This could be for various reasons, including ensuring operational confidentiality. Based on verifiable claims, we are able to report that over 45 percent of attacks in Asia are currently not reported to any agency outside the enterprise.

## Increasing attack penetration
Since the last 7 years, cyberattacks on OT systems have moved beyond IT-OT converged zones that exist at levels 4 and 5 as per the Purdue model. The nuisance category of attacks often involve little or no precision and the actor tries to use vulnerabilities or lack of adequate defenses to go deeper into the OT network. Such attacks could impact production but can be contained easily as they involve threat actors and TTPs that are not very sophisticated.

Of bigger concern are more advanced attacks that could cover more assets and operations. Such attacks involved tactics specific to OT systems and functions. The actor may impose a hidden recon payload that stays hidden and studies the OT network for a considerable period of time before striking. All actions and attacks paths in such an attack are deliberate and the impact could be potentially devastating for an OT operator Such attacks could also provide hackers with enough experience and learnings to replicate elsewhere.

All major attacks on ICS infrastructure globally in 2024 had at least one of the following characteristics/attack patterns:

![0101]
![0202]
![0303]
![0404]
![0505]
![0606]
![0707]

Lack of mature cybersecurity practices and employee sensitivity are key internal factors that contribute to a breach.

# Major ICS security trends recorded in 2024

PLCs manufactured by OEMs headquartered in nations that were involved in regional conflicts, but installed in other countries were targeted by APTs. Such attacks have brought a new economic dimension to the ongoing conflicts around the world.

‘Forever day’ vulnerabilities as mentioned by ISA here are becoming a major challenge for OT operators As of December 2024, as per our calculations, at least 13 pecent of serious vulnerabilities have no remediation or patch available which makes these systems vulnerable to a massive strike by threat actors. Furthermore, in many cases, most of the available patches haven’t been deployed because of stability issues and or other issues.

39 percent of all attacks involve advanced actors. Globally, most attacks involved an APT at some stage With many state actors openly engaging private threat actors, ICS-specific malware and tactics are finding their way into easily accessible malware forums faster. Many APT actors including APT 41, APT 28, APT 33 and a few others are collaborating with independent threat actors to test the potency of their malware. The test versions often carry malware versions that are older with traceable codes and backdoor communication to validate a breach

Revenge attacks involving disgruntled insiders, vendors, hacktivists, and other actors with some axe to grind are becoming more common. A large manufacturer in South East Asia was breached by an actor who was rejected during an employment interview by the victim organization Almost 13 percent of published attacks studied by us showed a pattern that could be traced back to an agent that had previous interactions with the victim organization

Lack of visibility into assets continues to present significant challenges to OT asset owners. Based on leaked data being sold on various forums, it is clear that many asset owners are not aware of breaches that have taken place and impacted their systems. The presence of shadow assets, unmonitored asset behaviors, and lack of cyber oversight are all adding to this challenge

We are seeing a growing footprint of AI in cyberattacks on OT systems. Hackers are using AI-based tools to break proprietary protocols, encryptions, and more. Bad actors are also training SLMs to autonomously hack OT systems like PLCs or to manage large and compromised device constellations turned into botnets. Such tools are also used to generate phishing emails or generate traffic from remote sites that appear legitimate to first level defense mechanisms such as firewalls

Involvement of insiders is growing. While it is not easy to say whether these insiders were acting out of a lack of knowledge or were volunteering their services to hackers, 7 of the largest breaches in 2024 were traced back to an insider. It is therefore important to ensure training and sensitization of employees

A large automotive company operating separately in India and Pakistan (under different ownership patterns) was targeted by a new threat actor with links to Iranian APT 33. An interesting aspect of this attack is how the threat actor waited for a year to target the subsidiary operating in Pakistan. Both attacks were carried out using similar tactics starting with a spoofed email sent out on a weekend. The stolen data was sold as separate lots by the same threat actor.

All major threat actors increased their recruitment drives across the globe in 2024. This is despite these groups increasing their reliance on AI tools for executing various phases of their targeting campaigns.

One reason for heighted recruitment of affiliates was the elections in many countries which often creates periods of uncertainty and opens windows for threat actors to exploit.

Countries where elections occurred in 2024

The number of recruits increased in 2024 all the way up to September. The recruitment showed a steep decline from October till December 2024. This aligns well with the elections schedule running across the globe in 2024. The list of nations where elections were held in 2024 is given in the chart below:

It comes as no surprise that many of these nations logged a higher number of cyberattacks in 2024.

## Loose affiliations and loyalty
Change in affiliate behavior : one major change we noticed in 2024 is the lack of exclusivity among affiliates. With major law enforcement action being taken against non-state actors, many affiliates chose to hedge their bets by diversifying their affiliations across groups. This led to a situation where a single affiliate was earning ransom across multiple events using multiple encryptors and decryptors. Several affiliates were also modifying malware on their own unlike before.

## Air gaps are hurting
Air gaps, once considered a reliable security measure, are no longer perceived as such for various reasons. For one, they often create a false sense of assurance about an organization's actual security level. Air-gapped networks may convey a sense of security that does not accurately reflect the true risks present on the shop floor. In many instances, networks believed to be air-gapped were, in reality, not fully isolated. Systems were often connected to the internet through mobile hotspots introduced by employees, removable USB drives, or temporary connectivity established during maintenance windows.

## Absence of security acceptance testing
Security acceptance testing is yet to be incorporated as a standard and mandatory cyber hygiene practice in many organizations and this has led to many security challenges arising across the lifecycle of an OT asset such as

Undetected Vulnerabilities – Security flaws in systems, applications, or configurations may go unnoticed, increasing the risk of exploitation by attackers.
