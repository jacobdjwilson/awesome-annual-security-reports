### Prepare for impact: AI is in the building

Our survey reveals executive sentiment, concerns, and priorities around artificial intelligence.

Although artificial intelligence (AI) has existed since the 1950s, the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 propelled the technology into the forefront of just about every conversation. AI is featured everywhere, from newspaper headlines and social media takes to team stand-ups and board meetings. And that discussion hasn’t quieted.

That’s because every week seems to bring about a new leap in either the technology itself or how organizations infuse it into their products and internal systems. But legitimate businesses aren’t the only ones taking advantage of AI to accelerate innovation, boost efficiency, and ignite productivity.

Bad actors have also embraced the tech, using it to develop, scale, and launch increasingly sophisticated attacks. The topic of security and how it relates to AI is inextricable from any conversation regarding this fast-moving technology.

To better understand how AI impacts the intersection of security, innovation, and operational efficiency, we commissioned an AlphaSights survey of 125 executives across three regions, targeting the decision-makers typically tasked with helming those efforts at companies:

- **CSOs/CISOs** for their focus on security
- **CTOs** for their focus on innovation
- **CIOs** for their focus on operational efficiency

In the age of AI, driving a business forward requires balancing three very significant considerations: growth through innovation, productivity through operational efficiency, and trust through security. While AI has the potential to ignite innovation and optimize operational efficiency, it has also expanded the attack surface.

With so many considerations at play — from AI’s promises to its very real risks — we wanted to know how leaders in business are navigating the AI landscape. What are their perceptions of AI, how is AI factoring into their decisions, and do they feel prepared to leverage its capabilities and protect against its risks?

Responses from these executives offer insights into where companies across sizes, industries, and regions find themselves in today’s AI landscape and where they aim to be in the future.

### Demographics and strategic priorities

With a company’s success closely tied to its ability to spark innovation, expand security, and drive efficiency, we focused our survey on the three executive roles most closely associated with those initiatives:

- CSOs/CISOs (security)
- CTOs (innovation)
- CIOs (operational efficiency)

#### Demographics: Executives span roles, industries, and regions

We surveyed 125 global executives:
- **41%** CSO or CISO role
- **33%** CTO role

We asked executives to rank, from most to least important, the following strategic priorities: security, operational efficiency, innovation, and speed to market.

- **By Role**: CSOs/CISOs prefer security; CTOs prefer speed to market; CIOs prefer operational efficiency.
- **By Company Size**: Larger companies rank security highest. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees distribute priorities more evenly among operational efficiency, innovation, and speed to market.
