## Welcome & Synopsis

Welcome to the 10th edition of the Edgescan Vulnerability Stats Report 2025.

This report demonstrates the state of full stack security based on thousands of security assessments and penetration tests on millions of assets that were performed globally from the Edgescan Cybersecurity Platform in 2024.

This is an analysis of vulnerabilities detected in the systems of hundreds of organizations across a wide range of industries – from the Fortune 500 to medium and small businesses.

The report provides a statistical model of the most common weaknesses faced by organizations to enable data-driven decisions for managing risks and exposures more effectively.

We hope this report will provide a unique by-the-numbers insight into trends, statistics and a snapshot of the overall state of cybersecurity for the past year, from the perspective of vulnerabilities discovered and remediated, as well as penetration testing success rates.

We are proud that this yearly report has become a reliable source for approximating the global state of vulnerability management. This is exemplified by our unique dataset being part of the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), which is the de facto standard for insights into the common drivers for incidents and breaches today.

This year we delve into quantification of attack surface management exposures & risks, Mean Time To Remediate (MTTR) critical vulnerabilities and also into Risk Density, to describe where critical severity vulnerabilities and exposures are clustered in the IT technical stack.

Our statistical models are split across layers of the technology stack (i.e. Full Stack), such as Web Application, API, and Device/Host layers.

Additionally, we make a distinction in the data, highlighting if discovered known vulnerabilities (CVEs) have associated exploit code freely available.

Unfortunately, we still see high rates of known (patchable) exploitable vulnerabilities, with working exploits in the wild being used by nation states and cyber criminal groups against organizations who are slow to patch.

As Edgescan employs a number of risk prioritization scoring mechanisms, we take a deeper look at the most common risks faced by organizations and also look at correlation of the various risk scoring methodologies.

Some of the results are surprising and we hope you will stay to the end to learn more!

Given Edgescan also maps validated vulnerabilities automatically to CVSS[^1] (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), CISA KEV[^2] (Cyber Security & Infrastructure Security Agency Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalogue), EPSS[^3] (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) and our own EVSS (Edgescan Validated Security Score), we have leveraged this information to provide a qualitatively better guide to what the most common risks are, as faced by modern enterprises.

**CISA KNOWN EXPLOITED VULNERABILITIES (KEV) CATALOG CONTAINS 1,275 VULNERABILITIES. IN 2024, 320 WERE ADDED TO THE CISA KEV.**

**IN 2024, A RECORD-BREAKING 40,009 COMMON VULNERABILITIES AND EXPOSURES (CVEs) WERE PUBLISHED.**

**IN 2024, 768 CVEs WERE PUBLICLY REPORTED AS EXPLOITED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE WILD, 2% OF ALL DISCOVERED IN 2024 AND A 20% INCREASE ON 2023.**

Statistically some vulnerabilities have a very low frequency of occurrence compared to the total number of vulnerabilities discovered, but many will result in a breach with an outsized impact, which we can call an intensive rather than extensive risk.

Looking at prioritization and risk models such as EPSS, CISA KEV, CVSS & SSVC*, they are very useful in an attempt to determine areas of focus, but they vary dramatically and can’t be relied on individually.

For example, vulnerabilities may have a high CVSS score, a low EPSS score and a SSVC score of “Act”, making it difficult to prioritize issues based on one scoring system alone.

Similarly to the 2024 report, patching and maintenance is a challenge and we still find that it is not trivial to patch production systems.

The MTTR (Mean Time to Remediation) statistics also reflect on this issue. Continuous detection and assessment needs improvement and as I’ve always said, visibility is paramount.

Internal (non-public) cyber security posture is significantly lacking in terms of resilience and ease of exploit. Combining vulnerabilities across the stack, often results in the potential impact being much more severe, than the sum of the individual discovered vulnerabilities.

Oddly, CVEs dating from 2015 are still being discovered and are being used by ransomware and malware toolkits, to exploit systems when found.

Attack Surface Management (Visibility) is a key driver to cybersecurity best practices. Based on our continuous asset profiling, we have observed how common it is that sensitive and critical systems are exposed to the public Internet.

The assumption here is that enterprises simply do not have systems, people and processes in place, to make them aware of exposures in a manner that facilitates remediation actions.

This report provides a global snapshot across dozens of industry verticals and how to prioritize what is important, as not all vulnerabilities are created equal.

## Year in Review

### APPLICATION SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES VS CVEs

Understanding the relationship between data breaches, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), and application security vulnerabilities is crucial for effective cybersecurity strategies. Here is an overview based on available data.

### Application Security Vulnerabilities and Data Breaches

Here is an overview based on available data.

In the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), vulnerability exploitation was identified as the initial point of entry in 14% of all breaches, marking a significant increase from previous years.

While the report does not specify the exact percentage of breaches directly linked to application security vulnerabilities, it highlights that basic web application attacks are among the top three patterns associated with data breaches.

The report emphasizes the critical need for organizations to address vulnerabilities promptly, as delays in patching can leave systems exposed to attacks.

Implementing robust security measures, conducting regular vulnerability assessments, and ensuring timely patch management are essential steps in mitigating the risk of breaches stemming from both application and infrastructure vulnerabilities.

Application breaches, often involving stolen credentials and vulnerabilities, accounted for 25% of all breaches in 2024 based on multiple sources.

- Application breaches, often involving stolen credentials and vulnerabilities, accounted for 25% of all breaches in 2024, based on multiple sources.
- As of 31st May 2024, approximately 6% of all published CVEs had been exploited in the wild
- The average CVSS score for CISA KEV listed vulnerabilities, was 8.4
- 53% of scored CVEs discovered in 2024 were of High and Critical Severity

### CVEs and Data Breaches

Unpatched vulnerabilities, many of which are catalogued as CVEs, have been implicated in a significant number of data breaches. One report suggests that unpatched vulnerabilities were involved in 60% of data breaches.

### Key Considerations

- **Exploitation Rates**: Not all CVEs are exploited in the wild. The exploitation rate is relatively low compared to the total number of published CVEs. However, when exploited, they can lead to significant security incidents.
- **Importance of Patching**: Unpatched vulnerabilities, whether they are application-specific or broader system flaws, pose substantial risks. Regularly updating and patching systems is essential to mitigate these threats.

This report is based the dataset of all vulnerabilities found by the Edgescan platform in 2024.

## How does edgescan measure Security?

Edgescan discovers and validates all exposures and vulnerabilities to remove false positives, false alarms and make our users lives a little easier. The data in this report is based on thousands of penetration tests and continuous scans across hundreds of organizations globally.

1.  **Risk Analytics**

    Edgescan employs advanced risk analytics to prioritize vulnerabilities based on the level of risk they pose to an organization. This helps in focusing remediation efforts on the most critical issues first.

2.  **Human Touch**

    In some cases, vulnerabilities cannot be validated or confirmed using automation. This may be due to complexity, the multi-step nature of the exploit or a business contextual exposure. Edgescan uses our team of experts to ensure high and critical severity vulnerabilities are real. There is nothing more disruptive than receiving a critical severity alert based on a false positive.

3.  **Data-Driven Decisions**

    By analyzing historical data and trends, Edgescan provides insights into the most common vulnerabilities and their impact. This data-driven approach helps organizations make informed decisions about their security posture.

4.  **Continuous Monitoring**

    Edgescan continuously monitors the security environment to identify new vulnerabilities and changes in the exposure landscape.

### Smart Vulnerability Management™

![Diagram illustrating the Smart Vulnerability Management process. It shows a continuous feedback loop between "Automated Validation", "Expert Validation", and "Data Lake". Automated Validation utilizes analytics to query millions of vulnerability examples from the data lake and determines if a discovered vulnerability is a true positive, deciding whether to automatically commit or flag for expert validation. Expert Validation is required for Critical or High Severity vulnerabilities, PCI Fails, or when confidence intervals are outside Edgescan Risk Parameters, performed by qualified experts. Both automated and expert validation results (true and false positives) are fed into the Data Lake to optimize automated validation accuracy.](Image description)

**8% HUMAN**

## Vulnerability Severity
### EPSS, CISA KEV, EVSS & EXF

### What is EPSS?

The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is an open, data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. The EPSS model produces a probability score between 0 and 1 (0 and 100%). The higher the score, the greater the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited.

https://www.first.org/epss/

### What is CISA KEV?

CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild: the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog. CISA strongly recommends all organizations review and monitor the KEV catalog and prioritize remediation of the listed vulnerabilities to reduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.

https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities

### Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS)

Every vulnerability discovered by Edgescan is validated via a combination of advanced “big-data” analytics and human expertise, resulting in near false positive-free vulnerability intelligence. Once a vulnerability is validated is it mapped to both the CISA KEV and EPSS to assist with prioritization. All vulnerabilities in Edgescan (where applicable) have an EPSS, CISA KEV, CVSS and EVSS risk score.

https://www.edgescan.com/solutions/risk-based-vulnerability-management-rbvm/

### Edgescan eXposure Factor (EXF)

The Edgescan eXposure Factor combines EPSS, CVSS, CISA KEV and EVSS to reach a simple priority score which, taken in relevance with other vulnerabilities, provides a simple way to prioritize discovered and validated vulnerabilities.

https://www.edgescan.com/edgescan-exposure-factor-exf/

### What is Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC)?

CISA uses its own SSVC decision tree model to prioritize relevant vulnerabilities into four possible decisions. Edgescan has mapped:

- **Track**: The vulnerability does not require action at this time.
- **Track***: The vulnerability contains specific characteristics that may require closer monitoring for changes.
- **Attend**: The vulnerability requires attention from the organization’s internal, supervisory-level individuals.
- **Act**: The vulnerability requires attention from the organization’s internal, supervisory-level and leadership-level individuals.

## Risk Density

The following is a breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity, discovered across the full stack; Web Applications, APIs and Network/Host deployments.

It also depicts the risks associated with potential PCI (Payment Card Industry) failures – not every vulnerability results in a PCI fail.

Severity is defined via the Edgescan Validated Security Score (EVSS). Later in the report we draw upon CVSS, CISA KEV and EPSS Risk and Probability scores.

### SEVERITY DISPERSION ACROSS THE FULL STACK (NETWORK, WEB, API COMBINED)

- **11% CRITICAL**
- **22% HIGH**
- **44% MEDIUM**
- **8% LOW**
- **15% INFO**

**ACROSS THE FULL STACK MORE THAN 33% OF DISCOVERED VULNERABILITIES WERE OF A CRITICAL OR HIGH SEVERITY**

**SEVERITY IS BASED ON EDGESCAN EVSS (EDGESCAN VALIDATED VULNERABILITY SCORE)**

**EVSS IS APPLIED TO WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITIES AND IS BASED UPON LIKELIHOOD & IMPACT WHEN A VULNERABILITY IS UNDERGOING VALIDATION, ADDRESSING QUESTIONS SUCH AS EXPLOITABILITY, IMPACT AND LIKELIHOOD**

### How EVSS Works

1.  **Automated Scanning**: The platform continuously scans your digital assets for vulnerabilities using various tools and techniques.
2.  **Data Science & Human Validation**: Analytics is used to estimate the confidence interval of a vulnerability and whether it is a true or false positive. This is based on comparison with millions of previously validated vulnerabilities to get an accurate estimate. Security experts review the automated findings, specifically High and Critical Severity issues, to eliminate false positives and ensure accuracy.
3.  **Risk-Based Data**: Each vulnerability is assessed using multiple risk-based data points, including:
    -   EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System): Predicts the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited
    -   CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerability catalogue): Identifies vulnerabilities that are known to be exploited in the wild
    -   CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System): Provides a standardized severity score
    -   EXF: The above scores are combined and weighted to produce the Edgescan eXposure Factor (EXF) to assist with prioritization decisions

### Benefits of EVSS

-   **Prioritization**: Helps you focus on the most critical vulnerabilities first, improving your security posture efficiently
-   **Accuracy**: Reduces the noise of false positives, allowing your team to concentrate on real threats
-   **Efficiency**: Speeds up the remediation process by providing clear, actionable intelligence
-   **Comprehensive Coverage**: Integrates with various security solutions to offer full-stack vulnerability management

## Risk Density – Network/Host

### NETWORK/HOST VULNERABILITY DISPERSION BY SEVERITY

- **8.9% CRITICAL**
- **23.3% HIGH**
- **43.1% MEDIUM**
- **6% LOW**
- **19% INFO** (Inferred from the pie chart, as the sum of the others is 81.3%)

**32.2% OF DISCOVERED VULNERABILITIES IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE/HOSTING/CLOUD/NETWORK LAYER WERE OF A CRITICAL OR HIGH SEVERITY**

**19% HAD AN EPSS SCORE ABOVE 0.8 (PROBABILITY OF BREACH EXCEEDING 80%)**

**EPSS SCORES ARE DYNAMIC AND CHANGE OVER TIME. THE EPSS SCORES DEPICTED ARE AT TIME OF PUBLICATION (10TH JANUARY 2025)**

The most common vulnerabilities with an EPSS score above 0.7 are listed here

**OPEN SSL/CRYPTOGRAPHIC ISSUES REMAIN THE MOST COMMON**

## Risk Density – Application/API

### WEB APPLICATION & API (LAYER 7) VULNERABILITY DISPERSION BY SEVERITY

- **9% CRITICAL**
- **5.8% HIGH**
- **32% MEDIUM**
- **53.2% LOW**

**ACROSS THE WEB APPLICATION AND API LAYERS 14.8% OF DISCOVERED VULNERABILITIES WERE OF A CRITICAL OR HIGH SEVERITY. AS DEPICTED LATER IN THIS DOCUMENT CRITICAL AND HIGH SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES REMAIN VERY SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS YEARS**

**VULNERABILITIES SUCH AS SQL INJECTION (CWE-89) ARE READILY DISCOVERED AND ACCOUNT FOR 19.52% OF ALL CRITICAL AND HIGH SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES**

**VULNERABILITIES SUCH AS MALICIOUS FILE UPLOAD ARE NOT TESTED ADEQUATELY USING AUTOMATION AND ARE FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED BY SCANNING SOLUTIONS DUE TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TEST CASES**

![Bar chart showing the percentage of total for the Top 10 High & Critical Severity vulnerabilities.](Image description)

### The Top 10 – High & Critical Severity

| % of Total | CWE     | Name                                     |
| :--------- | :------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| 28.28%     | CWE-89  | SQL injection                            |
| 13.56%     | CWE-434 | Malicious File Upload                    |
| 10.80%     | CWE-79  | Cross-Site Scripting XSS (Stored)        |
| 6.21%      | CWE-79  | Cross-Site Scripting XSS (Reflected)     |
| 5.06%      | CWE-306 | API Accessible without Authentication    |
| 4.83%      | CWE-307 | Brute Forcing Weakness                   |
| 4.14%      | CWE-639 | Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) - API |
| 3.68%      | CWE-703 | Error Handling                           |
| 3.45%      | CWE-284 | Broken Access Control                    |
| 3.45%      | CWE-200 | Sensitive File(s) Disclosure             |

The Top 10 depicts the most common Critical and High Severity issues discovered by Edgescan over the past year. SQL Injection is still the main contender (as was in the 2024 report), which is interesting to note as we can easily develop code (or block vectors) to mitigate such attacks. Detection of such vulnerabilities is also trivial using the correct techniques.

Something which is overlooked quite frequently is “malicious file upload” at 9.37% of all High and Critical Severity vulnerabilities discovered. This can give rise to ransomware, malware and internal network breach pivot points for attackers.

API security weaknesses are also significant with Authentication and IDOR issues at 5% and 2.9% respectively.

| Insufficient Business-Logic Authorization     | 3%         |
| Multistep Malicious File Upload               | 3%         |

### Automated vs Hybrid web application security assessments

Automated scanning is a powerful approach for identifying vulnerabilities in software systems, but it has limitations:

- Additionally, automated scans may not fully cover all aspects of a system, especially if the system is highly customized or uses obscure technologies.
- Firstly, automated scanners rely on predefined rules and signatures, which means they can miss novel or unique vulnerabilities that have not been documented yet.
- Secondly, these tools often struggle with complex logic flaws or business logic vulnerabilities that require human intuition and understanding to detect.
- False positives and false negatives are also common, leading to either missed vulnerabilities or unnecessary alerts. Moreover, automated tools cannot assess the context or impact of a vulnerability in the same way a skilled security professional can.

Finally, attackers are constantly evolving their techniques, and automated tools may lag behind in recognizing new methods of exploitation.

Therefore, while automation is a valuable component of a comprehensive security strategy, it should be complemented by manual reviews and expert analysis to ensure thorough vulnerability detection.

## Payment Card Industry (PCI) Failures

PCI Failures By Severity – Issues which will result in a failed compliance scan. PCI affected assets must pass 4 quarterly scans per year in order to be compliant with the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

- **9% CRITICAL**
- **23% HIGH**
- **67% MEDIUM**
- **2% LOW** (Inferred from the pie chart, as the sum of the others is 99%)

**32% OF PCI FAILURES WERE OF HIGH & CRITICAL SEVERITY**

**RESEARCH INDICATES THAT MANY PCI FAILURES HAVE A VERY LOW CHANCE OF BEING EXPLOITED GIVEN THEY ARE NOT ON THE CISA KEV AND HAVE A LOW EPSS SCORE, ALBEIT THEY RESULT IN A PCI DSS COMPLIANCE FAIL**

### Most Common PCI Fails
