## Executive summary

Welcome to IBM’s annual Cost of a Data Breach Report. With this edition, we mark 20 years of data breach research. This year, we set our sights on the most fundamental technological shift in a generation: the adoption of AI.

With the 2025 report, we begin chronicling and quantifying the risks associated with AI. What we’ve found is concerning: organizations are skipping over security and governance for AI in favor of do-it-now AI adoption. Those ungoverned systems are more likely to be breached—and more costly when they are. We’re not surprised.

Since 2005, this report has tracked an ever expanding technology landscape and the threats that follow it. Our research partners at Ponemon Institute have not only documented the emergence of new threats and attack surfaces, but also quantified these threats in financial terms security and business leaders can understand and act on. All told, their researchers have studied more than 6,485 breaches and interviewed over 34,652 technology, security and business leaders involved in their organization’s response to the breach.

Obviously, security threats have changed through the years. Two decades ago, nearly half of all data breaches (45%) were caused by a lost or stolen computing device, such as a laptop or thumb drive, while only 10% of breaches were attributed to “hacked electronic systems.” Today, most breaches are caused by a range of malicious activities, from phishing to insider threats.

Ten years ago, breaches due to cloud misconfiguration weren’t even a categorized threat. Today, the cloud and the data in it are a prime target. And it was only during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 that ransomware began to surge. A year later, those attacks accounted for an average USD 4.62 million in breach costs, a figure that hit USD 5.08 million in this year’s report.

However, one constant has been the work of Ponemon. This year’s research—conducted independently by Ponemon Institute and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM—studied 600 organizations impacted by data breaches between March 2024 and February 2025. Together, we looked at organizations across 17 industries, in 16 countries and regions, and breaches that ranged from 2,960 to 113,620 compromised records. To gain on-the-ground insights, Ponemon researchers interviewed 3,470 security and C-suite business leaders with firsthand knowledge of the data breach incidents at their organizations. These leaders included CEOs, CISOs, heads of operations, controllers or heads of finance, IT practitioners, business unit leaders and general managers, and risk management and cybersecurity practitioners.

The result is a benchmark report that business, technology and security leaders can use to strengthen their defenses, inform resource allocation and drive innovation, particularly around securing and governing their AI initiatives.

This year’s headline: global data breach costs have declined for the first time in five years, dropping to USD 4.44 million, due to faster breach containment that was driven by AI-powered defenses. But as defenders move smarter and faster, so do attackers—16% of breaches reportedly involved attackers using AI, often used in phishing and deepfake attacks. While this escalating AI arms race has benefitted organizations by pushing global breach costs lower, the US is bucking the trend. Breach costs there have surged past USD 10 million, driven by steeper regulatory penalties and rising detection costs.

We also found AI adoption is outpacing oversight. We found 97% of AI-related security breaches involved AI systems that lacked proper access controls. And most breached organizations reported they have no governance policies in place to manage AI or prevent shadow AI—the use of AI without employer approval or oversight. Both the covert use of shadow AI and the lack of governance are driving up breach costs.

## What’s new

As always, the Cost of a Data Breach Report reflects new technologies, emerging tactics and recent events. For the first time, this year’s research explores the:

- State of security and governance for AI
- Prevalence and risk profile of shadow AI
- Type of data targeted in security incidents involving AI
- Length of breach disruptions to organizations
- Cost savings from using quantum security tools
- Breach costs associated with AI-driven attacks
- Amount of breach costs passed on to customers

## Key findings

**USD 4.44M**
The global average cost of a data breach

**USD 670K**
Added breach cost for shadow AI

**49%**
Share of organizations investing in security post breach

The key findings described here are based on IBM analysis of research data independently compiled by Ponemon Institute.

The global average breach cost dropped to USD 4.44 million from USD 4.88 million in 2024, a 9% decrease and a return to 2023 cost levels. Faster identification and containment of breaches—much of it from organizations’ own security and security service teams, with help from AI and automation—drove this decline. The global average would have been lower were it not for the United States, where the average cost surged by 9% to USD 10.22 million, an all-time high for any region. Higher regulatory fines and higher detection and escalation costs in the United States contributed to this surge.

Among the organizations studied this year, 20% said they suffered a breach due to security incidents involving shadow AI. For organizations with high levels of shadow AI, those breaches added USD 670,000 to the average breach price tag compared to those that had low levels of shadow AI or none. These incidents also resulted in more personal identifiable information (65%) and intellectual property (40%) data being compromised. And that data was most often stored across multiple environments, revealing just one unmonitored AI system can lead to widespread exposure. The swift rise of shadow AI has displaced security skills shortages as one of the top three costly breach factors tracked by this report.

There was a significant reduction in the number of organizations that plan to invest in security following a breach, 49% this year compared to 63% last year. Less than half of those who plan to invest in a security plan to focus on AI-driven security solutions or services, such as threat detection and response, incident response (IR) planning and testing, and data security or protection tools.

**97%**
Share of organizations that reported an AI-related breach and lacked proper AI access controls

Security incidents involving an organization’s AI remain limited—for now. On average, 13% of organizations reported breaches that involved their AI models or applications. However, among those that did,
