## Executive summary

Welcome to IBM’s annual Cost of a Data Breach Report. With this edition, we mark 20 years of data breach research. This year, we set our sights on the most fundamental technological shift in a generation: the adoption of AI.

With the 2025 report, we begin chronicling and quantifying the risks associated with AI. What we’ve found is concerning: organizations are skipping over security and governance for AI in favor of do-it-now AI adoption. Those ungoverned systems are more likely to be breached—and more costly when they are. We’re not surprised.

Since 2005, this report has tracked an ever expanding technology landscape and the threats that follow it. Our research partners at Ponemon Institute have not only documented the emergence of new threats and attack surfaces, but also quantified these threats in financial terms security and business leaders can understand and act on. All told, their researchers have studied more than 6,485 breaches and interviewed over 34,652 technology, security and business leaders involved in their organization’s response to the breach.

Obviously, security threats have changed through the years. Two decades ago, nearly half of all data breaches (45%) were caused by a lost or stolen computing device, such as a laptop or thumb drive, while only 10% of breaches were attributed to “hacked electronic systems.” Today, most breaches are caused by a range of malicious activities, from phishing to insider threats.

Ten years ago, breaches due to cloud misconfiguration weren’t even a categorized threat. Today, the cloud and the data in it are a prime target. And it was only during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 that ransomware began to surge. A year later, those attacks accounted for an average USD 4.62 million in breach costs, a figure that hit USD 5.08 million in this year’s report.

However, one constant has been the work of Ponemon. This year’s research—conducted independently by Ponemon Institute and sponsored, analyzed and published by IBM—studied 600 organizations impacted by data breaches between March 2024 and February 2025. Together, we looked at organizations across 17 industries, in 16 countries and regions, and breaches that ranged from 2,960 to 113,620 compromised records. To gain on-the-ground insights, Ponemon researchers interviewed 3,470 security and C-suite business leaders with firsthand knowledge of the data breach incidents at their organizations. These leaders included CEOs, CISOs, heads of operations, controllers or heads of finance, IT practitioners, business unit leaders and general managers, and risk management and cybersecurity practitioners.

The result is a benchmark report that business, technology and security leaders can use to strengthen their defenses, inform resource allocation and drive innovation, particularly around securing and governing their AI initiatives.

This year’s headline: global data breach costs have declined for the first time in five years, dropping to USD 4.44 million, due to faster breach containment that was driven by AI-powered defenses. But as defenders move smarter and faster, so do attackers—16% of breaches reportedly involved attackers using AI, often used in phishing and deepfake attacks. While this escalating AI arms race has benefitted organizations by pushing global breach costs lower, the US is bucking the trend. Breach costs there have surged past USD 10 million, driven by steeper regulatory penalties and rising detection costs.

We also found AI adoption is outpacing oversight. We found 97% of AI-related security breaches involved AI systems that lacked proper access controls. And most breached organizations reported they have no governance policies in place to manage AI or prevent shadow AI—the use of AI without employer approval or oversight. Both the covert use of shadow AI and the lack of governance are driving up breach costs.

## What’s new

As always, the Cost of a Data Breach Report reflects new technologies, emerging tactics and recent events. For the first time, this year’s research explores the:

- State of security and governance for AI
- Prevalence and risk profile of shadow AI
- Type of data targeted in security incidents involving AI
- Length of breach disruptions to organizations
- Cost savings from using quantum security tools
- Breach costs associated with AI-driven attacks
- Amount of breach costs passed on to customers

## Key findings

The key findings described here are based on IBM analysis of research data independently compiled by Ponemon Institute.

**USD 4.44M**
The global average cost of a data breach

The global average breach cost dropped to USD 4.44 million from USD 4.88 million in 2024, a 9% decrease and a return to 2023 cost levels. Faster identification and containment of breaches—much of it from organizations’ own security and security service teams, with help from AI and automation—drove this decline. The global average would have been lower were it not for the United States, where the average cost surged by 9% to USD 10.22 million, an all-time high for any region. Higher regulatory fines and higher detection and escalation costs in the United States contributed to this surge.

**USD 670K**
Added breach cost for shadow AI

Among the organizations studied this year, 20% said they suffered a breach due to security incidents involving shadow AI. For organizations with high levels of shadow AI, those breaches added USD 670,000 to the average breach price tag compared to those that had low levels of shadow AI or none. These incidents also resulted in more personal identifiable information (65%) and intellectual property (40%) data being compromised. And that data was most often stored across multiple environments, revealing just one unmonitored AI system can lead to widespread exposure. The swift rise of shadow AI has displaced security skills shortages as one of the top three costly breach factors tracked by this report.

**49%**
Share of organizations investing in security post breach

There was a significant reduction in the number of organizations that plan to invest in security following a breach, 49% this year compared to 63% last year. Less than half of those who plan to invest in a security plan to focus on AI-driven security solutions or services, such as threat detection and response, incident response (IR) planning and testing, and data security or protection tools.

**97%**
Share of organizations that reported an AI-related breach and lacked proper AI access controls

Security incidents involving an organization’s AI remain limited—for now. On average, 13% of organizations reported breaches that involved their AI models or applications. However, among those that did, almost all (97%) lacked proper AI access controls. The most common of these security incidents occurred in the AI supply chain, through compromised apps, APIs or plug-ins. These incidents had a ripple effect: they led to broad data compromise (60%) and operational disruption (31%). The findings suggest AI is emerging as a high-value target.

**USD 1.9M**
Cost savings from extensive use of AI in security

Security teams using AI and automation extensively shortened their breach times by 80 days and lowered their average breach costs by USD 1.9 million compared to organizations that didn’t use these solutions. Nearly a third of organizations said they used these tools extensively across the security lifecycle—in prevention, detection, investigation and response. However, that figure is up only slightly from the previous year, suggesting AI adoption may have stalled. It also shows the majority are still not using AI and automation and, therefore, aren’t seeing the cost benefits.

**63%**
Share of organizations that lack AI governance policies

A majority of breached organizations (63%) either don’t have an AI governance policy or are still developing one. Even when they have a policy, less than half have an approval process for AI deployments, and 61% lack AI governance technologies. Among organizations that have governance polices in place, only a minority (34%) perform regular audits for unsanctioned AI. It shows AI remains largely unchecked as adoption outpaces both security and governance.

**USD 4.92M**
Average cost of malicious insider attacks

For the second year in a row, malicious insider attacks resulted in the highest average breach costs among initial threat vectors: USD 4.92 million. Third-party vendor and supply chain compromise followed closely at USD 4.91 million. Other expensive attack vectors included vulnerability exploitation and phishing. However, the most frequent type of attack vector on organizations was phishing, at 16%, which averaged USD 4.8 million.

**63%**
Share of organizations that refused to pay ransomware attackers

More ransomware victims refused to pay a ransom in 2025 (63%) than 2024 (59%). However, the average cost of an extortion or ransomware incident remains high, particularly when disclosed by an attacker (USD 5.08 million). At the same time, fewer ransomware victims reported involving law enforcement—40% of organizations this year versus 53% last year.

**1 in 6**
Number of breaches involving AI-driven attacks

Attackers can use generative AI (gen AI) to both perfect and scale their phishing campaigns and other social engineering attacks. IBM previously found gen AI reduced the time needed to craft a convincing phishing email from 16 hours down to only five minutes. This year’s report shows the impact: on average, 16% of data breaches involved attackers using AI, most often for AI-generated phishing (37%) and deepfake impersonation attacks (35%).

## Global highlights

While the cybersecurity skill shortage continues to grow, security teams are managing to identify and contain beaches faster, with the help of AI and automation. That approach is helping drive down data breach costs globally. These teams are doing so even as attackers use gen AI to create and scale realistic phishing and deepfake attacks. Despite the overall global decrease, the United States saw breach costs rise, driven by higher regulatory fines and increased detection and escalation costs. Healthcare continues to top the list of costliest industries for breaches. The following section provides a look at these and other issues across industries, countries and regions.

### The global average cost of a data breach fell

For the first time in five years, the global average cost of a data breach dropped, reaching USD 4.44 million. Globally, shorter breach investigations are pushing down detection and escalation costs, which can include assessment and audits, crisis management, and communications to executive leadership and boards. See Figure 1.

![Figure 1. Bar chart showing global average cost of a data breach in USD millions from 2018 to 2025. Costs are: 2018: 3.86, 2019: 3.92, 2020: 3.86, 2021: 4.24, 2022: 4.35, 2023: 4.44, 2024: 4.88, 2025: 4.45.](images/image2.png)

### The United States breaks a breach cost record

Average breach costs in the United States reached a record USD 10.22 million, a 9% increase over last year, driven in part by higher regulatory fines and detection and escalation costs. Most countries or regions recorded a decrease, due to lower detection and escalation costs. Some places, such as Saudi Arabia, were likely assisted by increased security spending and maturing security frameworks. Among the decliners were Italy (-27%), Germany (-24%) and South Korea (-21.5%). On the increase list were Canada, India, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Benelux—the economic union of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Benelux made its debut in the 2024 study and witnessed a 6% increase in average breach cost. See Figure 2.

![Figure 2. Table showing average data breach costs by country/region for 2025 and 2024, measured in USD millions.

### Healthcare remained the most expensive industry for breaches

At USD 7.42 million, healthcare recorded the highest average breach cost among industries for the 14th consecutive year—even as it saw a sharp reduction from last year (USD 9.77 million). Attackers continue to value and target the industry’s patient personal identification information (PII), which can be used for identity theft, insurance fraud and other financial crimes. Healthcare breaches took the longest to identify and contain at 279 days. That’s more than five weeks longer than the global average. See Figure 3.

![Figure 3. Bar chart showing average data breach costs by industry for 2025 and 2024, measured in USD millions.

### Time to identify and contain a breach decreased

The mean time organizations took to identify and contain a breach fell to 241 days, reaching a nine-year low and continuing a downward trend that started after a 287-day peak in 2021. As noted in last year’s report, security teams continue to improve their mean time to identify (MTTI) and mean time to contain (MTTC) with the help of AI-driven and automation-driven defenses. See Figure 4.

### Detection and escalation costs plunged

Average costs for detection and escalation fell to USD 1.47 million, a nearly 10% drop from last year. These costs were the top decliners among four cost categories. Still, the other three categories—notification, ex-post response and lost business costs—also fell. Lost business, which includes revenue from system downtime, lost customers and reputation damage, dropped 6% after an 11% surge last year that helped drive total breach costs higher. See Figure 5.

### Most breaches targeted customer PII

Attackers targeted customer PII over other types of data by a wide margin. At 53%, it was the most stolen or compromised data type. Customer PII can include tax identity (ID) numbers, emails and home addresses, and can be used in identity theft and credit card fraud. On the other hand, company intellectual property (IP), while less commonly stolen or compromised, was the most costly (USD 178 per record). See Figure 6.

![Figure 6. Bar chart showing the percentage of breaches targeting different data types and their cost per record in USD for 2025 and 2024.
Intellectual property: 2025: 33%, $178; 2024: 37%, $189
Employee PII: 2025: 43%, $173; 2024: 37%, $168
Customer PII: 2025: 53%, $160; 2024: 46%, $179

## Data security

Data can be vulnerable wherever it’s stored. Last year, most breaches involved data distributed across multiple environments, such as public clouds, private clouds and on premises. That finding remained true this year, but the share of those breaches fell, while the share of breaches involving data stored solely on premises grew. Meanwhile, the average costs associated with each location type was drastically different.

### The effect of storage location on cost and frequency of a data breach

30% of all breaches involved data distributed across multiple environments, down from 40% last year. Meanwhile, breaches involving data stored on premises increased sharply to 28% from 20% last year. However, costs for each category differed. Data breaches involving multiple environments cost an average USD 5.05 million, while data breached on premises cost an average USD 4.01 million. See Figure 7.

![Figure 7. Bar chart showing the percentage of breaches and average cost in USD millions by data storage location for 2025 and 2024.
Across multiple types of environments: 2025: 30%, $5.05; 2024: 40%, $5.03
On premises: 2025: 28%, $4.01; 2024: 20%, $4.18
