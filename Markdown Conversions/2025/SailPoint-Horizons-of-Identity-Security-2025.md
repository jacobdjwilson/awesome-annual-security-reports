The Horizons of
Identity Security

Adapt or risk falling behind:
How to keep up as identity shifts from
foundational control to security frontier

2025-2026

## Executive summary

Identity has become the enterprise’s nerve center, coordinating access,
powering automation, and enabling real-time decisions and threat
management across systems and users—both human and non-human. In
2025, identity sits at the center of digital transformation, enabling secure growth,
operational agility, and intelligent automation. At the same time, the identity
paradigm is rapidly shifting, from single point of control to method of detection,
prevention mechanism to response enabler, and static policy enforcement to
dynamic privilege adjustment. In this way, the role of identity has fundamentally
changed, from foundational control to the new frontier of security.

As identity security and the attack landscape evolve rapidly, especially with the
proliferation of machine and AI agent identities, organizations need to adopt
new and emerging identity capabilities just to keep up. However, our research
reveals a widening gap between mature organizations that use automation
and AI-enabled identity solutions to unlock measurable business value, and
the majority, who have less mature and cumbersome access processes, held
back by slow deployment, poor data integration, and limited automation.
Organizations also face growing challenges in identifying and governing the
full spectrum of identity types, from traditional human users to increasingly
complex machine identities and AI agents, which often operate with limited
visibility and fragmented ownership. This is all made more difficult by the need
to scale management of identities across multiple cloud environments.

Despite challenges faced, organizations report that identity provides the
greatest return on investment when compared to all other security domains.
Twice as many organizations ranked Identity and Access Management (IAM)
as their highest-ROI domain compared to the average (Exhibit 1). This is
because effective identity management does more than reduce risk. It drives
efficiency, accelerates transformation, and enables smarter decisions across
the enterprise.

IAM is at 30%, followed by Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) at 22%, Data security at 13%, Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) at 12%, Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) at 10%, Network security/perimeter at 8%, and Application security at 5%.]

Over the last four years, SailPoint has surveyed IAM decision-makers across the
globe to assess their capabilities across identity security horizons and define the
future of identity. The 375 decision-makers we surveyed in June 2025 included
senior leaders in information technology, cybersecurity, and risk. More than half
work for organizations with over 10,000 employees, and the majority represent the
finance, technology, and healthcare sectors. (For details on survey demographics,
see the appendix.)

Using their responses, we grouped their organizations into five horizons based on
strategy, talent, operating model, and technology capabilities:

- At Horizon 1, the lowest maturity, organizations lack the strategy and technology
  to enable digital identities
- At Horizon 2, they have adopted some identity technology but still rely heavily on
  manual processes
- At Horizon 3, they have adopted identity capabilities at scale
- At Horizon 4, they have automated capabilities at scale and use AI to enhance
  digital identities
- At Horizon 5, the closest to the future of identity, boundaries are blurred between
  enterprise identity controls and the external identity ecosystem, and identity
  supports the business in next-gen technology innovations

The most significant shift this year has been the introduction of new capability
requirements for Horizons 4 and 5, specifically cloud infrastructure entitlement
management to secure increasingly distributed multi-cloud environments and
new capabilities to govern AI agents, reflecting the accelerating adoption of AI
within organizations.

### What we found
This year’s research highlights four critical themes from our 2025 survey of
global identity leaders. Together, they reflect where organizations stand today,
where progress is being made, and what continues to hold many teams back.

#### 1. Organizations are falling behind as the attack landscape intensifies, AI agents proliferate, and the bar for mature identity security rises

For every three organizations that moved forward, two moved backward,
despite rising levels of identity security investment overall.

- 63 percent of organizations remain in Horizons 1 or 2, suggesting a
  significant opportunity to unlock the “full potential” of identity security.
  These programs are typically tactical, manually driven, and limited in
  their ability to support automation, AI governance, or cross-environment
  controls. However, many of these organizations are now focused on building
  foundational capabilities that will enable future scale.
- Advancement to Horizons 3 and 4+ was driven by an increased appetite to
  automate to reduce costs and new capability building. In particular, Horizon
  4 organizations this year had higher adoption across ID verification, machine
  identity management, and AI agent IAM.
- Four percent of organizations regressed in 2025. This was not due to
  declining effort, but rather a result of rising capability thresholds to meet
  Horizons 4 and 5 as the attack landscape intensifies. Organizations that
  regressed had significantly lower adoption of AI agent IAM capabilities.

#### 2. Organizations that adopt advanced AI and identity data capabilities see significantly higher cost savings, productivity, and risk reduction

Outperforming organizations are adopting emerging AI and data capabilities
at the intersection of identity, data, and security to keep up with the evolving
attack landscape.

- Use of emerging identity data capabilities is a key enabler of downstream
  business use cases. Horizon 3+ organizations are four to eight times more
  likely to have real-time identity data synchronization, entity resolution, and
  automated lifecycle workflows compared to earlier-stage peers.
- AI is being deployed to manage identity at scale, as mature organizations
  use identity not just as a control but also as a detection mechanism.
  Adoption of AI-enabled detection capabilities, such as Identity Threat
  Detection and Response (ITDR) and privileged account monitoring, is 4 times
  as high among mature organizations than those in Horizons 1-2.
- Identity cloud data governance is maturing, although adoption of cloud
  data access controls is higher than for harder to achieve context-aware
  access models. Mature organizations are 4.5 times more likely to have cloud
  data governance capabilities such as unified policy enforcement and real-
  time data access monitoring. However, adoption of context-aware access
  capabilities such as attribute-based access control (ABAC) and ephemeral
  access models — temporary, time-bound permissions granted only when
  needed — trails behind, highlighting the opportunity to mature towards
  dynamic and just-in-time access.

#### 3. Deployment is a critical unlock in moving across horizons, and many get it wrong

Despite rising levels of investment, many identity programs still struggle with
inconsistent deployment execution; however, mature organizations follow
customer success best practices to advance across horizons.

- Deployment holds some organizations back from being able to fully
  onboard emerging capabilities, but implementing horizon-specific
  best practices enables advancement. Many organizations report IAM
  deployments that ran over budget, were delayed, or did not meaningfully
  improve user experience. However, organizations employing horizon-specific
  best practices outperformed across all critical business outcomes.
- Effective management of application onboarding complexity is a universal
  customer success challenge for organizations across horizons. Application
  onboarding is especially challenging for H4+ organizations, who have
  distributed and complex environments with 3.6 times as many applications
  in their estate when compared to H1-H3 organizations. However, use of risk-
  based sequencing and reusable templates leads to better outcomes for
  organizations across horizons.
- Identity data hygiene is a critical enabler of deployment success. While 44
  percent of Horizon 4+ organizations still report gaps in identity data quality
  or normalization, organizations that prioritized and performed data cleanup
  before migration were 1.6 times more likely to be completely successful in
  their IAM tool deployment.

#### 4. Organizations need to quantify the full value of identity to secure funding for advanced capabilities, including margin, compliance, and risk impact

Although identity enables the business through cost savings and productivity
improvements, many organizations still struggle to quantify and communicate
this impact, focusing only on compliance enablement and risk reduction.

- Only 25 percent of organizations position IAM as a strategic business
  enabler. 57 percent of organizations still describe IAM as either a
  “security control” or “compliance requirement,” limiting the role it plays in
  transformation initiatives.
- Organizations that quantify revenue and cost impact of identity
  investments are better positioned to seek increased funding. Organizations
  have traditionally quantified returns from identity security in terms of risk
  reduction and compliance enablement. However, those that quantify margin
  impact from identity security investment as well create more compelling
  business cases for increased funding.
- Integrated identity data unlocks downstream automation and new
  business use cases. When embedded into platforms like Human Resources
  (HR), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), or IT Service Management
  (ITSM), identity data powers AI assistant personalization, smarter
  provisioning, and more efficient business workflows across departments.
- Use of advanced identity security capabilities reduces risk through
  improved incident response. Identity-enabled threat detection and
  response, next-generation PAM, unified control planes, and AI agent
  governance lead to faster and more effective detection, containment, and
  remediation of incidents.

### Why it matters
Identity is now central to how organizations operate. It connects people, systems, and data while
enabling secure, automated decisions at scale, and plays a growing role in detecting and containing
threats. But while its importance is widely recognized, many organizations are not keeping pace.

Too often, identity security investments fall short of their potential. Programs sometimes stall during
deployment. IAM platforms are fragmented across teams or deprioritized entirely due to complexity,
limited expertise, or unclear ownership. As a result, impact remains siloed in IT.

However, this gap can be closed. Our research explores how organizations are making identity work in
practice — deploying solutions more effectively, building the right foundations, and turning investment
into measurable business impact.

## Chapter 1: The future of identity is tightly linked with data and security

As organizations mature across identity security horizons, the landscape they must navigate is evolving
faster than ever. In 2025, advances in AI, data management, and threat detection are reshaping identity
security. As identity shifts from a foundational control to the new frontier of security, it has emerged as
the central control point in outperforming organizations - where critical decisions are made, policies
are enforced, and security operations converge. Identity now serves as the connective tissue across
the security ecosystem, touching every domain from endpoint protection to cloud security (Exhibit 2).
This strategic positioning powers expanded governance across all human and non-human identities,
dynamic privileged access, unified and accurate visibility across environments, and automated threat
response capabilities not possible without identity telemetry. These elements are shaping the future
of integrated identity security, bringing together identity, data, and security. As integrated programs
become essential to harness identity as a dynamic method for detection and response, identity, CISO,
data, and AI organizations will have to come together to chart a singular path forward.
