## Executive summary

Identity has become the enterprise’s nerve center, coordinating access,
powering automation, and enabling real-time decisions and threat
management across systems and users—both human and non-human. In
2025, identity sits at the center of digital transformation, enabling secure growth,
operational agility, and intelligent automation. At the same time, the identity
paradigm is rapidly shifting, from single point of control to method of detection,
prevention mechanism to response enabler, and static policy enforcement to
dynamic privilege adjustment. In this way, the role of identity has fundamentally
changed, from foundational control to the new frontier of security.

As identity security and the attack landscape evolve rapidly, especially with the
proliferation of machine and AI agent identities, organizations need to adopt
new and emerging identity capabilities just to keep up. However, our research
reveals a widening gap between mature organizations that use automation
and AI-enabled identity solutions to unlock measurable business value, and
the majority, who have less mature and cumbersome access processes, held
back by slow deployment, poor data integration, and limited automation.
Organizations also face growing challenges in identifying and governing the
full spectrum of identity types, from traditional human users to increasingly
complex machine identities and AI agents, which often operate with limited
visibility and fragmented ownership. This is all made more difficult by the need
to scale management of identities across multiple cloud environments.

Despite challenges faced, organizations report that identity provides the
greatest return on investment when compared to all other security domains.
Twice as many organizations ranked Identity and Access Management (IAM)
as their highest-ROI domain compared to the average (Exhibit 1). This is
because effective identity management does more than reduce risk. It drives
efficiency, accelerates transformation, and enables smarter decisions across
the enterprise.

![Exhibit 1: Investments in IAM provide the highest perceived ROI when compared to all other security domains. The chart shows IAM at 30%, followed by Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) at 22%, Data security at 13%, Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) at 12%, Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) at 10%, Network security/perimeter at 8%, and Application security at 5%.]

Over the last four years, SailPoint has surveyed IAM decision-makers across the
globe to assess their capabilities across identity security horizons and define the
future of identity. The 375 decision-makers we surveyed in June 2025 included
senior leaders in information technology, cybersecurity, and risk. More than half
work for organizations with over 10,000 employees, and the majority represent the
finance, technology, and healthcare sectors. (For details on survey demographics,
see the appendix.)

Using their responses, we grouped their organizations into five horizons based on
strategy, talent, operating model, and technology capabilities:

- At Horizon 1, the lowest maturity, organizations lack the strategy and technology
  to enable digital identities
- At Horizon 2, they have adopted some identity technology but still rely heavily on
  manual processes
- At Horizon 3, they have adopted identity capabilities at scale
- At Horizon 4, they have automated capabilities at scale and use AI to enhance
  digital identities
- At Horizon 5, the closest to the future of identity, boundaries are blurred between
  enterprise identity controls and the external identity ecosystem, and identity
  supports the business in next-gen technology innovations

The most significant shift this year has been the introduction of new capability
requirements for Horizons 4 and 5, specifically cloud infrastructure entitlement
management to secure increasingly distributed multi-cloud environments and
new capabilities to govern AI agents, reflecting the accelerating adoption of AI
within organizations.

### What we found
This year’s research highlights four critical themes from our 2025 survey of
global identity leaders. Together, they reflect where organizations stand today,
where progress is being made, and what continues to hold many teams back.

1. Organizations are falling behind as the attack landscape
   intensifies, AI agents proliferate, and the bar for mature
   identity security rises

For every three organizations that moved forward, two moved backward,
despite rising levels of identity security investment overall.

- 63 percent of organizations remain in Horizons 1 or 2, suggesting a
  significant opportunity to unlock the “full potential” of identity security.
  These programs are typically tactical, manually driven, and limited in
  their ability to support automation, AI governance, or cross-environment
  controls. However, many of these organizations are now focused on building
  foundational capabilities that will enable future scale.
- Advancement to Horizons 3 and 4+ was driven by an increased appetite to
  automate to reduce costs and new capability building. In particular, Horizon
  4 organizations this year had higher adoption across ID verification, machine
  identity management, and AI agent IAM.
- Four percent of organizations regressed in 2025. This was not due to
  declining effort, but rather a result of rising capability thresholds to meet
  Horizons 4 and 5 as the attack landscape intensifies. Organizations that
  regressed had significantly lower adoption of AI agent IAM capabilities.

2. Organizations that adopt advanced AI and identity
   data capabilities see significantly higher cost savings,
   productivity, and risk reduction

Outperforming organizations are adopting emerging AI and data capabilities
at the intersection of identity, data, and security to keep up with the evolving
attack landscape.

- Use of emerging identity data capabilities is a key enabler of downstream
  business use cases. Horizon 3+ organizations are four to eight times more
  likely to have real-time identity data synchronization, entity resolution, and
  automated lifecycle workflows compared to earlier-stage peers.
- AI is being deployed to manage identity at scale, as mature organizations
  use identity not just as a control but also as a detection mechanism.
  Adoption of AI-enabled detection capabilities, such as Identity Threat
  Detection and Response (ITDR) and privileged account monitoring, is 4 times
  as high among mature organizations than those in Horizons 1-2.
- Identity cloud data governance is maturing, although adoption of cloud
  data access controls is higher than for harder to achieve context-aware
  access models. Mature organizations are 4.5 times more likely to have cloud
  data governance capabilities such as unified policy enforcement and real-
  time data access monitoring. However, adoption of context-aware access
  capabilities such as attribute-based access control (ABAC) and ephemeral
  access models — temporary, time-bound permissions granted only when
  needed — trails behind, highlighting the opportunity to mature towards
  dynamic and just-in-time access.

3. Deployment is a critical unlock in moving across horizons,
   and many get it wrong

Despite rising levels of investment, many identity programs still struggle with
inconsistent deployment execution; however, mature organizations follow
customer success best practices to advance across horizons.

- Deployment holds some organizations back from being able to fully
  onboard emerging capabilities, but implementing horizon-specific
  best practices enables advancement. Many organizations report IAM
  deployments that ran over budget, were delayed, or did not meaningfully
  improve user experience. However, organizations employing horizon-specific
  best practices outperformed across all critical business outcomes.
- Effective management of application onboarding complexity is a universal
  customer success challenge for organizations across horizons. Application
  onboarding is especially challenging for H4+ organizations, who have
  distributed and complex environments with 3.6 times as many applications
  in their estate when compared to H1-H3 organizations. However, use of risk-
  based sequencing and reusable templates leads to better outcomes for
  organizations across horizons.
- Identity data hygiene is a critical enabler of deployment success. While 44
  percent of Horizon 4+ organizations still report gaps in identity data quality
  or normalization, organizations that prioritized and performed data cleanup
  before migration were 1.6 times more likely to be completely successful in
  their IAM tool deployment.

4. Organizations need to quantify the full value of identity to
   secure funding for advanced capabilities, including margin,
   compliance, and risk impact

Although identity enables the business through cost savings and productivity
improvements, many organizations still struggle to quantify and communicate
this impact, focusing only on compliance enablement and risk reduction.

- Only 25 percent of organizations position IAM as a strategic business
  enabler. 57 percent of organizations still describe IAM as either a
  “security control” or “compliance requirement,” limiting the role it plays in
  transformation initiatives.
- Organizations that quantify revenue and cost impact of identity
  investments are better positioned to seek increased funding. Organizations
  have traditionally quantified returns from identity security in terms of risk
  reduction and compliance enablement. However, those that quantify margin
  impact from identity security investment as well create more compelling
  business cases for increased funding.
- Integrated identity data unlocks downstream automation and new
  business use cases. When embedded into platforms like Human Resources
  (HR), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), or IT Service Management
  (ITSM), identity data powers AI assistant personalization, smarter
  provisioning, and more efficient business workflows across departments.
- Use of advanced identity security capabilities reduces risk through
  improved incident response. Identity-enabled threat detection and
  response, next-generation PAM, unified control planes, and AI agent
  governance lead to faster and more effective detection, containment, and
  remediation of incidents.

### Why it matters
Identity is now central to how organizations operate. It connects people, systems, and data while
enabling secure, automated decisions at scale, and plays a growing role in detecting and containing
threats. But while its importance is widely recognized, many organizations are not keeping pace.

Too often, identity security investments fall short of their potential. Programs sometimes stall during
deployment. IAM platforms are fragmented across teams or deprioritized entirely due to complexity,
limited expertise, or unclear ownership. As a result, impact remains siloed in IT.

However, this gap can be closed. Our research explores how organizations are making identity work in
practice — deploying solutions more effectively, building the right foundations, and turning investment
into measurable business impact.

## Chapter 1: The future of identity is tightly linked with data and security

As organizations mature across identity security horizons, the landscape they must navigate is evolving
faster than ever. In 2025, advances in AI, data management, and threat detection are reshaping identity
security. As identity shifts from a foundational control to the new frontier of security, it has emerged as
the central control point in outperforming organizations - where critical decisions are made, policies
are enforced, and security operations converge. Identity now serves as the connective tissue across
the security ecosystem, touching every domain from endpoint protection to cloud security (Exhibit 2).
This strategic positioning powers expanded governance across all human and non-human identities,
dynamic privileged access, unified and accurate visibility across environments, and automated threat
response capabilities not possible without identity telemetry. These elements are shaping the future
of integrated identity security, bringing together identity, data, and security. As integrated programs
become essential to harness identity as a dynamic method for detection and response, identity, CISO,
data, and AI organizations will have to come together to chart a singular path forward.

![Exhibit 2: As a central control point in the security tech stack, identity enables and enhances capabilities across multiple domains. The diagram shows Identity's role in Endpoint security, Network security, Cloud security, Data protection, Application security, Governance, Risk & Compliance, Threat detection/SIEM, and Third party security.]

Four trends are now shaping how identity capabilities are evolving and expanding across the security
ecosystem:

- Identity-centric governance is expanding across all identity types: Organizations are applying
  governance to a broader set of identities, including service accounts, bots, and AI agents. This
  includes discovering and cataloging machine identities, managing AI agent lifecycles, and enforcing
  time-bound access policies for ephemeral accounts.
- Privileged access is becoming dynamic and data-driven: Privileged access is no longer fixed, risking
  permanently elevated access. Access adjusts in real time based on behavioral signals, contextual
  risk, and sensitivity of the data or systems accessed. Organizations are beginning to shift the
  conversation from zero trust to continuous adaptive trust.
- Identity fabric is delivering unified control across complex environments: To reduce fragmentation,
  organizations are building identity control planes— centralized frameworks that connect identity
  data and policies across environments. The identity fabric delivers consistent policy enforcement,
  unified data models, and master identity records to enable seamless identity governance at scale.
- Identity signals are powering intelligent threat response: Identity has become a source of detection.
  Signals such as login patterns and credential misuse are being integrated into Security Incident and
  Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) platforms
  to drive threat detection, forensic investigation, and automated remediation workflows.

Together, these forces offer a blueprint for the future of identity security (Exhibit 3). By anchoring security
decisions in adaptive, data-driven controls, they enable identity to serve as both a risk mitigator
and a business enabler. As these capabilities mature, they will continue to reduce risk, accelerate
transformation, and create long-term value for the business.

While new forces are also shaping the cutting edge of identity security, capability themes referenced in
last year’s report have continued to mature. Organizations are not just sustaining momentum, they are
scaling these capability themes, applying them more broadly, and embedding them deeper into their
environments (Exhibit 3).

- Integrated identity programs have progressed from basic visibility to unified control. Organizations
  are now building identity control planes that enforce consistent policies, manage entitlements, and
  align governance across cloud, SaaS, and on-premises platforms.
- Dynamic trust models are evolving towards continuous adaptive access. Rather than point-in-time
  decisions, access levels will respond in real time to changes in user behavior, session context, and
  risk indicators.
- Federated identities are expanding into broader identity fabrics. What began as cross-platform
  Single Sign-On (SSO) is now evolving into decentralized identity control, with growing use of data-
  sharing standards and federated governance frameworks.
- Frictionless access is becoming both more seamless and more secure. Passwordless authentication
  using passkeys, biometrics, and certificates is now common, while automation is extending to
  privileged access, ephemeral credentials, and AI assistant onboarding.

![Exhibit 3: Integrated identity will power dynamic access across users, unified visibility, and automated response. The exhibit categorizes identity security trends into Nascent, Emerging, and Mainstream stages for Integrated identity security, Identity governance, Privileged access, Identity fabric, and Integrated identity telemetry.]

Leading organizations, cybersecurity standards bodies, and governments are already
embracing core elements shaping the future of identity (Exhibit 4).

## Chapter 2: Where organizations are in their journeys

### The SailPoint Horizons maturity framework
SailPoint categorizes identity security programs into five horizons based on an organization’s maturity
across four enablement areas: Strategy, technology & tools, operating model, and talent (Exhibit 5).
Since 2024, we have updated Horizons 4 and 5 with new capability thresholds, including for AI agent
lifecycle governance and cloud-native identity data protection.

![Exhibit 5: Over 4 years of annual surveys, we clustered key criteria into 5 maturity horizons guided by survey results. The exhibit describes 5 horizons: Horizon 1 (Insufficient), Horizon 2 (Foundational), Horizon 3 (Advanced), Horizon 4 (Advanced digital tools and predictive use cases), and Horizon 5 (Extended and unified identity), detailing their strategy, technology, operating model, and talent characteristics.]

Based on interviews and a new survey of 375 IAM decision makers across North America, Europe, Asia,
and Latin America, we explored where organizations stand in their identity security journeys and how
they have progressed since last year. These perspectives illustrate where organizations have excelled,
the barriers they face, and how they can move to the next maturity horizon.

### Where organizations are today
While most organizations remain early in their identity journeys, a growing number are leaning into
modernization – not just to catch up, but to build the foundations for what is next (Exhibit 6). Many
teams are investing in automation to reduce costs and improve efficiency, helping them progress out
of foundational maturity levels. At the same time, organizations are investing in AI agent governance,
machine identity management, and dynamic access controls to move to more mature horizons. These
shifts are accelerating forward momentum for some organizations, while exposing capability gaps that
are causing others to fall behind.

![Exhibit 6: Some organizations are leapfrogging across horizons while others moved backwards. The exhibit shows the distribution of organizations across 5 maturity horizons for 2023, 2024, and 2025 surveys. In 2025, 42% are in H1, 20% in H2, 27% in H3, 9% in H4, and ~1% in H5. It notes a 1% net increase from H1 & H2, and for every 3 organizations that moved forward, 2 moved backward.]

This year’s maturity shifts highlight three clear patterns. First, the move from Horizons 1 and 2 into
Horizon 3 is being driven by organizations seeking to automate manual identity tasks and reduce
operational costs. These early-stage programs are responding to resource constraints by streamlining
access workflows, especially in environments where IAM still represents a small portion of the overall
cybersecurity budget.

Second, advancement into Horizon 4 depends on building entirely new capabilities. Organizations
that progressed to these higher levels demonstrated stronger adoption of advanced identity tools,
particularly in areas such as ID verification, machine identity management, and AI agent governance.
These investments are allowing teams to move beyond manual policy enforcement toward more
adaptive and intelligent identity strategies.

Finally, organizations whose efforts remain static can move backward. Four percent of organizations
moved backward this year, unable to meet the higher capability thresholds introduced for Horizons
4 and 5. These organizations had notably lower adoption of AI agent IAM controls, signaling that, as
identity becomes more tightly linked to AI governance, gaps in capability will increasingly translate into
stalled or reversed progress.

Industry dynamics play a major role in maturity differences (Exhibit 7). Technology and banking
organizations have the greatest share in Horizon 4+, driven by higher levels of identity investment and
capability adoption.

![Exhibit 7: Tech and banking see greater share in H4 and H5 while healthcare and manufacturing lag behind average. The exhibit shows the distribution of organizations across the 5 customer identity journey horizons by industry. Technology and Banking & securities have higher percentages in Horizon 4+, while Manufacturing has the highest in Horizon 1.]

Healthcare’s rapid progress from just 6 percent in Horizon 4 in 2024 to 10 percent in 2025 is rooted
in regulatory pressure, widespread adoption of electronic health records, and urgency to automate
workflows, particularly after COVID-19. IAM investments help healthcare companies secure critical
patient data, enable clinician efficiency, and reduce compliance risk. Manufacturing, in contrast,
remains heavily clustered in Horizon 1 (61 percent), with only 4 percent in Horizon 4 and above. This lag
is tied to complex, legacy environments, lower IAM investment levels, and challenges managing diverse
identities across factory staff, contractors, and machines.

![Exhibit 8: North American and APAC see greater share in H4+ while Europe and LATAM lag behind average. The exhibit shows the distribution of organizations across the 5 customer identity journey horizons by geography. APAC and North America have higher percentages in Horizon 4+, while Europe and LATAM have higher percentages in Horizon 1 and 2.]

Identity security maturity also varies greatly across regions, with APAC and North America having the
greatest share of organizations in Horizon 4+ (Exhibit 8). Identity security maturity of North American
organizations is driven by regulatory pressures, greater levels of security funding, and greater cloud
adoption. APAC maturity distribution features organizations at both ends of the spectrum—the highest
representation of Horizon 1 (56%) organizations alongside the highest representation of Horizon 4+
(15%)—reflecting the region’s diverse markets and varying level of readiness for digital transformation.
European organizations, despite strong data protection frameworks, show 50% still in Horizon 1,
suggesting opportunity to invest in capabilities that establish compliance and grow maturity. The
majority of Latin American organizations remain in Horizons 1 and 2, indicating lower levels of maturity
and adoption challenges.

Amid these geographic and sector-specific shifts,
