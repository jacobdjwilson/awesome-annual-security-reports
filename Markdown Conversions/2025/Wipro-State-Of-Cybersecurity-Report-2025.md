AI is driving continual innovation and
disruption — acting as both friend and foe
at a time when CISOs are under
financial pressure to do more with less.

Digital infrastructure transformation remains a top
priority for today’s business leaders. Increased
technological complexity, constantly evolving regulations
and a rise in sophisticated cyber threats across
multi-hybrid cloud environments create daunting
challenges for security teams. CISOs need to adopt a
risk-adjusted, outcome-oriented mindset and
transition from technologists who merely prevent and
react to breaches to risk strategists focused on
optimizing enterprise cyber resilience.

This report answers three key questions:
1. What is the current state of cyberattacks and breaches?

2. What is the state of enterprise capabilities for

addressing evolving threats?

3. Which technologies are poised to impact enterprise

cybersecurity in the near future?

The extensive data in this report reveal how global
organizations are navigating today’s cybersecurity
environment.

Two big themes are at the forefront of these efforts:
AI and automation — AI is driving exponential productivity
gains, enhancing threat detection, automating repetitive
tasks, and remediating security vulnerabilities. By
providing deeper insights than human analysis alone, AI
empowers teams to focus on strategic initiatives,
transforming cybersecurity programs by strengthening
defenses, optimizing costs, and enabling faster, more agile
threat responses.

Cost optimization — CISOs face growing pressure to
maximize security investments with limited financial
resources. Cyber strategies are shifting from simple

budget increases to a more outcome-driven ap-
proach, prioritizing the use of people, processes,
and technology to deliver greater cybersecurity and
risk-adjusted returns on investments.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 5

# The Big Picture

The interplay between AI and cybersecurity will
have far reaching consequences as organizations
continue their digital transformation journey. AI will
make cybersecurity capabilities more efficient and
impactful across functions like risk assessments,
compliance reporting, data protection, cyber
defense, incident response, and other critical
domains. But this is the proverbial double-edged
sword. AI models and systems will be severely
tested by targeted cyberattacks.

This year’s State of Cybersecurity Report highlights
macro perspectives on global nation-state
cyberattacks, provides micro views of how
organizations are mobilizing their cyber defenses and
looks at what the future holds for cyber by examining
patent filings and cyber venture investment trends.

Nation-state attacks
and trade wars ramp up
The world is waking up to the reality of a heightened
trade war and growing protectionism. Even before
the trade wars kicked off, the focus of 86% of global
nation-state attacks has been on intellectual
property theft, and we expect this to further escalate
in the current environment. The private sector has
experienced 32% of all public nation-state attacks
while 42% of attacks targeted government entities.

AI Enabled Attacks
Email phishing continues to be the dominant vector
threat actors are using to breach security defenses.
We expect phishing campaigns to get increasingly
more sophisticated with the use of AI-enabled attacks.
Among organizations that have experienced a breach,
31% have fallen victim to repeat breaches within a
three-year window. This highlights the cascading and
long-term effects breaches can have on brand
reputation and stakeholder trust.

Risk reporting to the board
is becoming more frequent
The good news is organizations are getting better at
dealing with cybersecurity risks. The percentage of
organizations with proactive cyber governance from
the board increased over enterprises relying on
reactive governance. Cyber risk reporting to the board
is happening more frequently and the reliability and
quality of these risk reports are improving thanks to
the use of strategic technology.

AI strengthens and disrupts
CISOs are evolving their security operations centers
based on practical wins where GenAI can be
realistically leveraged for speed and efficiency. When
it comes to managing the safety and security risks of
AI, organizations continue to struggle with fractured
ownership, lack of AI expertise and an uncertain AI
regulatory environment.

Agentic AI & PQC pave the way to the future
We examined future trends by reviewing global cyber
patent filings and their geopolitical implications. While
China has been leading the race in AI-related patent
filings quantitatively, the bulk of their filings remain
unprotected in patent realms outside of China. With
the slew of competing GenAI models being released,
the global AI arms race is heating up with the US
continuing to be the driving force. Beyond AI patents,
filings related to quantum computing and
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) are on the rise,
indicating that we are closer to a seismic change
in IT than what was previously thought. Venture
investments in cybersecurity startups are also a
great leading indicator for security teams to track.
VC focus on Agentic AI and AI Guardrails standout.
The US, Israel and Europe continue to dominate the
security startup space based on the number of deals
closed. The report highlights top research and
investment trends in the future section.

# STATE OF ATTACKS,

# AND BREACHES

# Nation-State Cyber Warfare

Nation-state cyberattacks are a major aspect of
modern geopolitical conflicts. Nation-state actors are
improving their cyber operations skills, creating
sophisticated malware, taking advantage of weaknesses,
and employing ever-more-advanced tactics to accomplish
their goals. Primarily, these attacks aim to disable
critical infrastructure, acquire or eliminate sensitive
information, damage national security, and disrupt
defense establishments.

To provide a macro view of the situation, we conducted a
secondary data analysis tracked by the Council on Foreign
Relations and the Center for Strategic and International
Studies from 2022 to 2025. We analyzed the source
countries and targeted countries along with the intents
and types of attacks.

Data point summary

- 86% of all attacks are espionage related

- 42% of all targets are government entities

- The main aggressor countries are China,
Russia, Iran and North Korea

- The most targeted country is the US,
representing 12% of all attacks, followed
by Ukraine at 11%

![Nation State Attack Analysis]

Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 19

Top 5 trends:

1. Increased sophistication and persistence
Advanced persistent threats (APTs):
Highly skilled and well-funded hacker groups

backed by nation states can maintain long-term
access to target networks. They often go
undetected for an extended period while they
siphon data, erase data, or conduct espionage
activities.

Custom-built malware: Nation states are

investing in sophisticated malware like zero-day
exploits that are highly customized for specific
targets, making them difficult to identify and
defend against.

2. Targeting critical infrastructure
Disruption of essential services: Another

common cyber warfare trend is the targeting of
critical infrastructure like power transmission,
goods transportation, healthcare, or payment
infrastructure. These attacks aim to ensure
services are either fully or partially disrupted.

Industrial control system (ICS) attacks:
These attacks are focused on compromising the
industrial control systems that operate critical
infrastructures to inflict serious economic
dam age, social crisis, or security concerns.

3. Cyber espionage and data theft

Intellectual property theft: Governments are
waging cyber warfare against the private and
public sectors to steal intellectual property,
sensitive trade secrets, classified information,
and military data. This poses significant risk to
economic stability and national security.

Supply chain attacks: Governments are targeting
critical supply chains to compromise sensitive
information as well as cripple operations.

4. Weaponization of social media

Influence operations: Social media platforms
are being used by adversary countries to spread
disinformation, manipulate public opinion and
influence election results. This can undermine
trust in democratic processes and institutions
and destabilize societies by furthering cultural
and political divisiveness.

Harassment and intimidation: Social media is
being used to harass and intimidate individuals
or groups, with the intent of silencing dissent and
suppressing free speech.

5. Offensive and defensive cyber
capabilities:

Cyber arms race: Nation-states are developing
offensive and defensive cyber capabilities.
This is creating a cyber arms race with countries
competing to develop the most advanced
cyberattack tactics and malware, along with
increasingly sophisticated threat detection

methods.

As the threat of nation-state cyber warfare
continues to evolve, governments and
organizations around the world must invest in
robust cyber defenses and develop effective
strategies to protect against these adversaries.
There is a growing need for international
cooperation to develop common standards, share
information and coordinate responses to
cyberattacks.

Types of targeted data
An analysis of 84 major data breaches between
July 2022 and June 2024 showed that different
types of PII — personally identifiable information
information — had distinct levels of economic value.

We identified seven types of PII targeted by

cyber attackers:

- Basic PII (name, contact number, email
address, physical address)
- Basic PII + financials (tax information,
payment card information, bank account
statements)
- Basic PII + IP address
- Basic PII + user credentials

(encrypted/unencrypted credentials)

- Advanced PII (Basic PII, gender, date of birth,

identification numbers, driver’s license

numbers)
- Advanced PII + financials
- Advanced PII + user credentials + IP address

The motivations behind cyberattacks are diverse.

The trends observed from 2022 to 2025 suggest a

shifting threat landscape where attackers are

targeting advanced PII for more long-term

exploitation and focusing on sectors handling

sensitive data, such as technology, BFSI, and

healthcare. The growing complexity of attacks

demands a stronger, more agile response from

organizations, including robust security measures

and continuous threat assessment to mitigate

risks. The future of cybersecurity will depend on

proactive measures, cross-industry collaboration,

and technological advancements to keep pace

with evolving threats.

Has your organization identified a data breach in the recent past?

![Data Breaches Identified in Recent Past Across Organizations]

Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 26
Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 26

Among surveyed organizations,
56% identified one or more data
breaches in the recent past.
31% of these organizations
experienced a repeat breach within
three years of the first breach.

Among surveyed organizations, 56% identified one

or more data breaches in the recent past.

Around one third (31%) of these organizations

experienced a repeat breach within three years of

the first breach. Another concerning trend is that

13% of surveyed organizations experienced more

than one breach in a span of just one year, up from

just 8% revealed in the 2023 data.

Among organizations that experienced repeat

incursions, often the subsequent breaches were

not linked to the initial attack. After learning of a

breach, new threat actors are motivated to attack,

illustrating the ongoing harm that breach

publicity can inflict on enterprises.

The flip side is that many breaches remain

undetected for extended periods. This lack of
visibility means that organizations may be

unaware of repeat breaches, compromising their

efforts to effectively secure their systems.

The data underscore the importance of robust

cybersecurity measures and continuous

monitoring to promptly detect and mitigate

breaches.

# Top Cyber Risks

While the emergence of AI has reshaped the

dynamic cyber threat landscape, the top risk in

2025—email phishing—remained the same as reported

in 2023. Third-party risk emerged as the second

significant risk, replacing ransomware attacks.

![Top Cyber Risks]

Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 29

Email phishing (65%): Cybercriminals are
increasingly using AI to automate attacks, develop

sophisticated malware, and create highly

convincing phishing schemes.

Third-party risks (49%): Interconnected
ecosystems amplify third-party vulnerabilities,

necessitating stringent risk management and

continuous monitoring.

Security awareness / negligence (44%):
As attackers adopt more advanced AI technologies,

it is important to develop and practice a strong

security awareness program so employees can

identify and avoid potential security threats.

Ransomware attacks (40%): As targeted extortion
tactics replace more widespread attacks,

companies must implement robust backup,

protection and incident response strategies.

To stay ahead of these threats, organizations must

invest in advanced AI-driven security solutions,

continuously monitor AI developments, and foster

a culture of innovation and adaptation within their

cybersecurity teams. This requires a proactive

approach to cybersecurity, leveraging advanced

technologies and fostering a culture of security

awareness to safeguard digital assets.

# Board Alignment for
# Cybersecurity

As regulatory pressures mount, it
is anticipated that more boards will
integrate dedicated cybersecurity
experts and form specialized
subcommittees.

As cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and

frequency, the role of corporate boards in overseeing

and guiding cybersecurity strategies is also growing.

Effective cyber governance is about ensuring the

resilience and trustworthiness of the entire digital
enterprise. This necessitates a strategic alignment

between the board and cybersecurity functions that

promotes proactive risk management and informed

decision-making.

Boards must move beyond traditional oversight roles

and become actively engaged in cybersecurity

governance. This shift is driven by the need to address

regulatory requirements, stakeholder expectations,

and the increasing financial and reputational risks

associated with cyber incidents. By integrating

cybersecurity expertise at the board level and

establishing dedicated subcommittees, organizations

can better navigate the complexities of cyber risk and

enhance the organization’s overall security posture.

The following analysis delves into the current state of

board involvement in cybersecurity, highlighting key

trends and the growing emphasis on proactive

governance.

Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 31
Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 31

According to our latest research, board involvement

As regulatory pressures mount, it is anticipated

in cybersecurity is evolving in a positive direction. The

that more boards will integrate dedicated

survey responses can be grouped into two categories:

cybersecurity experts and form specialized

subcommittees. This trend is expected to enhance

business alignment, budgeting, and communication

both within the enterprise and with external

regulators. The presence of well-coordinated board

expertise will be crucial in navigating the complex

landscape of cybersecurity governance in the

coming years.

1. Limited Cyber Oversight:

This group reflects a more hands-off approach

to cybersecurity governance and includes

organizations with an independent cyber

advisor appointed by the board (5%) and those

with no specific owner for cyber within the

board structure (31%). In 2023, approximately

51% of organizations fell into the limited cyber

oversight group. In 2025, that number fell to

36%, indicating a general improvement in

board involvement.

2. Proactive Cyber Governance:

This group reflects a higher level of
dedicated cybersecurity oversight and
governance within the board due to the
inclusion of designated board members
with cyber risk experience (23%) and/or a
separate cyber risk committee to oversee
cybersecurity preparedness (41%). Proactive
cyber governance organizations increased
from 49% in 2023 to approximately 64% in

2025.

![Board Alignment to Oversee Cyber Risks]

Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 32

# CISO Reporting

As enterprises advance in their digital

transformation journeys, cyber risk management

and reporting strategies are evolving. We’ve shown

that incorporating cyber expertise at the board

level is critical. Given the pressures on IT departments
to deliver innovative technology and keep pace with

market demands, it is equally important to position

risk management and reporting responsibilities in the

most effective manner below the board.

For well over a decade, it’s been most common for

CISOs to report to CIOs. This has been reasonably

effective for IT risk management.

Our survey data reveals that 53% of organizations still

have their CISOs reporting to the CIO. 22% of

organizations now have their CISOs report directly to

the CEO or have regular CEO reviews, and 8% report

to the CFO. Additionally, 17% of CISOs report to other

C-level executives such as the COO, CRO or the general

counsel.

Some organizations are transitioning cybersecurity

into a business-risk-aligned management structure

to enhance accountability at the board level, promote

risk-aware behavior throughout the organization, and

strengthen the case for necessary cybersecurity

investments. This realignment ensures that

cybersecurity is recognized not merely as an IT

concern but as a vital element of the overall business

strategy.

![CISO Direct Reporting]

Wipro State of Cybersecurity Report 2025 | 33

# Cyber Risk Reporting

50% of organizations now report
cyber risks to their boards on a
quarterly basis, a significant
increase from previous years.

Due to evolving regulations on cyber disclosures,

board visibility on cyber risk reports is a critical

factor in maintaining robust cybersecurity governance.

According to the latest survey, 50% of organizations
now report cyber risks to their boards on a quarterly

basis, a significant increase from 2023 (41%). 25% of

organizations provide monthly cyber risk reports, while

11% report semi-annually. This upward trend shows

growing emphasis on regular cybersecurity reporting

to higher management. At the other end of the scale,

8% of organizations report on an annual basis, and 3%

do so on an ad hoc basis.

Notably, 3% of organizations do not have a formal

reporting mechanism in place. These findings highlight

the diverse approaches organizations are taking to

keep their boards informed about cybersecurity risks.

# Security Budget and
# Investment Priorities

In this latest survey, only 10% of organizations

reported allocating more than 12% of their annual IT

budget to cybersecurity, compared to 21% in2023.

Looking at this another way, only 20% of

organizations are allocating more than 10% of their
annual IT budget for security compared to 32% in 2023.

This indicates that cybersecurity budgets may not be

keeping pace with the growing sophistication of cyber

threats.

The cybersecurity budget is a critical component if an

organization expects to improve its risk management

strategy. But it’s clear that security budgets are

experiencing a downturn due to general economic

concerns and heightened scrutiny of corporate

budgets across the enterprise. Organizations are

gradually shifting priorities towards spending better

rather than spending more. In this environment,

cybersecurity spend needs to be well thought out,

optimized and prioritized toward the most critical
assets and vulnerabilities. Security leaders are under

increasing pressure to follow a strategy that is both

cost effective and aligned with the organization’s

strategic priorities.

![Percentage Range of Annual IT Budget Allocated for Security]
