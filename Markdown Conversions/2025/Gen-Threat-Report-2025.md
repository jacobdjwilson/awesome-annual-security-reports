This quarter, Gen Threat Labs shines a light on PharmaFraud - a network of fake online pharmacies stealing people’s data and money. Avast released free decryptor to combat the first AI-built ransomware while we saw tech support scams spreading on Facebook.

## PharmaFraud: Fake pharmacies, real danger

![Image: Infographic showing 1M fake pharmacy attacks blocked and 5,000+ fake sites linked to cyber gang MediPhantom.]

**1M** fake pharmacy attacks blocked

**5,000+** fake sites linked to cyber gang MediPhantom

Thousands of slick-looking online pharmacies are actually run by one giant cybercrime network: MediPhantom. These sites prey on people looking for medications quickly, discreetly or at a lower cost. But, unfortunately, they are putting themselves, their identities and their bank accounts at serious risk.

Most targeted drugs:
- Erectile dysfunction pills
- Weight-loss meds
- Antibiotics

Tactics used:
- Malicious code in real medical sites
- AI-generated fake health blogs and reviews
- Search engine manipulation

Red flags:
- Crypto-only payments and unsecured checkouts
- Prescription drugs without proof of prescription
- Too-good-to-be-true prices

## FunkSec: AI meets ransomware

### The big picture:
- First known ransomware crew to openly use generative AI
- Asked for just 0.1 Bitcoin, but attacked schools, child protection orgs, retailers and more
- Gen built a free decryptor (distributed through Avast) to help victims recover without paying

### Why it matters:
Cybercriminals are moving faster with AI. But good tech and global teamwork can still outsmart them.

## The perfect crime? Why Facebook is a top weapon for cybercriminals

Facebook continues to be a hotbed for cyber scams, supporting massive spikes in both financial fraud (**+340%**) and tech support scams (**14%** of all Facebook threats) in the last quarter.

### Why it matters:
Facebook is where your mom, your neighbor and your local teacher hang out online. When scams flood platforms like Facebook, they’re not targeting corporations, they’re targeting ordinary people. Everyday users are being tricked by deepfake videos, fake legal help pages and fraudulent investment opportunities, all looking deceptively real. The impact is personal: lost savings, stolen identities and a growing sense that it’s getting harder to tell what’s real online.

### Facebook tech support scams:
- 14% of Facebook threats
- Fake messenger-style pop-ups asking people to fix their machines
- Locked browsers and fake call support prompts

## Fast facts.

### What to watch.

### 3 must-know stats
- 16 billion leaked credentials are still circulating
- 317% rise in malicious push notifications
- 100+ ransomware victims hit by AI-assisted malware in just 3 months

### Trends to watch
1. Cybercrime is scaling like a business: Global teams. Big data. Branding. Even live-chat support.
2. AI is now a criminal co-pilot: Phishing templates, malware builds, social engineering, it’s speeding everything up.
3. Disruption ≠ Deletion: Takedowns help, but criminals adapt fast. Malware like Lumma keeps coming.
