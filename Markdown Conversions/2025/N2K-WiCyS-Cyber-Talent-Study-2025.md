## Executive Summary

### 2025 WiCyS Talent Study Update

As a Strategic and Research Partner of Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS), skillrex led the analysis and development of this updated Cyber Talent Study, building on findings from the original 2024 report. This refreshed analysis incorporates data from additional WiCyS members who completed a cybersecurity skills diagnostic provided by N2K Networks. Using its workforce intelligence methodology, skillrex assessed member capabilities against the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework and its own Functional Group taxonomy—delivering new insights into strengths, areas for growth, and overall workforce readiness across the WiCyS community.

This report provides a data-driven look at the cybersecurity capabilities of WiCyS members, revealing their strong performance across every NICE Category and 16 out of 20 NICE Specialty Areas assessed. Through skillrex’s analytic approach, the study uncovers areas where WiCyS members outperform industry norms and where there is potential for continued development.

The findings highlight not only the depth of technical and strategic skills across the WiCyS community but also their readiness to lead in a dynamic cybersecurity landscape. These insights help inform the design of future programs, training investments, and partnership opportunities—reinforcing WiCyS’s mission to recruit, retain and advance women in cybersecurity.

## Executive Summary

This Cyber Talent Study began as a joint effort between Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS) and N2K Networks in 2023, with an initial cohort of 399 participants completing a cybersecurity skills diagnostic designed to assess knowledge and proficiency across the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. In 2025, the study was expanded to include additional WiCyS members, significantly enhancing the depth and breadth of the dataset.

Building on this foundation, WiCyS formalized a research partnership with skillrex in 2025. As both a Research and Strategic Partner of WiCyS, skillrex led the updated analysis and development of this report. Leveraging its workforce intelligence methodology and proprietary Functional Group taxonomy, skillrex evaluated participant performance across key cybersecurity domains to uncover patterns of excellence and areas for targeted growth.

The skills diagnostic used in this study was provided by N2K Networks and mapped to both the NICE Framework and skillrex’s Functional Groups. The resulting analysis highlights high performance across technical and leadership domains and provides actionable insights to guide WiCyS’s future programming, training strategies, and member development initiatives.

### Total Participants: 604

### Experience Levels:

*   Junior: 161
*   Mid: 94
*   Senior: 61
*   Manager: 44
*   Not Indicated: 244

## The Participants

WiCyS members participating in the study represented a broad spectrum of cybersecurity roles and experience levels. A total of 604 members completed the diagnostic. Because some survey fields were optional, 40.4% of participants did not indicate their experience level, and 31.1% did not specify the cybersecurity functional area they represented.

![Pie chart showing the distribution of participant experience levels, with 'Not Indicated' being the largest segment.](Image description)

*   Not Indicated: 40.4%
*   Manager: 7.3%
*   Senior: 10%
*   Junior: 26.6%
*   Mid: 15.6%

## Analyzing & Interpreting results

Skillrex’s analysis revealed significant strengths among WiCyS members, who consistently demonstrated exceptional proficiency across the NICE Framework. Notably high performance was observed in the Specialty Areas of Executive Cyber Leadership, Cyber Operational Planning, Legal Advice & Advocacy, Cybersecurity Management, and Targets. These findings not only showcase the depth of technical expertise and leadership readiness within the WiCyS community, but also identify targeted opportunities to further enhance workforce impact through continued development.

Skillrex analyzed the results of the diagnostic, using Experience Levels and skillrex’s Functional Groupings as key components to interpret results. Because N2K’s NICE Workforce Diagnostic tests participants’ knowledge and skills across the broad spectrum of the NICE Framework, it’s important to analyze the results through the lens of the functions of their work roles and experience. As a result, skillrex can interpret results by Experience Levels, skillrex’s Functional Grouping, and NICE Specialty Areas (and combinations thereof).

## About the NIST-NICE Cyber Workforce Framework:

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cyber Workforce Framework, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), plays a crucial role in addressing cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development needs. By providing a standardized taxonomy and common lexicon, the NIST-NICE Cyber Workforce Framework enables organizations to define and understand the essential tasks, knowledge, and skill (TKS) statements required for cybersecurity roles. This framework not only aids in the development and training of cybersecurity professionals but also helps in workforce planning and management. Additionally, the NICE Framework establishes a taxonomy and common lexicon that describes cybersecurity work and workers irrespective of where or for whom the work is performed. Since the launch of this study, the NICE Framework has had several updates.

## Summary of Participant Relative Performance Score by skillrex Functional Group:

![Bar chart showing Relative Performance Scores (RPS) for WiCyS members across various skillrex Functional Groups.](Image description)

*Relative Performance Score (RPS): a skillrex scoring metric that excludes questions that are not relevant to Work Roles or Specialty Areas that align to each skillrex Functional Group, and instead only measures performance on questions that are most-relative to the typical knowledge and competency expectations for each Functional Group or Work Role.

In addition to the NICE Framework Specialty Areas, skillrex has classified the NICE Specialty Areas into broader Functional Groups as part of the methodology for this report. WiCyS members have demonstrated superior performance across three major functional groups:

*   **Cybersecurity Workforce & Awareness, 63.3%**: The performance WiCyS members have a strong foundation in training and mentorship, which is critical for the ongoing development of the cybersecurity workforce.
*   **Cybersecurity/IT Leadership & MGMT, 64.8%**: WiCyS members demonstrate strong leadership capabilities essential for advancing within the cybersecurity industry.
*   **Cybersecurity/IT Policy & GRC, 67.8%**: Members demonstrate a sophisticated grasp of governance, risk, and compliance issues critical to organizational cybersecurity strategies.

## WiCyS strategic initiatives
