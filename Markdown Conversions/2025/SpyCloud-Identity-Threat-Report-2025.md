WE’VE ALL FELT THE PERIMETER SHIFT...

Today, identity is the gravitational center of modern cybercrime – and the critical point
around which the majority of attacks now orbit.

Teams are aware that identity attacks have broadened the boundaries of traditional
perimeter defense. But there’s a growing gap between perceived control and
actual preparedness.

This year’s SpyCloud Identity Threat Report, which surveyed more than 500 cybersecurity
professionals, uncovers a troubling pattern: 86% of security leaders express confidence in
their ability to prevent major identity-based attacks. Yet 85% of organizations were affected
by a ransomware incident at least once in the past year, and over one-third affected
between six and ten times.

This confidence gap extends beyond ransomware, to incidents rooted in infostealer
malware infections, phishing attacks, supply chain exposures, and more – reflecting a
broader disconnect between how secure organizations feel and how vulnerable they truly
are to identity-based threats like account takeover, session hijacking, insider threats, and
fraud. Security teams’ confidence, it turns out, may be grounded more in perception than in
operational readiness.

HOUSTON, WE HAVE AN IDENTITY THREAT PROBLEM.

A quick note: The 2025 Identity Threat Report is the evolution of our previous annual Malware and Ransomware Defense Report. As threat actors have expanded TTPs, so too has our purview expanded here at SpyCloud, and as such, the scope of this report. We’re now calling this the Identity Threat Report to better capture the identity-based nature of the most pervasive threats challenging security teams today.

<a name="key-takeaways-from-this-years-report"></a>
## KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS YEAR’S REPORT

We asked security teams to share their perceptions and preparedness as threat actors take advantage
of a perfect storm of opportunities: the ever-present occurrence of human error, combined with vast
digital identity sprawl, the rapid industrialization of cybercrime, and AI-driven tactics.

WE FOUND THAT:

over
**two-thirds**
of organizations are
significantly or extremely

identity-based
cyberattacks

**85%**

When it comes to initial access

AND YET THE CURRENT DEFENSE
GAPS PROVE WORRISOME:

**less than 20%**
are able to automate and optimize
identity exposure remediation
across systems

A mere **38%**
can detect historical identity
exposures that create risk due
to poor cyber hygiene like
credential reuse

**ONLY 41%**

credentials after a phishing attack

and only **54%**

**less than HALF**

integrated AI into their
own defenses

**only 50%**
of organizations have visibility
into infostealer malware
infections on managed devices

and even fewer **(48%)**
can detect them across both
managed and unmanaged
endpoints

While organizations generally rate their defense capabilities high, the numbers in
this year’s report tell a different story – the majority of defenses largely point to
overblown confidence and reactive mitigation strategies.

BUT COURSE CORRECTIONS CAN BE MADE.

The data also shows that organizations that invest in identity-centric strategies, focus on security fundamentals like credential resets
and session invalidation, and build automated, cross-team workflows are not only detecting threats earlier, they’re more likely to recover
data after ransomware incidents, reduce attacker dwell time, and avoid financial fallout like ransom payments or customer churn.

In this report, we chart the coordinates for operational maturity. Not just a defense against today’s threats, but a proactive course
correction toward long-term security sustainability.

## THE THREAT RESURGENCE: MODERN ATACK REALITIES

IDENTITY SPRAWL AND THE EXPANDING ATTACK SURFACE –––

An individual’s digital identity now spans hundreds of touchpoints: personal and corporate credentials, session
tokens, financial data, and personally identifiable information (PII) sprawling across SaaS tools, corporate and
unmanaged devices, and more. These elements – when exposed on the darknet – form a vast, connected, and
increasingly vulnerable attack surface.

This fragmentation is exactly why identity has become the gravitational center of cybercrime. Rather than
battering down fortified perimeters, attackers exploit the exposed threads of identity, slipping through overlooked
gaps and escalating access from within.

THE GRAVITY OF MODERN CYBER THREATS –––

Today’s adversaries are orchestrating hybrid attacks that blend technical exploits with human deception. Rather
than relying solely on software vulnerabilities, which have long been standard fare, attackers now increasingly
weaponize identity sprawl – and organizations are taking notice.

According to our findings, over three-quarters of organizations report significant or extreme concern across these
threat categories:

THREAT LANDSCAPE

If teams fail to seal the gaps, attackers will seize the path of least resistance and exploit it repeatedly.

SpyCloud has recaptured more than 850 billion exposed identity assets, demonstrating the vast scale of exposed
data in circulation on the dark web. With so many stolen identity fragments available, bad actors have plenty of
access opportunities at their disposal.

Recent industry research confirms the breadth and urgency of this threat:

**91% OF ORGANIZATIONS EXPERIENCED AN IDENTITY-RELATED INCIDENT IN THE PAST YEAR – NEARLY DOUBLE THE PREVIOUS YEAR’S TOTAL**

SPYCLOUD HAS RECAPTURED **63.8 BILLION** DISTINCT IDENTITY RECORDS FROM THE DARK WEB, A 24% INCREASE YEAR-OVER-YEAR

To stop this cycle, defenders need more than visibility. They need the ability to close the door and change the
locks – fast. That means remediating compromised identities, invalidating stolen sessions, and making sure
what bad actors have can’t be used against them in a follow-on attack.

![Image of a bar graph showing concern levels for different threat landscapes]

**PHISHING**
40% EXTREMELY CONCERNED

**RANSOMWARE**
37% EXTREMELY CONCERNED

**NATION-STATE ADVERSARIES**
36% EXTREMELY CONCERNED

**UNMANAGED OR UNAUTHORIZED DEVICES**
36% EXTREMELY CONCERNED

And as shown to the right, nearly 40% of survey respondents flagged four or more of these threats
as “extreme,” underscoring the pressure security teams face to prioritize an ever-expanding attack
surface.

Certain groups show even greater concern. Security leaders in the healthcare (52%) and IT (47%)
industries are more likely to be extremely concerned about phishing. Energy and utility sectors
express elevated worry around malware (48%).

Lived experience also appears to drive heightened vigilance. Organizations that were affected
by ransomware six or more times in the past year are significantly more likely to be extremely
concerned about insider risk (43%) and phishing (48%). And those who haven’t been attacked?
They’re markedly less concerned about these issues, highlighting just how much direct exposure
shapes cybersecurity priorities.

A DANGEROUS COMBINATION:
NATION-STATE ADVERSARIES AND INSIDER THREATS

Security teams at Fortune 500 and other US companies are showing increasing
awareness of threats from Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) nationals
infiltrating their workplaces. Fraudulent IT workers are impersonating contractors and job
candidates, obtaining remote work positions in software engineering and IT under synthetic or stolen
identities. Their paychecks then presumably go towards funding the North Korean regime. The FBI
has also warned that these individuals are increasingly engaging in data theft and extortion against
the companies that have inadvertently hired them.

A recent SpyCloud study shows that over a third of security professionals are extremely concerned
about insider threats, and more than half of enterprises report experiencing an insider threat incident
within this last year. Investigative tooling and mitigation strategies should be top priorities for
enterprises in the year ahead.

STOLEN IDENTITY DATA AND DANGEROUS FOLLOW-ON ATTACKS –––

When it comes to threats survey respondents are most worried about leading to follow-on
attacks, phishing again tops the list, followed by supply chain exposures, malware infections, and
insider threats.

MONITORING THE IDENTITY SOLAR SYSTEM:
SUPPLY CHAIN IDENTITY THREAT INDEX* BY INDUSTRY

Vendors and supply chain partners with privileged access are prime targets to
become entry points for attackers. SpyCloud’s Identity Threat Index can be applied
across industries to reveal which segments face a higher frequency of identity threats based on the
severity of darknet exposures and domain targeting. Threats stemming from malware, phishing
attacks, third-party breaches, and circulated combolists were considered and included in this analysis.

Based upon active threats seen through recent darknet exposures, SpyCloud analysis indicates
the IT, telecom, and software industries are experiencing the highest levels of threats facing their
organizations in 2025. We recommend enterprises confirm they are prepared to respond to active
supply chain threats by prioritizing the following steps:

- Continuous monitoring of active identity threats facing your vendors
- Open and transparent lines of communication about active threats
- Implementation of controls to limit the access and impact of vendor security issues
- Incident response (IR) planning that includes security issues of key vendors

*SpyCloud calculates its Supply Chain Identity Threat Index using darknet exposure data. Data analyzed is
from the first six months of 2025.

ENTRY INTO A PERPETUAL ATTACK ORBIT –––

The defense mission has changed. We know that attackers can piece together identity data from
multiple sources, leveraging phished cookies, malware-exfiltrated API keys, and recycled user
credentials to find various entry points. Their approach is opportunistic, aimed at creating maximum
disruption through whatever access they can find. Organizations are rightfully concerned about
related risks:

1 | PHISHING / SOCIAL ENGINEERING (39%)
2 | AI-GENERATED THREATS (35%)
3 | EXPOSED OR WEAK CREDENTIALS (35%)
4 | THIRD-PARTY OR SUPPLY CHAIN COMPROMISE (33%)

BY SURVEY RESPONDENTS

Phishing blazes the ransomware trail – and evolves

Phishing remains one of the most pervasive cyber threats to businesses because the data collected
in a successful phish is so useful for the more malicious follow-on attack. Case in point: Phishing
was cited by 35% of respondents as the leading entry point by organizations that experienced
at least one ransomware attack in 2025, up from 25% last year, a significant 10-point increase
that underscores both its growth in popularity and its evolution.

This rise may also reflect the increased sophistication of phishing campaigns, many of which
now leverage capabilities like 2FA theft or AI functionality to create hyper-targeted lures tuned to
individual employees or business units.

## TOP PHISHING THREATS OF 2025 –––

SpyCloud recaptures data from phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms and kits,
including both phishing targeting lists and successfully phished user data. Analyzing
these tools and their capabilities is helpful for understanding how bad actors are
quickly evolving their phishing tactics to extract valuable user information.

PHISHING

![Image of a list of top phishing threats]

**FLOWERSTORMPHAAS**
FlowerStorm is a PhaaS platform that emerged in mid-2024, rapidly gaining prominence following the November 2024 disruption of Rockstar 2FA. Both platforms share striking similarities in their design and operation, suggesting a possible shared origin or operational overlap. FlowerStorm is also known as Storm-1167, or ODx, and is designed to steal Microsoft 365 credentials and MFA tokens, using AitM attacks to bypass authentication.

**EVILGINXFRAMEWORK**
Evilginx is a sophisticated AitM phishing framework designed to intercept login credentials and session cookies, effectively bypassing MFA protections. Initially developed as an open-source tool for penetration testing, it has evolved into a modular platform capable of targeting various services, including Microsoft 365, Google, and LinkedIn.

**TYCOON2FA PHaaS**
Tycoon 2FA is a sophisticated PhaaS platform that has been active since August 2023. It specializes in bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections, particularly targeting Microsoft 365 and Gmail accounts. The platform employs an Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) technique, capturing session cookies during the authentication process to grant unauthorized access to user accounts.

THE REVOLVING STEALTH THREAT: INFOSTEALER MALWARE –––

STEALERS ON THE RADAR –––

We can’t talk about the most pressing threats today without talking about infostealer malware. Security professionals –
including our researchers here at SpyCloud – have been raising concerns about infostealers for years, but only recently
has the broader security community recognized the scale of damage they are capable of causing. Stealers are finally
getting the attention they unfortunately deserve.

Based on our collection of recaptured infostealer malware data from more than 80 different malware
families, LummaC2 – which targets Windows devices and can exfiltrate PII, financial information, crypto
wallets, password vaults, 2FA secrets, and more – has consistently been the top infostealer malware in
terms of daily numbers of infections since the fall of 2024.

INFOSTEALER MALWARE

SPYCLOUD INSIGHT

An analysis of SpyCloud data shows that about 1 in 2 corporate users* have
been the victim of an infostealer infection in their digital history, whether that be
on a managed or unmanaged device. Additionally, and worthy to note, our data
shows that 66% of malware infections occur on devices with endpoint security or antivirus
solutions installed.

*Calculated using a sample of all-time recaptured corporate identity data using SpyCloud’s holistic identity
matching analytics.

Infostealer malware operates quietly in the background, collecting swaths of identity information like credentials,
financial information, session tokens, and much more – without setting off antivirus or EDR alarms. Once attackers
exfiltrate data, they can use it in a myriad of illicit tactics to take over accounts with stolen credentials or hijack active
sessions and bypass MFA controls in the case of stolen session cookies, which can allow ongoing access until the
session expires or is invalidated.

**ONLY 54% OF ORGANIZATIONS ROUTINELY RESET PASSWORDS AFTER MALWARE INFECTIONS**

**JUST 33% INVALIDATE EXPOSED USER SESSIONS AFTER MALWARE INFECTIONS**

In May, the FBI, Europol, and Microsoft announced a coordinated takedown of infrastructure related
to LummaC2. We saw a slight decrease in the number of new LummaC2 infections on the day of the
takedown, but after only a few days, the infection numbers rebounded, returning to similar levels as the
days leading up to the disruption, and there has been no slowing down since. As shown in the numbers on
the following page, Lumma still dominates the infostealer world in 2025.

LUMMAC2

INFOSTEALER MALWARE

STEALER VARIANTS
DAILY INFECTION COUNTS

As the single most prevalent infostealer threat globally, LummaC2 clocked over 23.3 million detections
in our recaptured data lake so far in 2025. To put this in perspective:

Peak activity: 204,045 detections in a single day in February 2025

Monthly volume: Peaked at 4.2 million detections in February 2025

Current trend: While showing a 31% decline from January to August, it maintains
massive volume with 1.9 million monthly detections by SpyCloud

And while Windows is overwhelmingly the target of commodity malware, devices running macOS
have seen notable increases in targeting this year as well, largely thanks to highly-available macOS
stealers like Atomic Stealer.

While showing significantly lower volume than Lumma infections (118,436 total detections), Atomic’s
behavior patterns suggest targeted campaigns rather than mass distribution:

Highly volatile activity with dramatic spikes and drops

Peak detection of 10,689 on a single day in August 2025

Monthly detections ranging from just 154 to over 33,000

What does this mean for defenders? Without question, macOS is being targeted as threat actors have
successfully industrialized attacks against Apple’s ecosystem. The data clearly shows we’re witnessing
a leveling in the infostealer ecosystem – one where platform diversity no longer provides protection,
and where identity-based threats have truly become platform-agnostic.

## THE CONFIDENCE TRAP: PERCEPTION VS. REALITY

From a distance, many organizations appear to be on course – fortified by dashboards, workflows,
and modern tooling. But beneath that polished exterior lies a disconnect between perceived readiness
and operational reality.

While 86% of organizations report feeling somewhat or very confident in their ability to prevent a
ransomware attack, 85% actually experienced an attempt or successful attack in the past year. Even
more concerning, 31% endured 6 to 10 separate incidents. The confidence is there, but the course is
far less stable than it seems.

**85% OF ORGANIZATIONS WERE AFFECTED BY RANSOMWARE IN THE PAST YEAR, AND 31% WERE AFFECTED 6-10 TIMES**

The confidence divide: Executives vs. Operators

The confidence paradox becomes sharper when you zoom in by role:

- 45% of CIOs and CISOs report feeling very confident in their ransomware defense capabilities
- But only 28% of security directors and team leads say the same

Practitioners – those in the trenches with alert fatigue, limited automation, manual workflows, and
inconsistent follow-through – see the cracks up close. They’re more likely to recognize where friction,
fatigue, and blind spots persist.

By contrast, executives often rely on reporting dashboards and compliance milestones. These optics
can obscure the deeper operational risks hiding in identity sprawl.

![Image of a bar graph showing frequency of ransomware incidents in the past year]

DEFENSE GAPS

ransomware incidents

**ONE-TIME** 37%
**2 TO 5 TIMES** 31%
**6 TO 10 TIMES** 12%
**MORE THAN 10 TIMES** 9%
**NOT AFFECTED BY RANSOMWARE IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS** 5%
**NOT AFFECTED BY RANSOMWARE, BUT MY ORG WAS AFFECTED BY EXTORTION ATTEMPTS** 4%
**DON’T KNOW** 2%

False assurance

Many teams treat successful audits or new tech investments as proof of readiness. But without the
supporting operational procedures, these become check-the-box exercises rather than pillars of
real security.

- Nearly two‑thirds of organizations lack repeatable workflows for identity exposure remediation.
- About two‑thirds have no formal investigation protocols for identity-related incidents.

These gaps mean even advanced tools struggle to prevent identity threats from spreading. They simply
generate alerts faster in an uncoordinated response environment.

Overestimating malware and phishing defenses

Phishing and malware remain among the most common initial access vectors, yet detection and response
practices are often incomplete or inconsistent.

- Only 41% of organizations consistently revoke or reset credentials after a phishing attack
- Just 54% routinely reset user passwords, and only 33% terminate active sessions

In both cases, basic security procedures – like resetting credentials after an infection – is often skipped.

These oversights create long-lived risks that threat actors are eager to exploit.

Ultimately, confidence without rigor creates complacency. It may feel stable until telemetry says
otherwise. And by then, it may be too late.

<a name="identity-black-holes-the-remediation-lag"></a>
## IDENTITY BLACK HOLES: THE REMEDIATION LAG

What makes identity exposure uniquely dangerous is its ability to penetrate an organization from
nearly any angle. And identity artifacts – harvested via phishing, malware, and credential stuffing –
require continuous monitoring and remediation to prevent abuse. It only takes one exposure to bring
down the ship.

Without full remediation, attackers can return or sell access to the same systems again and again,
escalating access, exfiltrating data, or planting malware with each visit. And yet, organizations are
still playing catch-up:

**ONLY 35% HAVE REPEATABLE WORKFLOWS TO REMEDIATE IDENTITY EXPOSURES**

**JUST 33% HAVE PROTOCOLS TO INVESTIGATE IDENTITY-RELATED INCIDENTS**

**A MERE 38% CAN DETECT HISTORICAL EXPOSURES THAT CREATE RISK DUE TO BEHAVIORS LIKE CREDENTIAL REUSE**

Remediation gaps that keep the doors open

Despite the scale of exposure, less than 20% are able to automate and optimize remediation across
systems. Workflows tend to break down at three key points:

1 | DISCOVERY
Alert fatigue and limited visibility delay the identification of exposed data.

2 | OWNERSHIP
Teams are often unsure who is responsible for what, especially when third-party accounts or
unmanaged devices are involved.

3 | CONSISTENCY
Without playbooks, some exposures are fully remediated while others are partially addressed or
missed entirely.

![Image of a bar graph showing organization's ability to remediate identity exposures]

**WE ARE DEVELOPING REPEATABLE REMEDIATION WORKFLOWS** 32%
**WE REGULARLY REMEDIATE BASED ON PRIORITIZED RISKS** 14%
**WE AUTOMATE AND OPTIMIZE REMEDIATION ACROSS SYSTEMS** 19%

Detection lags: Investigation without a manual

Beyond remediation, detection and investigation processes are also severely underdeveloped. Less
than 20% can conduct rapid investigations using integrated tools and analytics. That means most
responses are improvised, reactive, and siloed, leading to prolonged dwell times and a higher risk of
follow-on attacks.

This lack of structure is especially problematic for large or hybrid organizations, where exposures may
cross multiple systems, teams, or geographies. In these environments, a stolen credential or phished
token can quietly enable a campaign of lateral movement, surveillance, and data collection before
anyone notices.

<a name="crash-landing-the-fallout-of-malware-and-ransomware"></a>
## CRASH LANDING: THE FALLOUT OF MALWARE AND RANSOMWARE

Ransomware and identity-driven attacks don’t just inflict damage during the incident – they trigger a
cascade of operational and reputational fallout that lasts long after the event is contained. The true
cost isn’t just the ransom. It’s the ripple effects.

![Image of a bar graph showing impacts experienced due to ransomware incidents]

IMPACTS
IMPACTS EXPERIENCED
DUE TO RANSOMWARE
INCIDENTS

**PRODUCTIVITY OR OPS DOWNTIME** 55%
**INCREASED RECOVERY AND INCIDENT RESPONSE** 51%
**BRAND OR REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE** 50%
**FINANCIAL / LEGAL PENALTIES** 46%
**CUSTOMER CHURN OR TRUST LOSS** 42%
**NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT** 3%

Last year, 56% of organizations we surveyed reported ransomware-related costs exceeding $1
million. Even when no ransom is paid, expenses from system restoration, forensic investigations, and
compliance reporting can quickly spiral.

But the toll extends beyond the balance sheet. Fifty-five percent of organizations experienced
significant operational downtime, grinding business operations to a halt and disrupting critical
services. For industries like finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, that disruption can be more
than just costly – it can be dangerous.

At the same time, brand trust takes a hit. Fifty percent of organizations cited significant reputational
damage after an attack. Lost customer confidence, delayed sales cycles, and investor skepticism
become silent taxations on future growth. And unlike system recovery, rebuilding trust isn’t governed
by SLAs.

Similar impacts were experienced for malware incidents. Ninety-three percent of organizations
suffered some significant impact, with over half of organizations experiencing increased recovery and
incident response costs.

These outcomes aren’t limited to catastrophic events – they increasingly reflect the everyday cost
of incomplete identity hygiene and delayed remediation. Without robust credential reset processes,
session invalidation, and automated workflows, organizations stay stuck in reactive mode. And that’s
