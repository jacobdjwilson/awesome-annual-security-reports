## Introduction
Over the past decade, organizations have steadily increased their privacy resources and investments. While initially driven by the necessity of compliance, these efforts have revealed the broader value of privacy as a cornerstone for earning, building, and maintaining customer trust. With the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), organizations face the next chapter in their privacy journey. The 2025 Data Privacy Benchmark Study explores key themes shaping the industry today: an emphasis on data localization alongside a preference for global providers, the trust-building power of privacy regulations, and the intersection of privacy and AI governance.

### Methodology
This report draws upon data gathered in fall 2024 from an anonymous survey of security and privacy professionals in which the respondents did not know who was conducting the study and respondents were similarly unknown to the researchers. The survey included 2600+ respondents in 12 countries (5 Europe, 4 Asia, and 3 Americas).[^1] They were asked about their organizations’ privacy practices and spending, reactions to privacy legislation, AI, and data localization requirements. The findings from this research demonstrate the continuing importance of privacy to businesses and how they serve their customers.

### Key findings:
1. Amid global focus on data and AI, 90% of respondents believe storing data locally is inherently safer. And yet, 91% believe global providers are better at protecting data compared to local providers.
2. Support for privacy laws continues to grow with 86% (up 6% year over year) of organizations indicating legislation has had a positive impact.
3. Organizations continue to see the value generated from privacy investments. Funding remained steady year over year with 96% of respondents noting that the benefits outweigh the cost.
4. Familiarity with and value from AI are increasing, but concerns with potential risks remain. Interestingly, concerns around legal risks have decreased as respondents grow more familiar with the novel technology and have implemented AI governance frameworks.
5. Realizing the potential of AI, organizations expect AI focus and budgets to grow. This growth intersects with the ongoing needs of maintaining robust data privacy and cybersecurity programs.

## Results

### 1. Perceptions around data safety and security drive localization
For decades, the digital economy has played a key role in driving economic growth with businesses across various sizes and sectors relying on data movement around the world. And yet, in recent years, there has been an increased focus on data localization in many geographies. Similar to
