## Introduction
Over the past decade, organizations have steadily increased their privacy resources and investments. While initially driven by the necessity of compliance, these efforts have revealed the broader value of privacy as a cornerstone for earning, building, and maintaining customer trust. With the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), organizations face the next chapter in their privacy journey. The 2025 Data Privacy Benchmark Study explores key themes shaping the industry today: an emphasis on data localization alongside a preference for global providers, the trust-building power of privacy regulations, and the intersection of privacy and AI governance.

### Methodology
This report draws upon data gathered in fall 2024 from an anonymous survey of security and privacy professionals in which the respondents did not know who was conducting the study and respondents were similarly unknown to the researchers. The survey included 2600+ respondents in 12 countries (5 Europe, 4 Asia, and 3 Americas).[^1] They were asked about their organizations’ privacy practices and spending, reactions to privacy legislation, AI, and data localization requirements. The findings from this research demonstrate the continuing importance of privacy to businesses and how they serve their customers.

### Key findings:
1.  Amid global focus on data and AI, 90% of respondents believe storing data locally is inherently safer. And yet, 91% believe global providers are better at protecting data compared to local providers.
2.  Support for privacy laws continues to grow with 86% (up 6% year over year) of organizations indicating legislation has had a positive impact.
3.  Organizations continue to see the value generated from privacy investments. Funding remained steady year over year with 96% of respondents noting that the benefits outweigh the cost.
4.  Familiarity with and value from AI are increasing, but concerns with potential risks remain. Interestingly, concerns around legal risks have decreased as respondents grow more familiar with the novel technology and have implemented AI governance frameworks.
5.  Realizing the potential of AI, organizations expect AI focus and budgets to grow. This growth intersects with the ongoing needs of maintaining robust data privacy and cybersecurity programs.

## Results

### 1. Perceptions around data safety and security drive localization
For decades, the digital economy has played a key role in driving economic growth with businesses across various sizes and sectors relying on data movement around the world. And yet, in recent years, there has been an increased focus on data localization in many geographies. Similar to the Cisco 2024 Data Privacy Benchmark Study, the vast majority of respondents (90%) indicated a belief that data would be safer when stored locally within their own country’s borders. When asked if localizing their data comes with significant cost—regardless of provider —88% said yes, compared with 85% in 2023. These two responses together indicate a willingness to spend more to keep data local. See Figure 1.

A slightly higher percentage of respondents (91%) also believe that global providers would better protect their data compared to a local provider serving a specific country or region. Notably, this percentage is up five points from last year. This increase may reflect the growing trend of multinational providers introducing in-region data storage capabilities, allowing respondents to reap the benefits of both global scale and expertise while meeting specific data residency preferences and requirements. And, while it might initially appear paradoxical to see strong, equally weighted preferences for both data localization and global providers, the results are logical in today’s landscape. As data becomes an increasingly valuable asset, both companies and consumers expect—and demand—robust protective measures. See Figure 2.

![Figure 2: Line graph showing an increase from 86% in 2023 to 91% in 2024 of respondents who believe global providers can protect data better than local providers.]

Additionally, with the varying approaches to data localization across countries, one might expect preference for global data providers to differ based on local regulation. But preference for global providers over local ones remains relatively consistent across the surveyed regions. See Figure 3.

While respondents expressed a strong belief that data stored locally is safer, navigating differing regulatory regimes raises complexities for global businesses. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), more than 100 data localization requirements exist across 40 countries.[^2] Amid this rise in localization, some governments are working to enable interoperable data flows through trade and digital agreements that are based on a consistent foundation of data protection. The G20’s Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) initiative (supported by the OECD), the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules Forum, EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and others, aim to make national data governance systems interoperable and prohibit strict data and infrastructure localization. When respondents were asked if Data Free Flow with Trust could boost economic growth, 85% agreed, highlighting the interest and need for organizations to find safe ways to continue enabling cross-border data flows that are critical for today’s global, digital economy. See Figure 4.

### 2. Regulation continues to be a trust driver
While compliance with privacy laws does require investment—a theme explored later in this report—these regulations are widely seen as beneficial, notably for providing a structured framework that boosts trust and credibility with customers. This positive view is supported by data, showing that 86% of respondents reported a positive impact from privacy laws on their organization, up from 80% in the Cisco 2024 Data Privacy Benchmark Study. See Figure 5.

Drawing insights from the Cisco 2024 Consumer Privacy Survey adds a fascinating layer of context to this data. For the first time since the consumer survey’s inception in 2019, a majority of global consumers (53%) reported being aware of their country’s privacy laws. Awareness of privacy laws highly correlates with consumer confidence. Among respondents who were not aware of their country’s privacy laws, only 44% said they are able to protect their personal data. By contrast, among those who are aware of these laws, 81% said they can protect their data, emphasizing the role of regulation as a trust driver for consumers. See Figures 6 and 7.

### 3. Privacy investments deliver organization benefits
Significant resources are required to comply with data privacy regulations—including cataloging data, implementing controls, conducting impact assessments and interests balancing, and enhancing lines of communication with customers and stakeholders—but most respondents understand the role regulation can play in creating business value. This year, 96% of respondents from the organizations surveyed said that the benefits from this investment outweigh the costs. See Figure 8.

![Figure 8: Bar chart showing 96% of respondents agree that the benefits from privacy investment outweigh the costs.]

Organizations’ appreciation for the benefits associated with compliance helps explain why overall spending on data privacy has remained consistent over the past four years, with an average spend of $2.7 million across the organizations represented. Medium-sized organizations (250-499 employees), larger organizations (500-999 employees), large enterprises (1,000-9,999 employees), and very large enterprises (10,000+ employees) have all increased their spending year over year. In contrast, smaller organizations (50-249 employees) have decreased their spending. See Figure 9.

![Figure 9: Line graph illustrating privacy spending in millions of dollars from 2021 to 2024, categorized by company size and overall average, showing consistent overall spending.]

As for the value of those investments, the majority of organizations surveyed (53%) reported an estimated 1x to 2x return (1.6x median) on investment from privacy spending. See Figure 10
