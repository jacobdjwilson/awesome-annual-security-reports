Cyber risk remains an unavoidable reality of doing business in a digitally connected world. Threat actors continue to demonstrate their relentlessness, evolving tactics to exploit new vulnerabilities and maximize financial gain.

In years past, Coalition witnessed this dynamic firsthand with cyber claims increasing in both frequency and severity across various industries and revenue segments. Yet in 2024, despite this ever-changing landscape, we observed remarkable year-over-year (YoY) stability, a clear testament to the power of Active Insurance.

What sets Active Insurance apart from others is our strategic underwriting, data-driven risk selection, real-time risk assessment, proactive policyholder engagement, rapid response times, human expertise, comprehensive coverage, and passion for going above and beyond the policy. This unique combination is why Coalition policyholders experience 73% fewer claims than the industry average.[^1]

Having engaged policyholders that regard cyber risk as an ongoing priority rather than a one-time concern is not coincidental: It’s a direct outcome from a novel approach. Businesses that recognize cyber insurance is more than just financial protection — but a true partnership in risk management — are proving to be more resilient in the face of evolving threats.

The most successful businesses are those that proactively invest in security controls, leverage access to real-time threat intelligence, and take action based on emerging risks rather than past events. The end result? Fewer attacks, less financial burden, and a stronger security posture.

Looking ahead, the path forward is clear: Prevention must be prioritized over reaction. The companies that embrace continuous cybersecurity improvements, strategic risk management, and early threat detection will be best positioned to withstand future attacks.

Meanwhile, Coalition recognizes that we must never be complacent. Instead, we continuously refine our own approach by leveraging predictive analytics, deepening our trust with policyholders and brokers, and introducing meaningful security solutions into every stage of the insurance lifecycle.

The future of cyber insurance will be shaped by the businesses, brokers, and insurance providers who choose to take action. Those who do will not only endure but emerge stronger.

## Executive Summary

About the 2025 Cyber Claims Report

This report features statistics, charts, and risk insights based on data from Coalition policyholders in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Cyber risk is a global matter, and the trends and risk mitigation strategies in this report are widely relevant and applicable across all geographic regions. Coalition is proud to share these insights to help businesses, brokers, and security professionals stay informed about the ever-changing cyber threat landscape.

[^1]: Industry average based on data reported by US insurers to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Comparison performed using 2023 claims frequency data from Coalition and NAIC. Claims frequency is calculated using the number of standalone cyber claims reported by the NAIC, divided by the average of standalone cyber policies in force at the current and prior year-ends.

## Global Highlights

Claims frequency decreased as email-based attacks persisted

As cyber threats continue to evolve, businesses that take a proactive approach to managing and mitigating risk are experiencing the greatest successes. In fact, 56% of all matters reported to Coalition were handled without any out-of-pocket payments by the policyholder.

Global claims frequency decreased 7% YoY in 2024 to 1.48% with a notable dip in the latter half of the year (Figure 1.1). Claims frequency in the US was higher (1.54%) than the global average in 2024. Frequency in Canada was notably lower (1.13%), as was frequency in the UK (1.09%).

Global claims severity remained stable YoY in 2024 with an average loss amount of $115,000, a significant amount for organizations of all sizes (Figure 1.2). Claims severity in the US was lower ($108,000) than the global average in 2024. Severity in Canada was nearly double the global average ($226,000), while the UK was significantly lower ($35,000). Across all regions, severity continued to be driven by ransomware, the most costly and disruptive of all cyber attacks.

Frequency & Severity Explained

Claims frequency refers to how often insurance claims are filed over a period of time.

Claims severity refers to the average cost per insurance claim.

Frequency and severity data can help businesses, brokers, and insurance providers determine the likelihood and financial impact of cyber attacks, as they are strong indicators not only of threat actor behaviors but also the collective security posture of organizations.

56%

Matters reported to Coalition that were handled without any out-of-pocket payments by the policyholder

![Image description: Global Claims Severity (Figure 1.2) +0.1% YoY change, graph showing claims severity from 2022-2024. 2022: $123,990, 2023: $107,675, 2024: $115,000]

Global claims severity includes funds transfer fraud (FTF) events in which a recovery was made. For additional insight into initial FTF claims severity, see Page 13. For more information, please see Methodology.

![Image description: Claims by Event Type (Figure 1.3) Pie chart showing the distribution of claims by event type. FTF: 29.8%, BEC: 29.7%, Ransomware: 21.1%, Misc. First-Party Loss: 11.8%, Other: 6.2%, Third-Party Allegations: 1.4%]

Email-based attacks led the way

Email-based attacks were ever-present in 2024, as business email compromise (BEC) and funds transfer fraud (FTF) events accounted for 60% of all cyber insurance claims — a trend that has generally persisted for the past three years (Figure 1.3). Ransomware events continued to hover around 20% of all claims, though the devastating impact of these events were felt most in terms of severity.

The percentage of reported claims in the US were nearly identical to global averages, though other geographical regions saw noteworthy deviations. BEC (28.6%) and FTF (24.5%) events accounted for more than half of all claims in Canada, though ransomware events (29.6%) were more prevalent than in other geographies. In the UK, BEC (46.4%) was the leading event type by a considerable margin, with FTF (25%) and ransomware (17.9%) trailing behind.

Miscellaneous First-Party Loss & Third-Party Allegations

The 2025 Cyber Claims Report features two new event types: miscellaneous first-party loss and third-party allegations. Each of these categories encompasses a variety of event types. Miscellaneous first-party loss includes system failures, security failures, third-party breaches, and more; third-party allegations include copyright infringement, domain impersonation, privacy rights violations, and more. See pages 19-21 for additional details.

## Claims by Industry

Sectors with less security awareness were more susceptible to attacks

Industries that handle sensitive financial data, personal health information, or intellectual property are often targeted by cyber criminals due to the high value of their data.

Industry plays a significant role in shaping a business’ overall cyber risk, influencing both the frequency and severity of cyber insurance claims.

Industries that handle sensitive financial data, personal health information, or intellectual property are often targeted by cyber criminals due to the high value of their data. Industries tied to critical infrastructure may also face heightened risks from state-sponsored attacks and ransomware campaigns that can disrupt essential operations. Meanwhile, industries with lower cybersecurity awareness may be more susceptible to opportunistic attacks, like phishing and credential theft.

Understanding industry-specific risks can empower businesses to tailor their cybersecurity strategies to address the most pressing threats they face.

Consumer Discretionary

Businesses in the consumer discretionary industry (automotive, hotels, retail, etc.) experienced a 2% increase YoY in claims frequency in 2024 to 1.33%, consistent with the industry’s average over the past three years. Claims severity for these businesses decreased 18% YoY to an average loss of $118,000. (See Figures 2.1 and 2.2 for all industries.)

Consumer Staples

Businesses in the consumer staples industry (agriculture, food and beverage, personal hygiene, etc.) experienced the highest claims frequency in 2024, increasing 17% YoY to 2.60% with an average of 2.29% over the past three years. Claims severity for these businesses plummeted 62% YoY to an average loss of $124,000, largely attributable to a sharp increase in the first half of 2023.

Energy

Businesses in the energy industry (electricity, oil and gas, renewables, etc.) saw a 6% YoY decrease in claims frequency in 2024 to 1.35%, part of a steady decline contributing to a three-year average of 1.44%. Due to volatility in the first half of 2024, claims severity for these businesses spiked more than 1,200% YoY to an average loss of $292,000, though historical severity sits around $108,000.

Financial Services

Businesses in the financial services industry (banks, investment firms, insurers, etc.) experienced a 17% YoY decrease in claims frequency in 2024 to 1.47% with an average of 1.53% over the past three years. Claims severity for these businesses decreased 2% YoY to an average loss of $95,000.

Healthcare

Businesses in the healthcare industry (hospitals, pharmacies, assisted care facilities, etc.) experienced a 19% YoY decrease in claims frequency in 2024 to 1.38% with an average of 1.45% over the past three years. Claims severity for these businesses increased 32% YoY to an average loss of $145,000.

Industrials

Businesses in the industrial industry (construction, manufacturing, engineering, etc.) saw a 4% YoY increase in claims frequency in 2024 to 1.64% with an average of 1.59% over the past three years. Claims severity for these businesses dipped 6% YoY to an average loss of $105,000, a figure that’s commensurate with historical industry averages.

Information Technology

Businesses in the information technology industry (hardware, software, managed services, etc.) experienced a 13% YoY decrease in claims frequency in 202 to 1.36% with an average of 1.46% over the past three years. Claims severity for these businesses increased 11% YoY to an average loss of $131,000, primarily due to a notable spike in the first half of 2024.

Materials

Businesses in the materials industry (mining, chemicals, plastics, etc.) saw a 32% decrease in claims frequency in 2024 to 2.20%, contributing to stability after a significant spike in the second half of 2023, with an average of 2.63% over the past three years. Claims severity for these businesses increased 10% YoY to an average loss of $99,000.

Nonprofit

Nonprofit organizations (charities, religious institutions, research facilities, etc.) saw a 1% YoY decrease in claims frequency in 2024 to 1.34% with a relatively steady average of 1.35% over the past three years. Claims severity for these organizations increased 12% YoY to an average loss of $73,000.

Real Estate

Businesses in the real estate industry (developers, property managers, brokerages, etc.) experienced a 24% decrease in claims frequency in 2024 to 1.02% with an average of 1.26% over the past three years. Claims severity for these organizations increased 58% YoY to an average loss of $179,000, largely driven by a spike in the first half of 2024.

## Claims by Revenue Amount

Frequency decreased year-over-year across all segments

Small and midsize businesses often face devastating financial consequences from cyber attacks due to limited resources and in-house security expertise.

Cyber risk impacts businesses differently based on their size, complexity, and resources. These factors have a direct influence on businesses' overall exposure, the types of threats they face, and their ability to recover after an incident.

Small and midsize businesses (SMBs) often face devastating financial consequences from cyber attacks due to limited resources and in-house security expertise. Larger organizations, on the other hand, may have more sophisticated security programs but face highly targeted attacks due to their vast digital footprint and the volume of sensitive data they possess.

Cyber claims by revenue: Less than $25M

Claims frequency among businesses with less than $25 million in revenue (<$25M) decreased 4% YoY in 2024 to 1.07%, averaging out to 1.08% over the past three years (Figure 3.1). Although they experienced the lowest frequency of all revenue amounts, businesses <$25M in revenue represented 64% of total claims in 2024.

Businesses <$25M in revenue experienced an 8% YoY decrease in claims severity in 2024 to an average loss of $79,000 (Figure 3.2). The trend was primarily driven by a dip in the first half of the year, though the average loss amount remained stable over a three-year period.

![Image description: Claims Frequency: <$25M (Figure 3.1) -4% YoY change, graph showing claims frequency from 2022-2024. 2022: 1.15%, 2023: 1.10%, 2024: 1.07%]

![Image description: Claims Severity: <$25M (Figure 3.2) -8% YoY change, graph showing claims severity from 2022-2024. 2022: $89,485, 2023: $83,540, 2024: $79,000]

Cyber claims by revenue: $25M-$100M

Among businesses between $25 million and $100 million in revenue ($25M-$100M), claims frequency decreased 5% YoY in 2024 to 3.99% for a three-year average of 3.87% (Figure 3.3). This segment has seen greater volatility in frequency in recent years and represented 20% of total claims in 2024.

Claims severity among businesses $25M-$100M in revenue decreased 1% YoY in 2024 to an average loss of $139,000 (Figure 3.4). The slight decline was attributable to a higher-than-normal severity in the first half of 2023, though severity has been trending upward in recent months.

![Image description: Claims Frequency: $25M-$100M (Figure 3.3) -5% YoY change, graph showing claims frequency from 2022-2024. 2022: 4.47%, 2023: 4.26%, 2024: 3.99%]

![Image description: Claims Severity: $25M-$100M (Figure 3.4) -1% YoY change, graph showing claims severity from 2022-2024. 2022: $167,281, 2023: $149,443, 2024: $139,000]

Cyber claims by revenue: $100M+

Businesses with more than $100 million in revenue ($100M+) experienced a 6% YoY decrease in claims frequency in 2024 to 5.97% with an average of 6.06% over the past three years (Figure 3.5). Despite the dip in frequency, larger businesses experienced claims more often than their smaller counterparts.

Claims severity among businesses with $100M+ in revenue jumped 21% YoY in 2024 to an average loss of $228,000 (Figure 3.6). The increase was driven by a significant spike in the first half of the year and a considerable drop in the second half, a trend that’s persisted over the past two years.

![Image description: Claims Frequency: $100M+ (Figure 3.5) -6% YoY change, graph showing claims frequency from 2022-2024. 2022: 6.62%, 2023: 6.51%, 2024: 5.97%]

## Business Email Compromise

Spike in severity partly driven by prices related to mitigation & recovery

BEC claims severity increased 23% YoY to an average loss of $35,000, primarily driven by a spike in the latter half of 2024.

Business email compromise (BEC) is an event in which cyber criminals gain access to an organization’s email account to execute a cyber attack. Attackers often leverage email access to find sensitive data, including login credentials, financials, and other private information. Once equipped with sensitive information, they can steal money, extract data for extortion, or compromise additional technologies.

BEC claims frequency remained stable in 2024 at 0.44%, seeing no YoY change, and has continued to hover at 0.43% over the past three years (Figure 4.1). BEC claims frequency in the US (0.44%) was on par with the global average in 2024. Frequency in Canada was lower (0.32%), while frequency in the UK was higher (0.51%).

BEC claims severity increased 23% YoY to an average loss of $35,000, primarily driven by a spike in the latter half of 2024 (Figure 4.2). BEC claims severity in the US was higher ($36,000) than the global average, while both Canada and the UK were notably lower ($22,000). The spike in BEC severity was, in part, driven by increased prices related to legal expenses, incident response firms, data mining, notifications, and other mitigation and recovery efforts.

![Image description: BEC Claims Frequency (Figure 4.1) No YoY change, graph showing claims frequency from 2022-2024. 2022: 0.44%, 2023: 0.41%, 2024: 0.44%]

![Image description: BEC Claims Severity (Figure 4.2) +23% YoY change, graph showing claims severity from 2022-2024. 2022: $25,738, 2023: $28,469, 2024: $35,000]

Business email compromise (BEC) events that resulted in funds transfer fraud (FTF) are classified as FTF events and, thus, not calculated into BEC severity. For more information, please see Methodology.

## Funds Transfer Fraud

Decrease in initial severity attributable to observed changes in behavior by threat actors & financial institutions

FTF events often occur through social engineering tactics or as a direct result of a BEC event.

The typical funds transfer fraud (FTF) is an event in which cyber criminals manipulate businesses into unknowingly sending money to fraudulent accounts controlled by cyber criminals. FTF events often occur through social engineering tactics or as a direct result of a BEC event: Attackers may pose as executives, vendors, or financial institutions to trick employees into initiating unauthorized wire transfers that can have devastating consequences for businesses.

FTF claims frequency decreased 2% YoY in 2024 to 0.44% and has continued to hover at 0.44% over the past three years (Figure 5.1). FTF claims frequency in the US (0.47%) was higher than the global average in 2024. Frequency in Canada was lower (0.32%), as was frequency in the UK (0.27%).

FTF initial claims severity[^4] decreased 46% YoY in 2024 to an average loss of $185,000 (Figure 5.2). The sharp decline followed an all-time high in 2023, when FTF initial severity for the entire year topped $340,000.

![Image description: FTF Claims Frequency (Figure 5.1) -2% YoY change, graph showing claims frequency from 2022-2024. 2022: 0.48%, 2023: 0.43%, 2024: 0.44%]

![Image description: FTF Initial Claims Severity (Figure 5.2) -46% YoY change, graph showing claims severity from 2022-2024. 2022: $361,286, 2023: $340,909, 2024: $185,000]

[^4]: FTF initial claims severity excludes all financial recoveries (“clawbacks”) to illustrate the true impact of FTF events prior to Coalition intervention.

Business email compromise (BEC) events that resulted in funds transfer fraud (FTF) are classified as FTF events and, thus, calculated into FTF severity. For more information, please see Methodology.

Coalition has observed fewer FTF attempts with high six-figure and seven-figure dollar amounts.

The significant decrease in FTF initial severity may be explained by changes in behaviors by both threat actors and financial institutions. Coalition has observed fewer FTF attempts with high six-figure and seven-figure dollar amounts, possibly as a result of financial institutions flagging large transactions and holding them for an extended period of time.

However, FTF initial severity has been historically subject to volatility. It’s not uncommon for the initial loss amount in an FTF event to exceed $1 million — in the back half of 2024, Coalition was alerted to a fraudulent transfer of $9.3 million that was ultimately recovered.

Business Email Compromise Led to Funds Transfer Fraud

Across all BEC events in 2024, 29% resulted in an FTF event with an average loss of $106,000.

CASE STUDY

Coalition claws back $2.1M fraudulent wire transfer after threat actor spoofed email

A distributor of household and personal goods attempted to wire a $2.1 million payment to its landlord for a new lease, but unknowingly sent the funds to a threat actor.

Soon after wiring the money, the business realized the money had been sent to a fraudster and notified Coalition. In under one hour, Coalition made contact with the business and notified government contacts for assistance in freezing the assets. Less than 24 hours later, all but roughly $100 of the funds were frozen and held for return to the distributor.

Coalition Incident Response (CIR)[^6] conducted a forensic investigation and determined no unauthorized access to the business’ email account occurred: The fraudulent transfer was triggered by a spoofed email.

After the business paid its $100,000 self-insured retention, Breach Response coverage responded to $7,200 in CIR services and another $4,500 in breach counsel fees. Because nearly all of the stolen funds were recovered and returned to the business, Funds Transfer Fraud coverage wasn’t triggered.

[^6]: Coalition Incident Response services provided through Coalition’s wholly owned affiliate are offered to policyholders as an option via incident response firm panel.

Coalition recovered $31 million on behalf of policyholders

When a policyholder reports an FTF event to Coalition, we take swift action based on the options available within the jurisdiction and do everything possible to “claw back” stolen money before it leaves the country of origin. These options include alerting government contacts, obtaining injunctions to freeze the stolen funds, or engaging panel firms to return money to the policyholder.

In 2024, Coalition’s cooperative efforts with authorities and panel partners contributed to the successful clawback of $31 million with an average recovery of $278,000.

Clawbacks are a critical and time-sensitive process for Coalition. Policyholders that quickly report FTF events to Coalition have a greater likelihood of recovery. In 2024, Coalition policyholders made a partial recovery in 24% of all reported FTF events and a full recovery in 12% of reported events.

In 2024, Coalition’s cooperative efforts with authorities and panel partners contributed to the successful clawback of $31 million with an average recovery of $278,000.

## Ransomware

Frequency & severity decreased alongside dip in initial ransom demands

Ransomware claims severity decreased 7% YoY in 2024 to an average loss of $292,000.

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a business’ data or systems, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to obtain a decryption key. Ransomware events can result in significant operational disruption and financial loss, regardless if a business chooses to pay a ransom demand, with costs including business interruption, forensic investigation, and data recovery.

Ransomware claims frequency decreased 3% YoY in 2024 to 0.31%, consistent with a three-year average of 0.31% (Figure 6.1). Ransomware claims frequency in the US was only slightly higher (0.32%) than the global average in 2024. Frequency in Canada was faintly higher (0.33%), while the UK was considerably lower (0.19%).

Ransomware claims severity decreased 7% YoY in 2024 to an average loss of $292,000, well below the high point of $393,000 in 2023 (Figure 6.2). Ransomware claims severity in the US was lower ($249,000) than the global average in 2024. Severity in Canada was more than double the global average ($665,000), though the UK was significantly lower ($82,000).

![Image description: Ransomware Claims Frequency (Figure 6.1) -3 YoY change, graph showing claims frequency from 2022-2024. 2022: 0.32%, 2023: 0.28%, 2024: 0.31%]

![Image description: Ransomware Claims Severity (Figure 6.2) -7% YoY change, graph showing claims severity from 2022-2024. 2022: $348,320, 2023: $393,245, 2024: $292,000]

Ransom demands decreased 22%

Perhaps the biggest driver of the dip in ransomware claims severity was the decrease in initial ransom demands. Ransom demands fell 22% YoY in 2024 to an average of $1.1 million (Figure 6.3). Notably, the average demand in the latter half of 2024 fell below $1 million for the first time in more than two years.

![Image description: Initial Ransom Demands (Figure 6.3) -22% YoY change, graph showing claims severity from 2022-2024. 2022: $1,378,924, 2023: $1,299,400, 2024: $1,100,000]

Drivers of Ransomware Loss

Ransom payments are often the largest contributor to ransomware claims severity but are only one aspect of the total loss amount. Costs related to business interruption, digital asset restoration, and forensic investigation are other key drivers.

CASE STUDY

Furniture manufacturer faces prolonged business interruption from ransomware attack

A furniture manufacturer learned it had been hit with a ransomware attack after discovering a ransom note on a company computer. Threat actors encrypted its data and rendered nearly all systems inoperable. The business contacted Coalition and quickly engaged Coalition Incident Response (CIR)[^6] for forensic investigation.

After exfiltrating data, threat actors contacted current and former employees and pressured the manufacturer to pay the ransom. Because all onsite backups were corrupted, the manufacturer decided to pay to prevent the leak of private data. CIR successfully negotiated the ransom demand down from $682,500 to $400,000, but the decryptor provided by threat actors was ineffective. CIR and restoration vendors provided hands-on support for one month to get the manufacturer operational. Ultimately, CIR determined that initial access was gained through remote desktop software.

After the manufacturer paid its $25,000 self-insured retention, Business Interruption coverage responded with $609,000 to help cover the extended downtime. Additional costs were covered through a separate $1 million limit for Breach Response coverage for notifications, data mining, and legal and forensic vendors.

Coalition negotiated 60% reduction in ransom payments

Akira ransomware was the most prolific ransomware variant among Coalition policyholders, accounting for 13% of all ransomware claims in 2024 with an average demand of $692,000 (Figure 6.4). Play ransomware was another notable variant, accounting for 6% of all ransomware claims with an average demand of $2.6 million. The Black Basta variant accounted for just 3% of all ransomware claims, but was the highest in terms of demand with an average of $4 million.

When deemed reasonable and necessary, 44% of policyholders that experienced a ransomware event opted to pay the ransom. In these cases, Coalition Incident Response directly engaged threat actors and, on average, successfully negotiated a 60% reduction in payment based on the initial demand.[^8]
