## About the research

Genetec Inc. surveyed physical security professionals from around the
world between August 12 to September 15, 2024. Following a review of
submissions and data cleansing, 5,696 respondents were included in the
sample for analysis.

The goal of the research was to:

*   Gain insights into physical security operations and environments in 2024
*   Identify the outlook for physical security projects for 2025
*   Understand upcoming challenges

### Summary of survey methodology

The target population for the survey focused on three main groups:

*   **End users**: Individuals working for organizations participating in the
    procurement, management, or use of physical security technology.
*   **Channel partners**: Individuals who consult, install, service, or produce physical
    security solutions.
*   **Consultants**: Individuals who consult on the design, installation, maintenance,
    and operation of physical security solutions.

*   The target population was reached through in-person events, and by third parties through
    their opt-in email lists, Genetec opt-in email lists, and by digital promotions.
*   One set of survey questions was asked to end users and a different set of questions was
    asked of channel partners and consultants.
*   This report points out whether answers are from end users, channel partners, consultants, or
    all respondents.
*   Only fully completed surveys submitted by individuals within the targeted population were
    included in the final analysis.
*   In most of the survey, there was little significant difference between the responses received
    from the different geographic regions. For more details about these differences see the
    “Summary of differences from around the world.”

## Executive summary

This year’s report documents interesting changes in the physical security
industry. Based on the data collected, we see some surprising shifts in
priorities and a renewed focus on operational excellence. In 2024:

*   57% of end users say the top challenges
    were aging outdated physical security and/or
    information technology (IT) infrastructure
*   65% of channel partners say their clients want to
    benefit from new tech and capabilities
*   66% of end users ranked access control (50%)
    and/or video surveillance (39%) as top processes
    or capabilities for the year. This aligned with 81% of
    channel partners’ work focusing on either of these
    core systems
*   49% of end users in 2024 reported 100%
    on-premises deployments of physical security
    (no cloud)
*   77% of end users say physical security and
    information technology (IT) departments
    work collaboratively

## Global key findings

### Economy impacts project timelines

49% of end users delayed projects in 2024 and 45% in 2023. But the reasons were
very different. In 2023 supply chain issues were the main reason, but in 2024 the
cause was economic uncertainties.

#### What do you expect could cause project delays in 2025?

![FIGURE B: TOP EXPECTED CAUSES FOR PROJECT DELAYS IN 2025.](Image description: A bar chart showing the top expected causes for project delays in 2025. The causes include Economic uncertainties/inflation, Attracting/hiring talent, Political uncertainties, Training and upskilling, Supply chain issues, Adapting to remote system configuration and management, Managing a remote workforce, We don't expect projects to be delayed in 2025, and Other.)

**Insights**
Political changes could also have played a role. Time magazine referred
to 2024 as being “the election year” with at least 64 countries including
the USA, India, Taiwan, South Korea, and the UK holding key national
elections in 2024.¹

¹ Elections Around the World in 2024 | TIME

---

### Recruiting challenges persist

Since 2021, both end users and channel partners have
consistently reported staffing issues. And the outlook
for 2025 points to ongoing concerns. 72% of channel
partners expect to continue to have hiring challenges
while only 6% believe it will improve.

*   76% of channel partners said that “Installation Technician” is the
    toughest role to fill

Channel partners also expect these talent shortages to
impact their projects, with 44% saying that attracting
and hiring workers will cause project delays in 2025.

#### HR challenges over the last 4 years

### Budgets adjust

Operational expenditure (OpEx) budgets in 2024
didn’t align with 2023 predictions, where over 50%
of respondents expected steady or increased OpEx
budgets. Instead, 44% reported an increase or steady
OpEx budget. Capital expenditure (CapEx) budgets also
held stable, with only 17% of end users noting a decrease.
Amid economic and political uncertainties, these slight
adjustments highlight the physical security industry’s
pragmatism and the essential role these systems play in
organizations worldwide.

*   48%
    of respondents stated
    that their CapEx budget
    increased or remained flat
    in 2024. Of this group 48%
    indicated that it increased
    between 11-25%

#### OpEx budget survey data over 3 years

![FIGURE D: PROPORTION OF RESPONDENTS REPORTING OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURE BUDGETS INCREASED, REMAINED FLAT, OR
DECREASED (2022-2024).](Image description: A bar chart showing the proportion of respondents reporting operational expenditure budgets increased, remained flat, or decreased from 2022 to 2024.)

---

### Cyber resilience remains a priority

As cyber threats continue to rise, more end users
are taking action to strengthen their cybersecurity.
Organizations are using guidance from industry
regulations and cybersecurity partners that have the
expertise to create plans and put them into motion.

*   38%
    of consultants indicated that
    they’re planning to grow their
    coverage into cybersecurity

#### Top cybersecurity practices implemented

*   Educating users on cybersecurity best practices
*   Fine-tuning user permissions and privileges
*   Securing data storage
*   Hardening security infrastructure
*   Protecting the system from unauthorized access

![FIGURE E: PROPORTION OF RESPONDENTS THAT IMPLEMENTED CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES (2023-2024).](Image description: A bar chart comparing the proportion of respondents that implemented cybersecurity practices in 2023 and 2024.)

Industry regulations are also propelling improvements in data protection and cyber
resilience. In 2024, 67% of end users said their organization was affected by these
regulations, a big jump from just 13% in 2023. Examples like NIS2 compliance, GDPR,
and other industry-specific rules were repeatedly mentioned.

### Cloud adoption meets physical security realities

Cloud adoption in the physical security industry grew fast between 2022 and 2023
while results in the most recent 2024 survey revealed a deceleration. In 2024, 38% of
end users reported that over 25% of their physical security environment was cloud or
hybrid cloud – down 6% from 2023.

#### Timeline towards the cloud

*   22% - Do not know
*   17% - Plan to have no systems in the cloud
*   43% - Are moving towards a blend of on-premises and cloud-based solutions
*   18% - Plan to have all systems in the cloud

![FIGURE G: PROPORTIONS OF RESPONDENTS PLANNING TO INCORPORATE CLOUD.](Image description: A pie chart showing the proportions of respondents planning to incorporate cloud solutions.)

When end users were asked what has impacted their organization’s adoption of cloud
solutions, budgetary reasons related to “cloud storage, data retention, and bandwidth
costs” were reported. “Fear of data loss and overall control” was their second reason,
further demonstrating that physical security practitioners are looking to move
workloads to the cloud in an incremental fashion, at a pace suitable for their business.

---

#### Balancing cloud adoption and cloud costs

Organizations with smaller physical security systems are more likely to use the cloud
for storage, while those with larger systems are not adopting as fast. In fact, 41% of
all respondents say they’ve slowed their cloud adoption due to costs for storage, data
retention, and bandwidth.

#### Where organizations store video (by size of system)

![FIGURE H: DISTRIBUTION OF CAMERAS STORED LOCALLY, ON-PREMISES, OR IN THE CLOUD.](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the distribution of video storage locations (private cloud, on-premises, hybrid, camera internal storage, VMS provider cloud, unable to disclose/unknown) across different system sizes (up to 100 cameras, 101-1,000 cameras, over 1,000 cameras).)

Indicators point to smaller organizations with less storage and bandwidth concerns
benefiting more quickly from the convenience and accessibility of video surveillance as
a service (VSaaS). In the face of deploying larger, more complex systems to the cloud,
it’s not surprising organizations are reviewing their investments in advance of starting
work, or as the data comes in from early deployments. The need to find an optimal ROI
in the cloud has become a pressing issue.

It is clear that managing cloud expenses is an emerging challenge in physical security
and the issue of cloud waste is one that organizations are beginning to look at closely.

**Insights**
Most organizations lack proactive cloud cost-saving strategies

A Gartner survey shows that companies waste an average of 35% of their cloud
spending, with waste levels ranging from 15% in well-optimized environments to 55%
in unoptimized ones.

---

#### Cloud outlook is bright for hybrid deployments

##### 2024 cloud adoption

![FIGURE I: CLOUD ADOPTION FOR PHYSICAL SECURITY DEPLOYMENTS.](Image description: A bar chart showing cloud adoption for physical security deployments.)

Looking at the future of cloud adoption, it’s clear from the 2024 survey results that the
majority of organizations see the best way to leverage cloud successfully is through
hybrid deployments. Smaller organizations, with presumably less hardware, retention,
and data concerns, are predictably more interested and open to full cloud deployments.

#### Target vision for cloud deployment over next 5 years

![FIGURE J: FORECAST OF CLOUD DEPLOYMENT TYPE BY ORGANIZATION SIZE.](Image description: A stacked bar chart forecasting the type of cloud deployment (All cloud, On-premises only, Hybrid) by organization size (1-200 employees, 201-10,000 employees, 10,001+ employees).)

---

#### Channel partners

Channel partners are also positive about the value of cloud-based physical
security systems:

*   78% felt there would be an
    increase in new cloud systems
    in 2025, up from 73% last year
*   2% expect a decrease,
    down from 5% last year

#### Consultants

Physical security consultants also predict cloud deployments will continue to grow:

*   58% estimate that the typical
    timeline for their customers to
    move some workloads to the
    cloud would be within the next
    12 months
*   66% say they would specify hybrid-
    cloud security deployments
    over the next 5 years
*   25% expect to specify full
    cloud deployments

---

### Improvements of core systems continue

In 2024, 58% of channel partners saw an increase in end users “adding new
technologies to existing systems, including cloud solutions”. But looking ahead to
2025, 51% of end users responded that they’re going to focus on leveraging existing
technology like cybersecurity tools, data analysis, and improving departmental
collaboration. This demonstrates that end users are looking to extract value from their
existing systems and investments in new technology.

When asked to prioritize projects for 2025, all respondents put access control and
video surveillance at the top of the list.

#### What projects will be the focus for 2025?

![FIGURE J: TOP PROJECTS CONSULTANTS, CHANNEL PARTNERS, AND END USERS ARE PRIORITIZING IN 2025.](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the top projects consultants, channel partners, and end users are prioritizing in 2025. Projects include Access control, Video surveillance, Cybersecurity tools, Data analysis and visualization tools, Collaborating with other departments, Artificial intelligence (AI), and/or large language model (LLM), Incident management, Visitor management solutions, Intrusion detection, and License plate recognition.)

**Insights**
55% of consultants indicated their customers plan to leverage current
technology to address new challenges and evaluate new systems for specific
use cases.

#### Access control investments

When it comes to access control, end users want to do more with their technology.
Traditionally focused on restricting unauthorized access, end users are looking to
build additional functionalities that create efficiencies and deliver a more modern
approach to access. Visitor management (41%), biometrics (39%), and identity
management (37%) top the list for new access control investments in 2025.

#### Top access control investments planned for 2025

![FIGURE K: DISTRIBUTION OF INTEREST IN VARIOUS ACCESS CONTROL TECHNOLOGY FOR 2025.](Image description: A bar chart showing the distribution of interest in various access control technologies for 2025, including Visitor management, Biometrics, Identity management, Intelligent locks and keys, and Mobile credentials.)

#### Video surveillance updates

On the video surveillance front, channel partners said end users are focused on
cameras and video management systems (VMS) as key areas within legacy physical
security systems to replace or update in 2025. They also reported their customers want
to replace legacy systems in order to integrate new technology and get access to new
capabilities, such as:

*   Higher quality video
*   Streamlined VMS interface
*   Intelligent features in video analytics powered by deep learning

---

### End users make the most of security data

The trend related to gathering, using, and sharing security data to improve physical
security and/or business operations continued in this year’s survey responses. Both
end users and consultants agreed on the growing interest and use of this information
across key departments.

#### Departments that have access to physical security data

¹ Consultants were providing their view of their customers’ physical security data. Respondents could select multiple options.

![FIGURE L: DISTRIBUTION OF END USER AND CONSULTANT DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO SECURITY DATA.](Image description: A bar chart showing the distribution of departments that have access to physical security data, as reported by end users and consultants. Departments include Facilities, Security operations, Physical security, Executive leadership, and IT.)

Physical security data is essential for shaping strategy and aligning security with
business goals. Survey responses reveal that executive leaders view this data as
crucial to achieving broader business objectives. Leveraging the data available
in their systems allows physical security departments to play a critical role in
empowering their organization’s overall success as well as its safety and security.

---

Strategic use of security data is growing with end users wanting to improve cross-
departmental work and availability of data:

*   23% Want data analysis
    and visualization tools
*   22% Want collaboration with
    other departments for
    other business outcomes
*   22% Want security data
    democratization across the
    organization and better reporting

In their Security Operations Centers (SOCs), end users are also looking beyond
traditional data and tasks, continuing to integrate other data to better observe,
measure, and react to incidents, events, and operational requirements.

#### Most common data collected from other systems to use in SOCs

![FIGURE M: DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA MANAGED IN A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER IN 2024.](Image description: A bar chart showing the distribution of different types of data managed in a Security Operations Center in 2024, including Cybersecurity monitoring/threat data, Human resources data, External threat analysis, IT resources data, Operational data, Traffic flow data, Occupancy data, Fleet management data, Lone worker alarms, Lighting data, HVAC data, Other, and None.)

### Understanding the value of AI

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into physical security systems is a
promising development and one end users are eager to explore (10% did in 2024
and 37% plan to in 2025).

But figuring out where it delivers real improvements is a challenge with 27% of
end users responding that they are unsure how to deploy AI in a way that adds
value. 40+% of channel partners say end users want training to better understand
the technology.

Of those end users that have actively engaged with the technology, most believe
the value of AI will result from helping them streamline and automate different
aspects of their security operations.

#### What end users are trying to achieve with AI

![FIGURE N: DISTRIBUTION OF GOALS FOR USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS IN 2024.](Image description: A bar chart showing the distribution of goals for using artificial intelligence applications in 2024, including Automatically trigger events of interest, Automate emergency response dispatch, Forecast future threats or events of interest, Automatically filter and classify events for human assessment, Identify potential operating procedure improvements, Fully automate repetitive tasks, Use existing audio, video, or text to generate transcription and/or reports, and Other.)

---

At the same time, 75% of end users expressed concerns about how AI is designed
and implemented. These challenges are important for manufacturers and channel
partners to address to help stimulate AI adoption and utilization in the years to come.

*   75% of end users have concerns
    about AI design and
    implementation, particularly
    around responsible and
    ethical guidelines
*   48% of channel partners said that
    end users are concerned about
    vendors that don’t follow
    Responsible AI guidelines

### IT involved in physical security decisions

Information technology (IT) continues to play a bigger role in managing and deciding
on physical security systems. When respondents were asked which departments were
most involved in buying decisions, IT departments consistently ranked above physical
security departments.

With many departments involved in the physical security buying process,
respondents also highlighted the importance of executive leadership in these often
mission crucial buying decisions – most notably raised by end users.

#### Top 3 departments involved in 2024 purchasing decisions ¹

>
> – Michel Chalouhi, Vice-President of Global Sales,
> Genetec Inc.

---

Unsurprisingly, respondents to the survey working in IT and physical security
departments had different priorities related to technology deployment. In 2024, 47%
of IT professionals focused on deploying cybersecurity tools, compared to 27% of
security and safety professionals. Similarly, 37% of IT respondents flagged cloud-
based solutions as a priority, compared to 27% from physical security respondents.

#### Physical security versus IT respondents

![FIGURE P: DISTRIBUTION OF TOP PRIORITIES FOR IT TEAMS VS PHSYICAL SECURITY TEAMS.](Image description: A bar chart comparing the top priorities for IT teams versus physical security teams, including Leading with cloud-based solutions, 2024 projects delayed or downsized, and Experienced increase in physical or cyber incidents in 2024.)

## Key takeaways

### Takeaway 1
**Practicality over hype**

Coming out of the market uncertainties
of 2024, end users are making practical
plans for 2025. They’re looking for
reliable, value-driven solutions that
enhance security without introducing
unnecessary complexity or costs.
The industry-wide focus is shifting to
technology that meets day-to-day needs,
while they continue to track innovative
technology closely to gauge when it is
right for them to implement.

At the heart of priorities and budget,
is the ongoing need to build reliable
access control and video surveillance
systems. These remain the top of mind
for physical security departments.
Organizations are focusing on ways to
adopt new technology into their existing
infrastructure to help them improve
operations, increase cyber resiliency, and
deliver physical security in a more cost-
efficient way.

The desire to innovate, adopt new
technology, and deploy physical security
in new ways persists, however, end users
are looking for real-world solutions that
can reliably improve their work and
efficiency within their budget. The move
to the cloud and adoption of AI tools
remain top of mind but are grounded in
business realities resulting in prioritizing
hybrid-cloud deployments and a
measured approach to finding strong use
cases for new technology.

*   **Access
    control #1**
    Access control is the top priority
    for the 5th year running. Projects
    focused on video surveillance
    ranked second.

---

### Takeaway 2
**IT shapes decision-making**

IT’s role is to protect digital networks and keep data
safe. Physical security protects people, buildings,
and other assets. But today these roles are more
interconnected than ever. Results of the survey
show that this partnership has resulted in greater
collaboration with IT in buying decisions.

By combining expertise, these teams work together
to the benefit of the organization to navigate the
complexities of technology evaluation, and support
the many parties involved in the buying process.
Together, IT and physical security teams can bring
a more complete security approach by combining the
threat assessment and response expertise of physical
security professionals with IT’s specialized skills in
network design, data analytics, and cybersecurity. This
collaboration strengthens both organizational safety,
network security and operational efficiency, creating
a more resilient and unified security posture.

*   50+%
    of all respondents say IT departments are
    involved in purchasing decisions.

---

### Takeaway 3
**From cost center to ROI**

Physical security data is now commonly shared with
IT departments but beyond this, there may be limited
knowledge of its contents in an organization. With IT
holding the keys to physical security and often system
integration requests, physical security department
leaders may not fully understand or control the
additional organizational value that can be derived from
their own systems.

Integrations between security systems, other
IoT devices, and operational technologies can
fundamentally provide value to business operations.
Investment is required to identify problems and explore
beneficial integrations and data sources from existing
systems. When this concept is embraced it can turn
a traditional cost center like physical security into a
return on investment when its data is used to drive
business decisions. This fact opens the door to the
physical security team helping and influencing broader
organizational strategy and decision-making.

*   22%
    of end users plan to focus
    on security data access and
    better reporting in 2025.

## Summary of differences
around the world

The survey analysis looked at the six following major geographic regions:

*   Asia-Pacific
*   Australia, New Zealand, and the rest of Oceania
*   Europe
*   Latin America
*   Middle East, Turkey, and Africa
*   USA and Canada

This section documents some interesting examples where the survey responses from
a given region varied from the global average.

---

### Australia, New Zealand,
and the rest of Oceania

*   **Cloud use is lower due to concerns regarding
    in-country hosting.**
    *   Highest percentage of physical
        security remaining on-premises: Over
        62% of end users stated they were
        not currently using any cloud in the
        physical security environment.
    *   Lack of local data center infrastructure
        in the Australian and New Zealand
        region is more likely to slow cloud
        adoption: 21% of end users cited “no
        data center infrastructure in my region”
        as a reason for slowing their cloud
        adoption. The global average was 6%
        and no more than 8% of end users in any
        other region selected this reason.

### Asia-Pacific

*   **Minimal disruption of 2024 projects, strong
    cloud and hybrid-cloud adoption in physical
    security environments.**
    *   High hybrid-cloud use in physical
        security environments: End users from
        Asia-Pacific reported the highest use of
        hybrid-cloud overall across all regions.
        Only 40% of end users describe their
        physical security environment as
        entirely on-premises.
    *   Cloud access control: End users from
        Asia-Pacific had the highest proportion
        of ACaaS – all cloud access control use
        and consequently the lowest use of
        on-premises access control systems.
    *   Most positive story for 2024 project
        deployments: End users from Asia-
        Pacific reported the highest portion
        of 2024 projects which were not
        impacted by delays. Where there were
        reported delays, a lower percentage
        of end users stated this compared
        with the other regions. End users in
        Asia-Pacific also reported the highest
        percentage of projects that had been
        scaled up (over 20% compared to the
        global average of 14%).

---

### Europe

*   **Mature markets focusing on the replacement of
    aging systems, intrusion detection popular.**
    *   2025 replacement cycle: End users
        in Europe selected migration and
        replacement of legacy systems as their
        #1 focus for 2025. This choice was the
