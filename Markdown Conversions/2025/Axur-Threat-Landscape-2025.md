## Message from Axur

In 2025, cybersecurity experienced a clear paradox. We have more data, more visibility, and more tools than ever before, and yet we've never been so overwhelmed with alerts. The challenge is no longer knowing what's happening, but transforming information into action.

The landscape has changed. Supply chain attacks have become frequent, targeting the foundation: repositories, libraries, and solutions that support entire ecosystems. And increasingly, threat groups have exploited insiders, the internal vector used by malicious actors to compromise environments with precision and discretion.

It's in this context that Axur has been strengthening its mission to deliver structured, enriched, and prioritized data. The launch of Axur Command represents a step beyond, taking automation to the next level and allowing validation policies to be executed autonomously.

For 2026, our vision is clear. Data consolidation and the ability to act in an integrated manner will be the major differentiators. Axur wants to be, for the attack surface, what observability platforms are for engineering: a central nervous system. A single point where everything connects, prioritizes, and resolves.

This report presents our reading of the 2025 threat landscape, with trends, data, and practical perspectives for the coming year. We hope it helps security teams prioritize better, act faster, and, above all, anticipate risks before they become incidents.

Technology continues to advance, and with it come new possibilities. Our role is to ensure that this advancement happens with security, confidence, and responsibility.

Count on us in this journey.

Fábio Ramos
CEO, Axur.

## Cybersecurity Landscape

It's difficult to summarize the cybersecurity landscape in just a few threats or challenges. In a way, the challenge lies precisely in the diversity of threats and the volume of issues requiring attention.

In recent years, cybersecurity has become more sensitive to each business's needs, which contributes to risk management and project prioritization. In this sense, we cannot fail to mention that the business environment is also challenging, with regulatory and commercial uncertainties on a global scale that reverberate even to small and medium enterprises.

The technological environment has also changed. Some companies have been reducing the proportion of employees working remotely, but not even the end of remote work would end "remote data" stored in the cloud, with partners and third parties. But since this isn't always so evident, there's a risk that remote access security may be neglected.

At the same time, there's growing demand for interactive and intelligent services, whether in e-commerce or service provision. New engagement modalities also open opportunities for criminals.

All of this is happening without any truce in vulnerability exploitation or ransomware incidents.

On the contrary: vulnerabilities in network devices are increasingly concerning, and are now cited in ransomware attacks and data breaches. Meanwhile, social engineering scams are partially shifting from end users to IT professionals, reaching a new audience in unexpected ways.

### Edge Devices Become Priority Target

Attacks on edge devices (mainly VPNs and firewalls) stood out in 2024 and consolidated in 2025.

The exploitation of vulnerabilities was a concerning point in these attacks, but not the only one. Hackers also managed to carry out invasions using stolen credentials and even brute force attacks. Some of these attacks drew attention for bypassing two-factor authentication, either through the use of vulnerabilities or perhaps thanks to a leak of the one-time code generation keys.

The Vulnerability Catalog of the United States Cybersecurity Agency (CISA) indicates that devices and software from various manufacturers had their vulnerabilities exploited throughout the year. Broadcom, Cisco, Fortinet, Ivanti, Juniper, Palo Alto Networks, and SonicWall are some of the brands on the 2025 list.

The objective of exploiting these devices was quite varied.

Part of the attacks aimed to invade corporate networks to install ransomware and carry out the already well-known extortion fraud in which hackers demand a ransom to recover encrypted files or to not disclose information exfiltrated from compromised systems.

Another set of attacks was attributed to sponsored actors. In these attacks, targets were typically critical infrastructure operators, such as telecommunications companies, energy companies, or government entities.

In the case of attacks against home routers, invaders typically install malware to connect the compromised equipment to a botnet. The devices can then be used in DDoS attacks or to act as proxies for criminals, hiding the origin of other activities. At least some of the codes used are based on Mirai, an IoT malware first detected in 2016.

### Social Engineering Attacks Target Support and Recruitment Teams

It's been a few years since the Scattered Spider group's activities have been demonstrating the effectiveness of innovative approaches in cyberattacks, mainly using social engineering. This happened again in 2025, with invasions that began from illegitimate phone calls asking for help to reset passwords.

This contact strategy with IT support teams differs from what is most common in social engineering, which are direct attacks against users. In these new cases, fraudsters pose as users asking for help with their credentials and thereby manage to obtain a valid credential to access the company's network or some platform.

The most notorious attacks with this approach happened in the UK, where retail chains were impacted and announced significant losses resulting from the invasions.

Social engineering tactics associated with employment and recruitment also deserve attention. This scam can be carried out against both companies and candidates.

In the case of fraud against recruiters, it occurs especially in stages where the candidate has the opportunity to send some material to the company. When the recruiter opens the received file, they may end up compromising their system and possibly the company's network.

Frauds against candidates happen in a similar manner. Scammers send fake job offers, suggesting that the professional participate in the selection process. The support material for participating in the process will be contaminated with malware, and the consequences can even reach the corporate network if the professional is currently employed.

Interestingly, these frauds frequently involve IT jobs and professionals. It's quite likely that targets are handpicked to reach specific companies or projects. Projects associated with the cryptocurrency market, for example, tend to be heavily targeted by criminals.

#### Scattered Spider
- **Financially motivated cybercriminal collective active since 2022 (USA and UK).**
- **Main Tactics**: Social engineering (spear phishing, smishing, vishing), SIM swapping, MFA fatigue, and use of legitimate remote access tools (SupremoControl, AnyDesk, ConnectWise, Splashtop).
- **Malware Used**: BlackCat, Qilin, Akira, DragonForce; stealers like Racoon and Meduza.
- **Notable Targets**: MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, Snowflake, and major financial institutions.
- **Objective**: Data theft and extortion for financial gains.

**Expert Commentary**
> Although Scattered Spider became notable as an affiliate of groups like BlackCat/ALPHV and, later, DragonForce, the collective evolved in 2025 to develop its own ransomware, abandoning the intermediary role. CISA confirmed this transition in a recent alert, highlighting the increase in the group's operational sophistication.

### Triple Extortion Makes Ransomware More Difficult to Contain

Ransomware attacks continue to represent a significant threat to businesses, and nearly all recorded malicious activities end up having some involvement with these attacks.

The RaaS (ransomware as a service) model establishes a structure in which various "affiliates" are responsible for finding ways to install the malware within corporate networks. This way, the same ransomware can be associated with multiple attack strategies.

Phishing, supply chain attacks, credential abuse, recruitment of internal collaborators, vulnerabilities – all these tactics are used to invade IT infrastructure and initiate the ransomware scam.

A point of attention in the ransomware context concerns the extortion modalities at the incident's outcome. Traditionally, ransomware encrypts system files to paralyze business activities and then charges for the key capable of restoring data and recovering systems.

Given the frequency of these attacks, many companies have adopted robust recovery processes to restore systems from protected backups, which reduced the criminals' coercive power.

Scammers then responded with double and triple extortion tactics, in which the company is also threatened with the exposure of corporate data and DDoS attacks – situations for which the company may not be prepared or cannot even prevent.

More recently, criminals have also been resorting to extortion attempts based solely on the threat of exposing corporate data. Even though criminals dispense with blocking systems and files through encryption, all other characteristics of the scam follow the ransomware pattern.

**Expert Commentary**
> Double extortion is already consolidated and appears almost as mandatory in the current scenario. Additionally, there are growing extortions exclusively related to data leaks without necessarily having encryption.
>
> Dispensing with data encryption, criminals can attempt extortion even when it wasn't feasible to obtain write access to certain systems, or when they know files can be easily recovered (as in the case of cloud storage).
>
> The arguments during "negotiation" with companies have also been evolving in the same direction. Gangs exploit the fear of legal repercussions and reputation damage resulting from data leaks to convince the victim to make the payment, including the use of supposed "lawyers" who would be offering legal advice.

### Supply Chain Attacks Become Recurrent

#### Software Supply Chain Becomes Contamination Vector

Attacks against the supply chain have consolidated as a robust vector for cyberattacks. The best-known historical incidents are possibly that of retailer Target, which suffered a data breach from the access of an HVAC service provider in 2013, and that of SolarWinds, which had its software tampered with by an invader to implant backdoors in several clients.

In recent years, the notion of supply chain risks has been expanded in certain aspects. The use of standardized platforms and software as a service (SaaS) solutions has enabled a new category of mass attacks, with or without the use of specific vulnerabilities.

The cases of MOVEit Transfer (2023) and Cleo (2024) are examples of mass incidents involving some vulnerability in software. Meanwhile, the data theft attacks that exploited Snowflake (2024) and Salesforce (2025) services used stolen credentials and social engineering, respectively. These recurring campaigns show that the strategy of attacking suppliers and third parties has consolidated among attackers.

Attacks against third parties have always been possible, of course, but now they are intentional and strategic, including to obtain privileged information (such as credentials) or to have access to an easier path to invade the final target's network.

A subgroup of supply chain attacks are attacks on software development infrastructure, which typically boils down to "software supply chain." This definition can include cases like SolarWinds and other situations where software is directly tampered with, but there is an even more specific portion of attacks located exclusively in software development processes.

In these attacks, criminals create or modify packages in repositories like npm and PyPI, which are used by engineers in other software. With this, malicious behavior spreads to other projects, affecting corporate solutions that use these codes.

It's quite common for small improvised applications for IT administrative activities to use these repositories, so the existence of direct risk cannot be ruled out just because the company doesn't formally engage in software development.

In addition, there is considerable indirect risk if the company uses other software that depends on packages in these libraries or in software development support services that may be compromised.

Throughout 2025, several malicious packages were observed in npm and PyPI. Hackers created various fake packages and tampered with legitimate packages, which was possible after stealing the maintainers' credentials.

#### Salesloft Incident Shows How Supply Chain Amplifies Breach Reach

An incident that hit Salesloft and its clients in August 2025 exemplifies several of the attack strategies that compose the year's landscape. It was a supply chain attack that began with social engineering against IT staff to steal credentials.

The hackers attacked a company engineer, possibly with social engineering, to obtain a GitHub credential. This credential was used to access the cloud infrastructure, from where criminals extracted OAuth tokens associated with Drift, a Salesloft chatbot.

Drift needed these OAuth authorizations to link to clients' Salesforce CRM instances and access the data that would support the personalized experience provided by the chatbot. Since these OAuth tokens gave access to Salesloft clients' corporate data, several companies were compromised.

## 2025 in Numbers

### Credentials

The Axur platform detected 6 billion new unique credentials in 2025. It's important to note that, until last year, our report brought the total number of credentials detected. The change came through processes implemented to bring accurate verification of collected data, in line with what we commented about less noise and more relevant alerts.

With the increase of large data recompilations being disclosed as if they were a new leak, it's more important than ever to offer security teams curated alerts that avoid the rework of checking credentials frequently re-shared in cybercriminal groups and forums. Therefore, a unique credential counts as a login and password set shared only once.

This number shows that there are still many malicious activities aimed at stealing credentials. These compromised credentials circulate in the criminal underworld spaces, fueling various threats and scams.

A point of attention is that the majority of new credentials (52.2%) are tied to corporate systems.

It's possible that these credentials grant access to systems that store commercial or personal information whose exposure would harm the company's activities or reputation. In several countries, the leak of personal data also generates legal consequences.

A recurring example in 2025 was attacks that used credentials from VPNs and other network edge devices.

Although MFA adoption reduces risks from leaked credentials, criminals have managed to combine these credentials with phishing scams, convincing a support analyst to disable or reconfigure MFA. Since the password is already in the criminals' hands, this is sufficient to compromise the account.

Credential leakage also increases the risk associated with vulnerabilities that allow bypassing MFA.

For these reasons, monitoring leaked credentials is an important mechanism to increase the resilience of authentication processes across all corporate systems, even if an MFA solution is in use.

### Phishing

Axur detected 71,399 phishing pages in 2025.

Phishing is one of the best-known and most constant cyber frauds. At Axur, we count the web pages where phishing occurs, regardless of the channel used to deliver these pages to victims. Thus, in addition to links to fake sites disclosed in emails, Smishing pages (phishing by SMS) and sites promoted by paid ads are also counted.

After a significant increase in phishing page detection in the previous year, the total volume of pages remained stable in 2025.

Phishing detection can be combined with the takedown process to remove the fraud from the air, decreasing the impact on the brand and consumers. With the use of Clair (Cyber Lens for Anomaly and Impersonation Recognition), our artificial intelligence model, it's possible to identify phishing pages reliably and automatically.

Additionally, the attributes identified by Clair become filters that allow detection beyond keywords.
- 70% of phishing scams don't use a keyword in the domain
- 18% don't bring the keyword in the page's HTML code

Phishing cases that use brand colors, for example, are found by automated monitoring and subject to automatic takedown. Additionally, it's possible to use Threat Hunting to search for URLs with varied attributes.

**Possible Searches:**
- **Brand imitation by visual elements**: identifies sites that imitate well-known brands or display specific logos. For example, detect varying levels of "BrandName" imitation or find sites displaying the "BrandLogo".
- **Content type and sensitive data requests**: phishing sites by content type, such as login pages, error pages, or e-commerce sites. It's also possible to identify those requesting sensitive information, such as passwords or payment data.
- **Domain analysis and lifecycle**: examines based on creation or expiration dates, or filter results by recent detection dates to find new threats.
- **References and URL attributes**: specific URLs or references and filters by domain, subdomain, or top-level domain (TLD) attributes to refine searches.
- **HTML content**: searches for specific terms present in detected pages' code, such as emails, phone numbers, and more.
- **Language and region-specific threats**: identify more localized phishing campaigns.

#### Division by Sector

Analyzing the volume of phishing pages by sector of the brand used in the scam, we observed an increase in the proportion of attacks aimed at banks and financial institutions. In the previous year, retail had a comfortable margin at the top of the list, but this was not the case in 2025.

It's worth remembering that scams using retail brands can easily adopt narratives to steal credit cards and other financial data. Therefore, a difference in the type of brand used doesn't in itself characterize a change in criminals' interests.

The 2025 data indicates a relevant shift in the focus of phishing campaigns. The Financial/Insurance sector recorded a 65% increase in detections, surpassing Retail/E-commerce. This movement suggests that threat actors are redirecting efforts toward financial institutions, attracted by the potential for direct gain.

The Transportation sector also showed growth. These frauds exploit the delivery tracking ecosystem and the use of fake carrier pages, expanding the attack surface against consumers and companies in the sector.

**Evolution of Sectors Most Targeted by Phishing**
*Between 2024 and 2025*

| Sector             | 2024   | 2025   | Change   |
|--------------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Retail/E-Commerce  | 27,305 | 21,558 | ↓ -21%   |
| Banks/Financial    | 18,915 | 24,959 | ↑ +65%   |
| Technology         | 9,502  | 7,752  | ↓ -18%   |
| Food/Beverages     | 3,462  | 5,431  | ↑ +56%   |
| Transportation     | 3,330  | 3,359  | ↑ +0.87% |

#### Phishing Trends: Evolution by Sector

In the sector breakdown, a relevant change is observed in the distribution of phishing incidents. The financial/insurance segment took the lead in attack volume, surpassing retail and e-commerce, which had occupied the first position in the previous year. This reversal may be related to the increase in exploitation of corporate credentials and the use of SaaS integrations as an initial access vector. The transport and logistics sectors showed occasional fluctuations, while food and beverages maintained relative stability, with smaller volumes.

*Distribution of phishing incidents by economic sector between 2024 and 2025.*

#### Phishing Trends: Evolution by Attack Vector

Attack vectors showed considerable variation throughout the year. The more traditional campaigns, grouped under the "other" category, which includes fake pages and cloned sites, remained predominant but exhibited irregular behavior with peaks concentrated in the first quarter. Among specific channels, social media ads maintained a consistent presence, while paid search remained at low levels, though they continue to be employed in short-range campaigns targeting specific audiences. SMS-based attacks showed gradual growth.

The diversification of targets and expansion of fraud channels suggest that attackers are distributing their efforts across sectors and platforms to maximize campaign impact.

This landscape reinforces the need for broader monitoring and threat correlation approaches capable of encompassing the digital exposure ecosystem as a whole.

*Monthly evolution of the main attack vectors observed between late 2024 and 2025.*

### AI Accelerates Phishing: Fake Pages Created in Minutes with Tools like Lovable

Digital fraud groups have incorporated AI-assisted generation tools like Lovable to automate the creation of phishing pages with high visual fidelity. These builders allow them to replicate legitimate interfaces, banks, e-commerce providers, authentication services, in a matter of minutes, without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

The use of generative models to clone login flows, adjust persuasive text, and adapt language to the target accelerates the production and customization of campaigns, reducing the time between conception and execution. This trend consolidates phishing as a highly scalable and difficult-to-detect attack vector, especially when combined with kits hosted on legitimate infrastructure and newly registered domains.

![Screenshot from Axur's Threat Hunting shows phishing cases created with the Lovable tool.]

### Top-Level Domain Usage

The list of top-level domains (TLDs) most used by criminals remained very similar to the previous year. The rising share of .app clearly shows how AI-powered website builders have become a go-to resource for criminals creating fraudulent pages. Netlify, Vercel, and Lovable account for 75% of phishing cases using the .app TLD.

**Top TLDs most used between late 2024 and 2025**

| TLD       | 2024    | 2025    | Change     |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------|
| .com      | 26,612  | 20,921  | ↓ -21.4%   |
| .online   | 9,147   | 4,861   | ↓ -46.9%   |
| .site     | 5,062   | 6,392   | ↑ +26.3%   |
| .shop     | 5,196   | 6,358   | ↑ +22.4%   |
| .com.br   | 3,644   | 4,275   | ↑ +17.3%   |
| .store    | 1,721   | 1,607   | ↓ -6.6%    |
| .net      | 1,489   | 922     | ↓ -38.1%   |
| .org      | 1,254   | 861     | ↓ -31.3%   |
| .ru       | 1,017   | 552     | ↓ -45.7%   |
| .de       | 928     | 895     | ↓ -3.6%    |
| .xyz      | 997     | 494     | ↓ -50.5%   |
| .app      | -       | 1619    | New        |
| .top      | -       | 952     | New        |

TLDs are the suffixes of web addresses, such as ".com" (which can be used by any person or organization), ".gov" (exclusive to United States government sites), and ".uk" (country suffix).

Since short addresses, simple words, and trademarks are no longer available in traditional TLDs, criminals may try to find these addresses in newer generic TLDs or similar alternatives.

TLD granting was quite restricted in the past, as only a few institutions were authorized to operate them, typically to represent regions or countries (such as ".br", ".de", ".jp," ".ar", among others).

Since 2012, there has been a procedure to apply for a generic top-level domain (gTLD) concession, making the creation of new suffixes more flexible. Each TLD is operated by a registry, which can choose to sell subdomains to recover the infrastructure and application costs.

Since the procedure to apply for a gTLD is expensive and quite bureaucratic, cybercriminals need to choose from existing TLDs to register a domain that serves to expand the reach of a fraud or make it more convincing.

This choice is especially important for phishing sites, as the page address will likely be checked by victims. To make this choice, the scammer typically considers several elements:

- **Domain availability**:
- **Link to the fraud**: Some gTLD suffixes are thematic. A criminal may understand that some of them will make the fraud more convincing. This is one of the factors that may explain the increase in the use of the ".app" TLD, for example.
- **Cost**: Some TLDs are more expensive than others. In cases like ".edu" and ".gov", which cannot be registered, the cybercriminal's only option is to compromise a site with these suffixes to host the fraud.
- **Registrar policies and fraud prevention**: There are rules that all domain registrars must follow. However, there may be differences in handling specific cases that motivate a preference on the part of criminals, as this affects how long the fraud can remain active.

### Cards

The Axur Platform detected the breach of data from 395 million credit and debit cards.

The number of detected leaked cards in 2025 remained stable compared to the previous report period. Unfortunately, the number of leaked cards is still significant and concerning.

Thanks to the BIN (Bank Identification Number), it's possible to identify the origin of each card.

**Top 10 Countries with Most Valid Cards Exposed**
United States: 56.16% | Brazil: 5.36% | UK: 2.24% | Australia: 1.73% | India: 1.67% | Thailand: 1.32% | Turkey: 0.74% | Spain: 0.71% | Israel: 0.68% | Others: 6.49%

In 2025, the United States continues to lead globally in leaked cards, followed by Brazil and UK. Card theft represents a significant risk for financial institutions and e-commerce. After a card is used fraudulently, the consumer typically initiates a chargeback process, forcing the store to refund the charged amount. Since the merchandise cannot always be recovered, the store will suffer a loss from this transaction. With Axur's data, retailers can detect the use of leaked cards and block the purchase or perform the necessary validations to ensure its legitimacy.

Verification is also especially important for payment institutions. Card exposures directly impact financial institutions and processors that need to validate transactions quickly and accurately to reduce losses and maintain trust with card networks.

**Real Use Case**
**150% less time in card validation**
In 2025, fintech company Zoop, which provides technological infrastructure for the financial sector, integrated Axur's exposed cards database into its validation process. The verification occurs in milliseconds and preventively blocks about 30% of transaction attempts with compromised cards, reducing operational response time by 150% and strengthening payment operations security.

## Deep & Dark Web

In 2025, we found 496,403 suspicious communications on the Deep & Dark Web that were converted into incidents for investigation and intelligence gathering.

The cybercrime ecosystem has a series of channels that typically remain outside the visible web for most people, as they don't appear in simple search engine queries, and entry to these channels, groups, or forums is often restricted.

However, these Deep & Dark Web spaces used by criminals can be monitored to generate intelligence about the cyber threats being discussed in these locations.

*Sources of incidents on the deep and dark web in 2025.*

### Most Affected Sectors on the Deep & Dark Web

The financial sector took the lead, rising from 26.1% to 48.6% of occurrences, while retail dropped from 45% to 18.1%. This reversal reflects the growth of fraud targeting the banking and payment methods ecosystem.

The increase also suggests greater sophistication in criminal group strategies, which are exploiting more structural vulnerabilities with greater force, such as system integrations and access credentials at financial institutions.

The advance of the technology sector, from 16.8% to 22.5%, also reinforces this movement: infrastructure providers, fintechs, and SaaS platforms have come to occupy a central role in the risk chain. Meanwhile, telecommunications maintained stability with a slight reduction, which may indicate greater maturity of controls and more agile incident response.

Together, the data confirm a trend of fraud campaign migration toward targets with greater systemic impact, where the exploitation of credentials, APIs, and integrations can generate cascading effects across multiple financial services.

*Distribution of takedowns by sector between late 2024 and 2025.*

| Sector             | 2024  | 2025  | Change |
|--------------------|-------|-------|--------|
| Retail/E-commerce  | 45%   | 18.1% | ↓ -59% |
| Financial/Insurance| 26.1% | 48.6% | ↑ +86% |
| Technology         | 16.8% | 22.5% | ↑ +33% |
| Telecommunications | 4.8%  | 4.7%  | ↓ -2%  |

Axur has visibility into several of these channels and conducts monitoring that transforms collected signals into incidents that can be investigated. In some situations, these signals even allow blocking an action before it actually occurs.

**Real Use Case**
**Insider Detection from Dark Web Evidence**
In 2025, Grupo Casas Bahia used Axur's deep & dark web monitoring to investigate evidence of corporate information leakage identified in restricted forums. Based on these signals, the cybersecurity team conducted an in-depth analysis that revealed the operation of insiders involved in extracting and commercializing internal data.

The investigation made it possible to map the leak's origin, contain the responsible group, and implement preventive controls to avoid recurrences and mitigate any reputational impact.

## Fake Profiles, Illegitimate Apps, and Fraudulent Brand Usage

No fraud reaches victims by identifying itself as fraud. Instead, they use known brands and people, preferably in plausible scenarios, so that victims believe the scam narrative.

Axur's monitoring scans the web to detect situations where a brand is used improperly to promote illegitimate content and offers, malicious apps, fraudulent profiles, and unauthorized brand use in sponsored search links.

In 2025, incidents of improper brand use registered an increase, with indications that practices related to typosquatting, cybersquatting, or similar domain registration (+1000%), and brand use in paid ads contributed to this movement.

Fraudulent brand use remains the most common incident, followed by fake social media profiles and fake apps.

Fake social media profiles can be used to deceive consumers with offers or services that don't exist. The consumer may believe they're talking to a genuine company representative and purchase products or services that will never be delivered, creating an undesirable situation for the company, which lost a customer, and the consumer themselves, who lost their money.

Brand use in paid search also increased, from 1,282 to 5,499 records, which corroborates the trend observed by Axur researchers that scammers have increasingly sought to use online advertising to give an appearance of legitimacy to frauds.

Fake apps for mobile devices are a serious threat especially for financial sector companies, as these apps can use the brand of banks and financial institutions to request victims' data and credentials.

In 2025, fake mobile apps appear to show a significant decline. However, as we showed in the TLD analysis, this movement may be related to a tactical migration by threat actors, who began to exploit URLs hosted on .app domains more intensively.

## Executives and VIPs

We detected over 19 thousand incidents involving the image and information of Executives & VIPs.

Criminals can take advantage of the image and information of executives and other well-known personalities in various scenarios.

Executive data can fuel Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, in which the scammer sends fake emails to other company employees or business partners. If the recipients believe the message, they may follow dangerous instructions and even conduct improper financial transactions.

This personal information can also be used to craft frauds against the executives themselves, creating a risk for the organization and its internal systems.

We detected about 2000 incidents involving the exposure of credentials from executives or senior management at companies.

Meanwhile, executives' images in fake profiles and social media content can be used to increase the credibility of some product or service. On this issue, we have observed a regionalization of frauds involving the endorsement of investment opportunities, using the image of well-known executives in the country, such as Elon Musk.

The improvement of artificial intelligence tools has facilitated the creation of convincing deepfakes, whether in static images or videos. As a result, many people may have difficulty identifying that the content is fake. In certain incidents, the fake content may only be in the photo caption, distorting the image's context to mislead the victim.
