## Key takeaways

- The frequency of reported cyber incidents grew — up 22% on the previous year.
- Ransomware claims frequency increased while the average ransom payment amount for Aon broking clients declined by 77%.
- Midsized organizations filed more cyber claims than any other group, over half of all incidents.

The past year’s cyber attacks and technology outages illustrated the compounding risk from growing technology interdependencies. Major systemic-type events shook the scene in 2024, particularly evident in attacks against information technology (IT) service providers. A notable February attack on a healthcare payments technology provider resulted from the failure to implement multi-factor authorization, an industry standard and mandatory for baseline cyber-readiness. The ransomware breach affected the private data of approximately 190 million individuals. It led to a backlog of unpaid claims that left doctors’ offices and hospitals with severe cashflow problems and threatened patients’ access to care. The direct financial impact on the company was likewise extreme, tallying $3.09 billion pre-tax.

In July, the Crowdstrike outage served as a timely warning of the high risks associated with digital interconnectedness. The outage caused more than 8.5 million systems to crash, disrupting operations worldwide and impacting commercial flights, hospitals, and financial services. One airline industry victim reported a $500 million revenue and $170 million expense impact. Wrapping up the year, a ransomware attack on a U.S. supply chain management provider was felt around the world. This hosting environment disruption affected major organizations, including retailers and software and IT service providers.

## Cyber Claims Rise. Payouts Decline

As cyber attacks persisted, the frequency of cyber claims grew across 2024, ranging from ransomware and business interruption to class action litigation and regulatory investigations — resulting in an increasingly complex incident response. In the U.S., for example, Aon Cyber and Errors and Omissions (E&O) claims data revealed 1,228 reported incidents across broking clients in 2024, reflecting an increase of 22 percent year over year. Cyber events or litigation represented most claims, with 776 reported matters in the U.S. — up a third on the previous year — and 320 reported matters in EMEA.

This increase was driven by a rise in cyber incidents, more organizations acquiring cyber insurance and a heightened regulatory focus on publicly disclosing material events. Aon analysts observed underinsurance and a lack of basic cyber readiness plans exposed mid-market organizations to significant risk. Midsized organizations with $100 million to $2 billion annual revenue filed more claims than any other group, representing 52 percent of all matters.

Response plans enable organizations to reduce the cost of a breach by an average of almost $500,000, providing reassurance about the effectiveness of these strategies.

Though the frequency of claims grew, claim ratio experience from a leading cyber insurer remained mostly static and even improved in 2024, decreasing by nearly 3 percent compared to 2023. Despite pressure on premium rates, it was observed that Aon clients who invested in cyber preparedness were better able to respond to attacks with the technology controls and continuity plans to restore systems or regain access to data. IBM research found that having an incident response team and formal incident response plans enables organizations to reduce the cost of a breach by an average of almost $500,000, providing reassurance about the effectiveness of these strategies.

## Ransomware Persists

Ransomware incidents persisted in 2024, increasing 24 percent versus 2023. Fraud and social engineering remained flat while claims frequency for privacy and data breaches and lost, missing, or stolen data decreased.

### Cyber Frequency Trend | Global Data*
![Image description]
* Global dataset with a strong U.S. emphasis

Despite the increased frequency of incidents, ransomware payment severity for Aon broking clients declined, likely supported by stronger cyber security controls. The average reported payment amounts also dropped by 77 percent, helping to maintain a soft market.

This Aon client data aligns with Coveware’s 2024 quarterly report which shows that despite increased ransomware activity, fewer companies are paying. The percentage of companies paying ransom dropped to an all-time low of 25 percent, marking a significant milestone in the fight against ransomware. While the average ransomware payment trended up in 2024, cresting at $553,959 in the fourth quarter of 2024, or an increase of 16 percent over the prior quarter. Meanwhile, median payments, which are typically a more reliable indicator of where the market is heading, are declining. The median ransom payment was $110,890 in fourth quarter 2024, a decline of 45 percent from the previous three months.

10

Global organizations such as the Ransomware Task Force, continue to identify ransomware threat actors and protect organizations. While successful, recent law enforcement actions to dismantle ransomware threat actor groups destabilized the space, giving rise to dozens of splinter groups.

Ransomware payment bans are back on the table as governments contemplate minimizing payments and compelling cybercriminals to cease attacking their countries’ organizations.

According to Aon’s data, E&O Cyber Broking reported incidents trended up in 2024 with 1,228 events or an increase of 22 percent. As for observed ransomware breaches (ORBs), or instances of organizations named and/or having their data published on ransomware leak sites due to not paying, the U.S. dominated the charts with more than 50 percent of incidents. Consumer and industrial products, professional services and consulting and manufacturing were the top three targeted sectors, with the real estate industry running close behind, claiming 13 percent of total victims.

Access claims trended up and down across the year. Access claims arise when threat actors, known as initial access brokers, breach organizations’ networks and sell this unauthorized access to other threat actors, leading to ransomware attacks and malicious activities. Targeting Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tools was the method of attack for half of all access claims.

Based on Aon’s proprietary data, threat actors continue to favor remote access and other administrator tools over malware. Identifying non-standard applications remains a key challenge for victims, and threat actors use ORBs more frequently to keep attacks hidden. With perimeter devices such as firewalls and VPNs as the most common entry point for attackers, IT teams must be vigilant about patching, MFA, and cert-based authentication.

## The Return on Security Investment

Entering 2025, we expect to see more organizations better able to manage their cyber risk. Insureds continue to use data modeling to help make better decisions and inform cyber purchasing decisions to determine the appropriate limit levels. Aon saw 21 percent of clients purchase additional limits in 2024 and we anticipate further increases in demand for cyber insurance and technology E&O insurance. Competitive market conditions in excess layers coupled with rate decreases across the tower in both the primary and excess layers helped to drive this increase in additional limits. However, organizations are constantly evaluating cyber risk. Risk analysis allows organizations to make better-informed decisions around their insurance risk transfer program, whether through higher limits, different program structures, or alternative risk transfer solutions.

## Key takeaways

- After ten straight quarters of pricing decreases, cyber insurance pricing is still decreasing, ending with a 7% decline in Q1 2025. Broader coverage and increased limits are now available in most markets for risks with responsive cyber security controls.
- Despite increased claims frequency, the average payment dropped by 77%. Insurers demonstrated remarkable resilience and loss ratios remained stable, serving as a testament to the stability of the market.
- Systemic and third-party risks remain under-managed and deserve focus in 2025. Organizations are encouraged to model the total cyber risk exposure of large-scale systemic events.

Significant, systemic events dominated 2024 with Aon’s Cyber Solutions U.S. data revealing 1,228 reported incidents across Aon’s Cyber Solutions clients — an increase of 22 percent. Cyber incidents or litigation represented most claims, with 776 reported incidents — up 31 percent.

Despite increased claims frequency in 2024, insurer loss ratios were not materially impacted, and buyers’ market conditions continued through 2024 for cyber amid a well-capitalized and competitive environment. Favorable conditions are expected to continue in 2025, supporting growth in emerging cyber markets; however, the juxtaposition of loss trends and a softening market could mean future market volatility. Risk differentiation remains key to favorable renewal outcomes over the long term.”

On average, buyers achieved a 7 percent premium decrease in Q1 2025, primarily driven by ample capacity, the introduction of new capacity and incumbent insurers being aggressive with renewal terms to maintain their incumbent renewals.

Despite this difference in activity, it’s still unclear how many of these ransomware incidents are claims with insurance recoveries, versus falling within the self-insured retention (SIR).

2

The cyber retail and reinsurance markets demonstrated solid margins, supporting the view that the global cyber insurance industry is stable despite growing competition and the increasing sophistication, severity and frequency of cyber incidents. Stronger competition has also resulted in lower self-insured retentions, premiums, an easing of required sub-limits and coverage enhancements for policyholders.

In 2025, we expect pricing to continue to moderate, with more favorable conditions across an increasingly wider range of risks and geographies. Ample capacity and aggressive competition continue to drive a buyers’ market for cyber despite an increase in ransomware activity in prior years. In most markets, moderate rate reductions, broader coverage and increased limits are available for risks with responsive cyber security controls.

Looking to the reinsurance market in 2025, supply of capital from traditional sources remains abundant relative to current demand, with alternative capacity, such as insurance-linked securities and catastrophe bonds increasing in availability through innovative risk transfer structures. This supply-demand imbalance led to a favorable January renewal cycle for buyers of cyber reinsurance.

The suite of reinsurance products and structures will continue to evolve and expand as cyber insurers seek new, more effective, ways to optimize their net position according to their risk appetite.

This is a strong indicator that buyer-friendly market conditions, which include slightly lower premiums, broader coverage and more flexible terms, can be expected into the first half of 2025 for cyber insurance purchasers.

## Cyber Insurance Steers Risk Mitigation

Cyber-attacks pose a growing balance sheet threat, with three-quarters of completed attacks leading to financial losses. Adoption of cyber insurance is widespread and is a board-level consideration. It is reported that 90 percent of organizations with 500 to 1,000 employees have some form of cyber coverage, 50 percent have a standalone policy while 40 percent have cyber as part of a wider business insurance policy , and 25 percent of Aon clients purchased additional limits in 2024. Stricter underwriting by insurers demands that organizations invest in cyber preparedness to help secure a policy. This investment in readiness can benefit both insurers and insureds. Aon clients that invested in cyber preparedness in 2024 were better positioned to respond to attacks with technology controls and continuity plans in place to restore systems or regain access to data. Despite increased claims frequency across 2024, the average payment dropped by 77 percent. This paradox — rising claims but declining payments — helped to maintain the soft market.

### Ransomware Severity (in $)
![Image description]
Average Demand Amount
Average Payment Amount

## Key Observations:

- In 2024, the average payment amount declined 77%, and the number of ransomware incidents remained flat, compared to the same period in 2023. Despite frequency increasing year over- year, the severity has declined supported by stronger cyber security controls, so we’ve remained in a soft market.
- Despite a decrease in severity, the increase in frequency necessitates guidance around reporting and navigating notices.
- Large-scale systemic events took center stage in 2024, as evidenced by the CrowdStrike outage that disrupted operations worldwide and impacted commercial flights, hospitals, and financial services. Technology interconnectedness is growing, coupled with increased regulatory scrutiny on how organizations manage their systemic risks. In this uncertain operating environment, organizations should model their total cyber risk exposure through the financial quantification of relevant cyber scenarios and insurers need this high level of modeling to write or renew policies. Although the ransomware breach of a major healthcare payments technology provider in 2024 did not impact the cyber insurance industry directly, it caused associated and downstream losses for organizations that depended on that vendor. Aon is on the frontline in this trend, using more sophisticated models and tools that enable data-driven scenario analysis with its Cyber Risk Analyzer.

7

It is expected that insurers will employ more robust modeling to help protect their portfolios against loss and close knowledge gaps around systemic and third-party risk. By leveraging quantitative modeling and underwriting, they can help improve decision-making to safeguard shareholder equity and help protect customers, employees and the public. This increased focus on advanced risk-selection technologies and claims management, including incident response (IR) and even specialized ransomware response teams, is also helping to make the cyber insurance industry more sustainable and propelling its development.

8

## Actions for Organizations

- **Use Decision Analytics.** Cyber events can affect all areas of an organization, and regulatory bodies as well as shareholders are expecting a tighter focus on this risk. Aon’s Cyber Risk Analyzer provides brokers and clients access to loss forecasting, exposure assessment and total cost of risk (TCOR), driving stakeholder alignment across the C-suite and enabling businesses to optimize their cyber-insurance programs relative to their unhedged loss potential.
- **Strengthen Cyber Security Posture.** Systemic and third-party risks remain undermanaged and deserve focus in 2025. A privacy data breach, unauthorized access or disclosure of personal information, or loss of personal information can also have serious consequences. While a well-known topic, multi-factor authentication is still an underwriting requirement, as is a tested IR plan.
- **Be Strategic In-Market.** Given the buyer-friendly market conditions, we advocate for insurers to offer expanded coverage to meet evolving risks. Organizations require broader coverage that addresses business and dependent business interruption, supply chain vulnerability, regulatory exposure inclusive of wrongful data collection events, and coverage for AI creation or usage-related events.

# Raising a Red Flag: Cyber Risk Controls and Insurability

(cid:0)

(cid:0)

(cid:0)

(cid:0)

## Key takeaways

- Aon clients who invested in security controls reported a significant 9% improvement in critical — or ‘red flag’ — controls. This may impact insurability.
- Cyber insurance carriers moved towards a more holistic view of cyber risk resilience.
- Prioritization of controls and red flags continued to change in 2024, with privacy-oriented, third-party and supply chain controls emerging as new areas of interest for insurance.

Security measures and frameworks continue to be mission-critical in the battle against cyber threats, and organizations across sectors continued to invest in and improve their critical controls over the course of 2024.

At the same time, insurance carriers have become more sophisticated in risk underwriting, requesting less information than before. Where insurers might have looked at a weak control a few years ago and taken a firm position, this was no longer the case. As opposed to the long-established approach, if you have control “X,” then the result “Y” ensues, carriers became more focused on the overall cyber maturity profile and proved more receptive to accepting an organization’s narrative around specific controls. This approach rang true with larger, more mature organizations, as many insurers accepted updates on security road maps and confirmation that controls were in place without scrutinizing evidence that controls were tested and effective. This new climate that emerged in 2024 was driven in part by intense global cyber insurance market competition and is expected to continue into 2025.

## Privacy-Oriented Controls. A Growing Priority

Despite overall cyber security improvements, significant breaches persisted across 2024, exploiting vulnerabilities such as weak MFA controls and third-party diligence. As risks dynamically change and threat actors shift their tactics, controls remain a moving target. The prioritization of different security controls continues to evolve, making organizations often uncertain about where to focus security investment. A data analysis of security controls to risk can help illuminate potential exposure to loss.

Privacy-oriented controls emerged as a focus for insurance carriers in 2024. This shift is in response to the increasing legal scrutiny of how insured entities handle personal information. This scrutiny was particularly noticeable in the U.S., where data breaches have led to multi-plaintiff or class action lawsuits. These lawsuits piled up in 2024 in response to numerous healthcare breaches alleging violation of patient privacy rights, including sharing data with third parties. As new technologies such as AI emerge, class action lawsuits are evolving. Companies are also facing a new cyber threat based on “pixels,” code embedded in webpages or mobile apps from third-party providers to collect information about a user’s interaction.

Regulatory shifts also play a significant role in shaping the focus on privacy. More states across the U.S. are working to pass laws and regulations that emulate both the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) — which protects consumers’ data privacy and security, including from cyber attacks, fraud and mistakes — and the European Union’s Digital Operational Resilience Act, which requires financial institutions to incorporate data protection and privacy risks into their overall Information and Communication Technology risk assessments.

## Recommended Actions

- Work with your cyber insurance broker to review controls and claim sources. Control improvement helps to reduce claim frequency and severity and helps build cyber risk resilience.
- Conduct a data-driven analysis of your organization’s cyber risk posture to inform decision-making about security investments.
- Understand controls from both a risk and an insurability perspective.
- Develop an action plan to address critical risks that could increase your organization’s likelihood of being attacked. Importantly, build resilience in privacy and third-party cyber security.
