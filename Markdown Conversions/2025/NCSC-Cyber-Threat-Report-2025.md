## Foreword
### Whakapuakitanga

Are you prepared for a serious cyber security incident?

If your organisation was targeted by a sophisticated actor today, would you be ready?

New Zealand’s remote location at the bottom of the world can isolate us from challenges in other regions, but when it comes to cyber activity, there’s nowhere to hide.

Over recent years, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has dealt with about one incident per day that has the potential to cause harm at the national level. Such incidents don’t just involve large corporates or big government agencies – some smaller organisations also play a crucial role in our economy and society and can be affected.

Many New Zealand businesses and organisations make the mistake of assuming they are not big enough, wealthy enough or critical enough to be a target.

As we highlight in this report, there are many reasons why your organisation may be a target.

In cyber security, we talk about the activity of threat actors arising from their capability and intent. Do they have the tools and ability to cause us harm? Do they have a reason to? Around the globe, both capability and intent are on the rise.

Capability is increasing through technological advancement. Business models such as ransomware-as-a-service – in which developers sell or rent ransomware tools and infrastructure to other cybercriminals – are well-established and have enabled a less technically skilled cohort of malicious actors to access effective tools.

In terms of intent, malicious cyber actors target New Zealand organisations for a range of reasons. Financial gain is the obvious one, but actors may also be motivated by espionage (including intellectual property theft), or the desire to cause disruption for political reasons. The current turbulent international environment is more likely to generate motivated actors.

The likelihood of threats being realised also depends on target availability and how well-defended those targets are. Malicious actors’ scope for causing harm has been enlarged as the threat surface has also expanded. New systems, technologies and practices that organisations are adopting can open new avenues for attack.

And although you may be doing your best as an organisation to keep your own security practices up to standard, you may be affected by a supplier or third party with links to your network or in custody of your data.

In summary, malicious actors could target you because of what you have, what you know, or what you stand for. You may be a stepping stone to another, more valuable organisation. You may be collateral damage. Or you might just be an easy win.

HOW PREPARED ARE YOU?

While cyber security is an important focus of the Government, most protections in New Zealand exist outside government. Individuals, private organisations, and industry are best-placed to protect data, networked devices, and infrastructure, and most effort in protecting technology and systems needs to come from the owners and operators of these.

This report is designed for leaders making strategic decisions about cyber security risks and investments in medium-to-large organisations in both the public and private sectors. However, the report has relevance for anyone seeking to protect themselves or their organisation from cyber risks. By being equipped with the right context and questions to ask, you can ensure your organisation is thinking about the risks that may affect you. Those who have read our previous Cyber Threat Reports may notice that the format has changed this year. We hope you find value in our new approach.

## Key judgements for 2025
### Ngā whakataunga matua mō te tau 2025

Cyber security is a critically important consideration for all New Zealand organisations.

In this document we set out five judgements for 2025 regarding cyber security. Each judgement explores a key aspect of the current threat landscape that we think is most relevant for decision-makers.

The judgements are:

1.  State-sponsored actors are actively targeting New Zealand
2.  The commercialisation of cybercrime means cybercriminals have more tools
3.  Hacktivists are targeting New Zealand organisations as global conflicts escalate
4.  Threat actors are exploiting supply chains, hidden dependencies and organisational blind spots to cause impact
5.  Known weaknesses and unpatched vulnerabilities are providing threat actors with easy access

These are explored further in the following sections.

Our judgements are based on our work both domestically and internationally. This is not an exhaustive list, but they include some of the most prominent, noteworthy and recurrent issues that we observe.

These judgements also reflect the trends in the more severe incidents the NCSC responded to this year. Of the 5995 reports received by the NCSC during the 2024/25 financial year, 331 incidents were triaged as incidents of potential national significance, meaning they received additional analysis and support.

The statistics and case studies used throughout the report are primarily based on our work between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025. We recognise that we do not have perfect understanding of the cyber security environment, so these should be regarded as illustrative rather than a complete overview.

This report will give you a picture of how the cyber security environment is evolving and how these changes should be factored into your risk assessments and strategic thinking.

We hope this information will help you consider how well your organisation is prepared for the current cyber threat landscape, and will help to inform the cyber security investment and resourcing decisions you make in your organisation. This information should be considered alongside other sources of information that inform your cyber security decisions.

## JUDGEMENT 1 | WHAKATAUNGA 1

### State-sponsored actors are actively targeting New Zealand
### Kei te poke tonu ngā mūrere a kāwanatanga kē i a Aotearoa

State-sponsored actors are among the most sophisticated and persistent threats in cyberspace. They are generally motivated not by financial gain but by national objectives such as gaining strategic advantage.

They may attempt to achieve these objectives through intellectual property theft, espionage, disruption of critical services, and even sabotage.

Globally, there is growing concern and increased awareness of state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, particularly against government organisations, critical infrastructure and sensitive industries.

#### Tactics and techniques

State-sponsored actors often use techniques such as spear-phishing, zero-day exploitation, and living off the land to blend into legitimate activity on a computer system or network. They may also make use of ephemeral or disposable infrastructure, like botnets. These actors are often referred to as advanced persistent threats (APTs) due to their resourcing and ability to switch between tactics and techniques to achieve and maintain access to their targets.

Spear-phishing sees actors take the time to research victims, to create a customised and convincing message from what appears to be a trusted source. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools make this job much easier and faster. (Read more on the impact of AI on page 15)

#### EXAMPLES

*   In September 2024, US authorities warned that cyber actors affiliated with the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) were responsible for attacks designed to cause espionage, sabotage and reputational harm. (https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-249a)
*   Between October 2023 and October 2024, suspected Iranian cyber actors were discovered conducting credential brute-forcing in attempts to access operational technology across the government, information technology, engineering, and energy sectors. (https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-290a)

A zero-day exploitation is a vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor and does not have an available patch. State-sponsored actors are known to utilise zero-day vulnerabilities, often against cyber-mature organisations. The lack of an available security update to address the vulnerability means that malicious cyber actors have more time to compromise computer networks without detection and maintain their unauthorised access.

Living off the land involves the use of legitimate or pre-existing software on a victim network to maintain access. This is less likely to raise alerts for defenders, compared to the installation of malicious software, which may look suspicious in incident response logs and is much more likely to be stopped by antivirus software.

Living off the land techniques have been employed by two prominent threat actor groups referred to as Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon.

*   ‘Salt Typhoon’ activity has been described by our US partner agency, CISA, as a ‘broad and significant cyber espionage campaign targeting commercial telecommunications infrastructure’. Salt Typhoon, has been observed in several countries, including New Zealand. New Zealand operates similar systems to partner nations meaning New Zealand organisations need to be aware of this activity and how to defend against it.
*   ‘Volt Typhoon’ is a PRC state-sponsored actor that has been observed compromising the digital systems of critical infrastructure providers in the United States. The US assesses that Volt Typhoon has compromised multiple critical infrastructure organisations, including telecommunications and energy companies. The actor maintained long-standing access to these organisations using living off the land techniques. The US assesses this is pre-positioning to enable disruptive or destructive attacks against critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict. The NCSC assesses that New Zealand’s critical infrastructure operators could be vulnerable to similar activity from PRC state-sponsored actors.

Throughout the reporting year, the NCSC published a number of advisories with its international cyber security partners detailing a range of ways in which state-sponsored cyber actors are having success against even cyber-mature organisations worldwide. The NCSC joins its partners in these publications after a robust review process to validate the nature of the threat and the usability of the information to its New Zealand customers. New Zealand organisations should ask themselves, “Could we detect this kind of activity, or what changes do we need to make to do so in future?”

The following are some of the joint publications the NCSC released to help with identifying and mitigating cyber threats linked to state-sponsored actors:

*   In July 2024, the NCSC joined the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre and other international partners to release an advisory outlining a PRC state-sponsored cyber group, APT40, and the threat it posed to Australian networks. https://www.ncsc.govt.nz/alerts/prc-mss-tradecraft-in-action/
*   In September 2024, the NCSC joined international partners to highlight and help mitigate the threat posed by a botnet created by PRC-linked cyber actors to enable malicious cyber activity. https://www.ncsc.govt.nz/alerts/cyber-security-agencies-call-out-prc-linked-botnet-and-provide-mitigation-advice/
*   In April 2025, the NCSC joined its UK counterpart and others in warning of spyware targeting Taiwanese, Tibetan, Uyghur groups and civil society actors. https://www.ncsc.govt.nz/alerts/moonshine-and-badbazaar-spyware-targeting-communities-and-groups/
*   In August 2025, the NCSC warned that PRC-linked state-sponsored cyber threat actors were targeting networks globally, including telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure networks. https://www.ncsc.govt.nz/alerts/china-state-sponsored-actors-target-networks-globally/

#### The New Zealand landscape

Cyber intrusions and incidents with potential national significance continue to threaten our safety, security and wellbeing.

Incidents linked to state-sponsored actors in the reporting year included:

*   compromise of a virtual private network (VPN) appliance in a medium-sized telecommunication company,
*   brute-forcing attempts against a central government organisation, and
*   spear-phishing of senior public servants.

In the 2024/25 year, nearly a quarter of the incidents of potential national significance the NCSC dealt with had suspected state-sponsored links (82 of 331 incidents). In the previous year, this proportion was 32% (110 of 343 incidents).

The apparent downward trend in reporting numbers does not reflect a softening in the threat landscape. We have continued to observe significant attacks and intrusions, which require effective management and mitigation.

The boundaries between state and criminal activity are blurring as some governments tolerate, enable and sometimes even benefit from criminal groups operating within their jurisdictions.

State-sponsored cyber actors continue to pose a persistent threat to New Zealand. We are aware of some incidents that could have had much more severe impact if they had not been detected at an early stage. An example is presented in Case Study 1.

Additionally, as the modus operandi of some state-sponsored actors is to remain undetected, compromises can come to light much later than they occur. The international exposure of the sophisticated and high-profile cyber campaigns tracked as Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon has demonstrated the level of capability and potential impact of state-sponsored actors linked to the PRC Government.

##### CASE STUDY 1

NETWORK COMPROMISE FOR ESPIONAGE PURPOSES

During 2024/25, an organisation informed the NCSC that unauthorised activity had been detected on its network, and it requested assistance.

The NCSC worked with a commercial cyber security provider to assess the threat and determine how it should be contained. Through analysis undertaken by both teams, it was concluded the activity originated from a resourceful, sophisticated suspected state threat actor that was motivated by espionage.

Investigations found that the suspected state actor had connected to an appliance on the victim’s network. The appliance had been running an outdated firmware version which was vulnerable to recently disclosed critical common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). The actor had also attempted to log into staff accounts using a range of techniques including brute-forcing, and had targeted both cloud and cloud-integrated capabilities. Based on post-compromise analysis, the actor was likely seeking to maintain persistence on the victim’s network for espionage purposes, consistent with state-sponsored motivations.

A review showed that the organisation’s existing cyber security hygiene had been decisive in stopping the actor. This included strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and network segmentation.

Through the NCSC’s unique capabilities, we verified that no data had been stolen and offered further advice on mitigating any lingering risk.

#### Three questions leaders should be asking

01  Do we have the relationships, systems and processes to provide for early warning and coordinated response?
02  Are we confident in our ability to detect a sophisticated actor using living off the land type techniques?
03  Have we tested our ability to respond to a sophisticated intrusion designed not just to steal, but to remain undetected?

#### Implications for organisations

Although critical infrastructure and government agencies are often perceived to be the main targets of state-sponsored activity, no sector is immune.

Any organisation which holds valuable information, contributes to essential services, or holds influence, may be an appealing target.

Organisations that have prepared themselves to defend against cybercriminals should be aware that preventions effective at addressing the easy access points to their systems may not be sufficient to deal with the tactics and techniques of state actors at their most sophisticated – additional measures may be required. State actors are stealthy and play the long game: they often maintain undetected access for months or years, and the impact to your organisation may not be felt immediately. Detecting these actors can require an in-depth understanding of what baseline activity is expected on your network, in order to notice tell-tale variances.

## JUDGEMENT 2 | WHAKATAUNGA 2

### The commercialisation of cybercrime means cybercriminals have more tools
### Nā te tāhoko o te taihara ipurangi kua nui atu ngā utauta ki ngā nanakia ipurangi

#### EXAMPLES

*   In April 2024, MediSecure – a holder of sensitive Australian health data – discovered a database had been encrypted by ransomware actors. Later investigations discovered that over 12 million transactional records across a four-year window had been breached.
*   In July 2025, Qantas suffered a customer data breach numbering millions of records, including from New Zealand. Criminals later released data on the dark web.
*   Financially motivated cyber attacks in the UK on Marks & Spencer in April 2025 and Jaguar Land Rover in September 2025 crippled operations and are estimated to have cost the firms hundreds of millions of dollars.
*   In September 2025, airports across Europe experienced disruption to check-in technology following a ransomware attack.

Globally, the shift to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has commercialised cybercrime, allowing criminals to ‘rent’ effective attack tools, and for criminal groups to specialise in different elements of the attack. Meanwhile, new technologies such as AI are accelerating their work and effectiveness.

Cybercriminals are responsible for most of the incidents New Zealanders report to the NCSC. The end goal for cybercriminals is usually financial gain; however, they may carry out activities that are indirectly related, for example by stealing passwords and personal information, in order to stage future attacks.

Ransomware continues to be the most damaging type of criminal attack, causing disruption as well as potential loss of money, data and sensitive information.

Ransomware activities can result not only in data loss and exposure but also disrupted operations, reputational damage, and financial cost – and in extreme cases, threats to life. It is in the interests of criminals to cause as much trouble as possible to increase their chance that an organisation will pay the ransom. Unfortunately, many of those who pay do not get their data back or their systems unlocked, and sometimes they are extorted further with the threat of releasing sensitive data.

#### Tactics and techniques

Ransomware refers to a multi-stage operation by an actor, typically involving the installation of malware to encrypt files, exfiltrate files, and demand payment. Actors seek targets where disruption will have widespread and visible impact, to increase their chances of being paid.

High-value targets include essential services like transportation, where disruption is costly and highly impactful, and organisations with sensitive personal information such as healthcare and government agencies.

For cybercriminals, any opportunity is a good one, however many prepare by conducting research or social engineering to identify valuable targets and increase their chances of success.

Ransomware perpetrators are financially motivated. Of the moderate to significant ransomware incidents reported to the NCSC in 2024/25, all were linked to suspected financially motivated non-state actors.

Cybercriminals use a range of tools to speed up and support their work. For example, vulnerability scanning gives malicious actors a list of potential targets they can attack en masse or target specifically.

With the advent of RaaS, ransomware attacks now require reduced technical expertise to deploy, lowering barriers to entry. The proliferation of RaaS has led to specialisation and corporate-level execution; defenders now find themselves dealing with experienced and professional negotiators.

More than half of the significant incidents the NCSC analysed in 2024/25 were likely to involve use of RaaS.

RaaS continues to evolve, developing new features to assist cyber actors with avoiding detection, victim engagement and money laundering.

The use of AI has only added to the threat (see below).

##### AI AND CYBER SECURITY RISKS – AMPLIFICATION THROUGH AUTOMATION

Cybercriminals have been early adopters of AI. As a result, attackers no longer need advanced technical skills to launch convincing and scalable attacks. Generative models can create personalised phishing emails in flawless English or te reo Māori, assemble convincing deepfakes for extortion or romance scams, and even write or adapt malicious code. For organisations with thousands of employees and complex supply chains, this means there’s a much higher likelihood that at least one employee will fall victim to a convincing scam.

Automation is another major factor. AI can rapidly scan networks for vulnerabilities, test stolen credentials, or exploit misconfigured cloud services. Large New Zealand companies – such as those in finance, energy, health, and telecommunications – may hold valuable data and provide critical services, making them attractive targets. The scale and speed of AI-driven attacks could overwhelm traditional security teams, especially if basic cyber hygiene is lacking. Still, automation benefits both sides: rapid detection and response must outpace automated attacks to remain effective.

AI doesn’t reinvent cybercrime, but it supercharges methods and scale. For New Zealand – where a few successful incidents can cause outsized disruption – the implications are that organisations need to close basic security gaps while also carefully leveraging AI for defence.

#### The New Zealand landscape

Cybercrime continues to have a significant impact on New Zealanders. Of the 331 incidents of potential national significance the NCSC dealt with in the past year, 137 were linked to criminal or financially motivated cyber actors – more than double the year before (65).

The direct financial loss from cyber security incidents reported to the NCSC in 2024/2025 totalled $26.9M, up from $21.6 million in 2023/2024.

These figures are indicative only: the full impact is likely to be much more. A consumer survey commissioned by the NCSC indicated that New Zealanders could be losing as much as $1.6 billion each year to cybercriminals and scammers. In addition, organisations frequently incur operational and reputational losses, and individuals are affected by the associated stress.

Our research also tells us that 53% of New Zealand’s small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) experienced a cyber threat between January and June 2025, a significant increase from the 36% reported in 2024. The impact of these cyber threats on those businesses also increased.

##### CASE STUDY 2

RANSOMWARE IN THE HEALTH SECTOR

In May 2025, the NCSC received an incident notification from an organisation in the health sector that had been impacted by ransomware. Many of the organisation’s servers and endpoint devices had been encrypted, and a large amount of data was stolen.

The organisation’s IT provider helped it to take initial remediation steps, which included changing credentials, updating accounts, and deploying extra security measures. The NCSC assisted the organisation by providing technical assistance to help remediate the problem and understand how the ransomware was able to enter its systems.

Research indicates that while SMEs understand that cyber security is important, complacency often prevents them from implementing some of the most important security practices.

Ransomware continues to have devastating impacts on New Zealand organisations. In 2024/25, 88 reports of ransomware were recorded by the NCSC, compared to 63 the year before.

These included the following:

*   An agriculture producer’s IT infrastructure was infected with ransomware, halting production.
*   An IT provider’s virtual machines were encrypted, causing service disruption, and their backups were deleted, preventing rebuilding.
*   A financial service provider was infected with ransomware, compromising documents containing customers’ personal information.

Most of the more impactful ransomware incidents the NCSC dealt with in the past year resulted in either suspected or confirmed data exfiltration. The exfiltration of data and the threat of exposing it publicly can provide criminals with additional leverage.

The NCSC determined that a lack of MFA on an important service had enabled a threat actor to gain access. Fortunately, the organisation had completed system backups just one hour before the ransomware activity occurred. By restoring from these recent backups, it was able to successfully recover its systems and quickly return to normal operations.

This event shows how good security practices – in this case frequent backups – can help mitigate or prevent ransomware incidents. The organisation may have avoided the incident entirely – and prevented data from being stolen – if it had also implemented MFA across its critical systems.

#### Implications for organisations

Many cyber criminals are skilled, motivated, and well-organised, with a range of effective tools at their disposal. Organisations need to be aware of the way that criminals continue to innovate, whether it’s deepfake phishing videos or calls, or deploying information-stealing malware, and how to detect and prevent these.

Through ransomware attacks, cybercriminals can cause significant disruption to business operations, and their extortion activities can damage your reputation with clients and stakeholders. Organisations of all sizes can be targeted. Paying does not guarantee recovery, or that your sensitive data won’t be released.

The New Zealand Government recommends not paying a ransom. Payment does not guarantee that you will get your data back, may breach sanctions, and creates harm to others by providing funding for criminal activities.

#### Three questions leaders should be asking

01  If ransomware impacted our critical systems tomorrow, could we continue operating without paying?
02  Do we understand the personal information we hold and how we store and protect it?
03  Have we tested crisis management, legal, and communications processes for a ransomware event?

The direct financial loss from cyber security incidents reported to the NCSC in 2024/2025 totalled $26.9M, up from $21.6 million in 2023/2024.

## JUDGEMENT 3 | WHAKATAUNGA 3

### Hacktivists are targeting New Zealand organisations as global conflicts escalate
### Kei te whakaeke ngā mūrere ngā whakahaere o Aotearoa i te nui haere kē atu o ngā whawhai o te ao

Hacktivism usually seeks to cause disruption to business, sector, or state to promote political or social causes. The goal of hacktivist groups is visibility rather than financial gain, but their activities can still undermine trust, damage reputations, and disrupt services.

Unlike state actors or organised cybercriminals, hacktivists often rely on basic but noisy techniques. Issue-motivated cyber actors rarely seek payment or issue demands and frequently claim responsibility for the activity. Their actions may not cause long-term harm, but they can create operational headaches and public embarrassment.

#### Tactics and techniques

Hacktivists will commonly use distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and website defacements to cause visible disruption.

DDoS attacks cause an excess of traffic to a network, which can lead to the degradation or inaccessibility of the target network, and sometimes data corruption.

Attack tools are widely available, lowering barriers to entry.

In many cases, actors command sizable botnet infrastructure to orchestrate and sustain DDoS attacks.

Hacktivists will usually target sectors with the highest potential for significant and visible disruption, such as government services, banks and other financial institutions, news media, transport, utilities and retail.

However, the NCSC has observed that hacktivist groups sometimes use opportunistic criteria for target selection, such as existing vulnerabilities and victim availability, rather than a strategic focus on particular organisations.

Large organisations generally engage managed service providers for DDoS mitigation, limiting impact. Smaller businesses, such as those that openly support particular political views or conflict-related activities, could be vulnerable because they often do not have mitigation services in place.

The line between state-sponsored cyber operations and hacktivism has increasingly blurred, with state involvement ranging from direct to indirect. For example:

*   Proxies are employed directly to act.
*   ‘True believer’ but independently motivated individuals or organisations conduct attacks aligned with foreign state interests.
*   States may turn a blind eye to activity emanating from within their borders.

#### EXAMPLES

*   In the 2024/25 year pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian hacktivist groups both conducted global distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns against financial institutions and government sites, including in New Zealand.
*   In the same period, environmental and social-justice hacktivists targeted energy companies and public agencies globally to amplify their causes.

#### The New Zealand landscape

The NCSC is aware of activity associated with hacktivist groups affecting New Zealand organisations during the 2024/25 period. These incidents have often coincided with political activities or statements:

*   In October 2024, the NCSC recorded DDoS attacks against a range of financial sector organisations. This occurred at a similar time to multiple pro-Russian campaigns targeting Western governments.
*   In June 2025, when the New Zealand Government pledged more financial support to Ukraine, the NCSC recorded DDoS campaigns against organisations in the government, transport, and water sector.

While there has been an increase in the frequency of ideologically motivated cyber incidents in New Zealand, they have had varied success to date.

Nevertheless, disruption can affect customer trust, even if the technical impact is minimal.

There has also been a handful of low-impact New Zealand cyber incidents against operational technology (OT) claimed by hacktivist groups. In situations where OT is less protected, actors setting out to create a nuisance may end up causing significant damage beyond what they expected, escalating tensions and causing unintended consequences.

Although by definition a hacktivist group is motivated by its beliefs, some activity that appears as hacktivism may have other motives.

Hacktivist campaigns may overlap with state or criminal activity, complicating attribution and defence.

At least two known hacktivist groups active against New Zealand were likely created as an unattributable platform for conducting state-sponsored malicious cyber activities.

The actors behind these kinds of cyber incidents probably view DDoS attacks as harder to attribute, plausibly deniable, and unlikely to trigger an escalatory response from the countries affected.

The NCSC anticipates this type of ideologically motivated malicious cyber activity is likely to continue if geostrategic competition trends continue internationally. We assess that the government, financial, news, utilities, IT and retail sectors are most likely to be targeted, due to the potential for noticeable disruption. Cyber actors conducting this kind of activity will target sectors most impacted by digital disruption, as this will help amplify their message.

#### Implications for organisations

The targets of hacktivism are usually symbolic, for example a media organisation, bank or telecommunications company taking a particular stance on a contentious issue, or associated with a certain country. In such cases, an organisation with a New Zealand connection could inadvertently become a target if hacktivists oppose New Zealand Government policy.

Organisations should consider whether they could be targeted by hacktivists for any reason, and what the impact of a typical hacktivist attack would be on the organisation’s business continuity and reputation.

DDoS attacks are much easier to defend against if controls are in place already, rather than trying to mitigate once an attack is underway.

#### Three questions leaders should be asking

01  Have we assessed our risk profile in relation to hacktivism?
02  Are our websites and online services resilient to denial-of-service attacks?
03  Do we have a plan for communication and reputation management if our organisation becomes a symbolic target?

##### CASE STUDY 3

HACKTIVISM WITH UNCLEAR MOTIVES

In April 2025, a New Zealand organisation in the health sector began experiencing a high-volume distributed DDoS attack early one morning, causing service outages. Later that same day, the organisation received an extortion email that claimed the attack was being orchestrated by a known hacktivist group. The email threatened to increase the severity of the attack unless a Bitcoin payment was made. However, the email did not specify why this particular organisation had been targeted.

By the evening of the attack, the impacted organisation was able to implement security measures to mitigate the attack and return traffic to normal levels. The following morning, the organisation received another note claiming the attack had been a demonstration, and that the attack would resume with greater severity if the ransom payment was not received. The impacted organisation ensured that adequate security measures had been implemented, and maintained a state of readiness to respond to further attacks. However, no further DDoS activity was observed.

## JUDGEMENT 4 | WHAKATAUNGA 4

### Threat actors are exploiting supply chains, hidden dependencies and organisational blind spots to cause impact
### Kei te urutomo ngā kaiwhakatuma i ngā ara tukutuku, ngā tūhononga i waenga wae pūmanawa tē mōhiotia, me ngā wāhi huna o ngā whakahaere kia nui ai te tūkinotia

Malicious actors are increasingly circumventing organisations’ defences by targeting blind spots in the form of supply chain vulnerabilities or other dependencies that may be overlooked.

Supply chain attacks are conducted by both financially motivated criminals and state-sponsored actors.

Other examples of organisational blind spots include legacy technology, configuration errors, and incomplete closure of accounts
