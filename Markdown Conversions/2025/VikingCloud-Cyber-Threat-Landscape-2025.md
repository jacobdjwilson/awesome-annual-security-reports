## Nation-State Attacks Are a Top Concern

Nearly

80%

of cybersecurity leaders are concerned or extremely

concerned they could be targeted—directly or indirectly—

by a nation-state cyberattack in the next 12 months.

Geopolitical tensions are high, and cyberwarfare is becoming more prevalent. Nation-state

hackers—cybercriminals backed or directed by foreign governments—are impacting a wider

range of organizations today, as companies of all sizes and in all industries can be affected by

nation-state attacks that ripple through software supply chains. Nation-state cyberattacks are

typically more advanced, persistent, and well-funded than those carried out by independent

hackers or criminal groups and can cause significant operational disruption and financial loss.

These hackers typically focus on long-term access, IP theft, and espionage, and they typically

infiltrate by exploiting third-party software vulnerabilities. Many are leveraging AI to scale

their attacks. Most businesses’ standard security practices and tools aren’t built to detect or

defend against these advanced threats. And as the U.S. federal government pulls back on

cybersecurity oversight, companies are facing these threats with fewer resources, reduced

guidance, and less warning.

In fact, 76% believe that recent or proposed cuts to U.S. federal cybersecurity programs, such

as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency

(NSA), and others, could increase their organization’s cyber risk.

It’s important for all businesses to invest in proactive defense measures, but especially

smaller or mid-sized firms, which are becoming prime targets for nation-state actors and are

at increased risk of getting caught in the crossfire.

## Rising Cyberattacks Are Fueled by AI and Insiders
Cybersecurity leaders say the frequency (71%) and severity (61%) of cyberattacks have

increased in the past year. 59% say their companies were hit with at least one successful

cyberattack in the past 12 months. Over half (52%) lost more than 5% of their total revenue as a

result.

This year’s report shows a clear shift: more cybersecurity leaders say the
frequency and severity of attacks are growing, underscoring the escalating
threat environment.

In 2025, 71% report rising attack frequency and 61% cite
increasing severity—compared to 46% and 41% respectively
in 2024.

For a company with an annual revenue of $500M, that’s at least $25 million in financial

impact from a single attack. For a smaller business with $5 million in revenue, that would

mean at least $250K in losses. In fact, these types of damaging cyberattacks can cause some

businesses to close their doors. According to a VikingCloud survey earlier this year, 55% of

small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) would go out of business from cyberattack

impacts of less than $50,000.

Two primary drivers of the influx of cyberattacks were AI and insider threats.

58%

of those attacked in the

said over a quarter of their team’s

## Cyberattacks Are Underreported—Which Leaves
C-Suites in the Dark

71%

of cybersecurity leaders would consider
not reporting a cybersecurity incident.

Underreporting cyberattacks is

C-suites and board directors need a full picture of their company’s cyber risk to make

informed decisions. A strong cybersecurity defense requires creating a company security

culture that provides a safe space for reporting all incidents. It’s up to cyber and broader

executive leadership to create those clear reporting protocols and establish a culture of

continuous learning and improvement.

## Cybersecurity Teams Still Can’t Keep Up with
AI-Driven Attacks

AI-driven attacks are still evolving faster than most teams can keep up.

68%

of companies are only moderately or somewhat
confident in their organization’s ability to detect
and defend against AI-driven threats in real time.

Cybersecurity leaders say their top 3 challenges are that (1) AI is creating new attack points

(53%), (2) the tech behind cyberattacks is more sophisticated than the tech their teams have

access to (36%), and (3) modern cybercriminals are more advanced than their internal teams

(36%).

When asked broadly about which cyberattacks they’re least prepared for, ransomware attacks

on their business (46%) topped the list—up from 28% last year. This is a growing preparedness

gap, likely due to hackers’ greater attack sophistication with AI and the rise of ransomware as a

service (RaaS), which lowers the barrier to entry and increases attack volume.

Other attacks cybersecurity leaders say they’re

least prepared for (which are all becoming

more sophisticated with AI) include:

Phishing or other social engineering attacks.

Ransomware attacks on critical third parties.

Deepfake attacks.

Zero-day vulnerability exploits.

## Leadership Teams Are
Waking Up to the Dangers
of AI Threats
Generative or agentic AI-driven phishing attacks

(51%) are leadership teams’ top concern when it

comes to new cyberattack techniques. Last year, only

22% of respondents said that their leadership teams

were concerned about generative AI phishing attacks.

This suggests that more leadership teams recognize

the perils of AI-driven attack methods, especially as

agentic AI becomes more ubiquitous and makes bad

“Phishing has become a top

concern, not just because it’s

more convincing, but because

it’s faster, more scalable, and

increasingly autonomous. With

It takes much less skill and

campaigns that evade

traditional security defenses.

the threat landscape in ways

that organizations are just

starting to grasp."

hacking (45%) and AI-vishing (voice deepfake)

attacks (43%) are the other two most concerning

modern threats.

Leadership teams are also specifically

concerned about the following attack methods:

Deepfake attacks.

Ransomware as a service.

AI model evasion.

Generative AI processing chip attacks.

## How Organizations Are Responding
to Today’s Threat Landscape
In the past 12 months, cybersecurity leaders say their

organizations have increased security and awareness training

(51%) and improved network security (47%) to proactively

address cyber threats. 33% have allocated additional budget

to their cyber program, a stark increase from the 7% who said

they were increasing their budgets last year.

Evolving Defenses:
Comparing 2024 and 2025 Cyber Priorities

Additional budget allocation
(7%         33%).

Security and awareness training
(35%         51%).

Hiring of cyber talent
(12%         25%).

Securing the software development lifecycle
(17%         26%).

With 36% of cybersecurity leaders reporting over a quarter of

their incidents being caused by insiders—whether accidental

or malicious—organizations are recognizing that their

employees serve as the first and last line of defense against

sophisticated cyber threats.

Training is now the top way organizations are responding to

an influx of threats, with 51% saying they’ve increased general

security and awareness training—a 46% increase compared

with those who said they were doing this in 2024.

36% of cyber leaders say over a quarter of cyber incidents start

inside the organization—proof that  people, not just technology, are

the frontline of defense.

8/16

Copyright © 2025 VikingCloud, Inc. or its affiliates.The 2025 Cyber Threat Landscape Report

The focus on AI-specific training is particularly telling. 43% have provided training on both

generative AI and agentic AI cybersecurity risks, while 40% have provided training on

either generative AI (23%) or agentic AI (17%). As cybercriminals leverage AI to create more

convincing phishing attempts and sophisticated social engineering attacks, organizations are

racing to educate their workforce about these evolving threats.

This investment in human-centered defense acknowledges a hard truth: the most advanced

security systems can be undone by a single employee clicking the wrong link or falling victim

to an AI-generated deepfake. By prioritizing training, organizations are building their most

scalable and sustainable cyber defense.

Nearly 5x as many cyber leaders are allocating additional
budget to cyber programs compared to last year.

Only 16% report insufficient budget to hire additional staff (compared to
31% last year). Just 13% don’t have enough budget to invest in new tech
(compared to 35% last year).

Confidence in incident response times is on the rise, which could be a result of the steps

companies are taking. In 2024, 65% of cyber leaders said it would take over 3 days to recognize

and initiate a response to cyberattacks they feel least prepared for. Today, 65% say it would

take less than 3 days.

The takeaway is clear: AI is changing the threat landscape—and companies are starting to

evolve their strategies and defenses alongside. These changes are only going so far, and the

evolution is seemingly slow, given nearly 60% still suffered an attack this past year.

## Reliance on Outsourced Defenses Climbs
Year-over-year data shows that many businesses are turning to managed security service

providers (MSSPs) to help close gaps in their defenses. Today, 66% of organizations rely on MSSPs

in some capacity to augment internal defenses—up 2x from 2024.

MSSP support can help cybersecurity teams solve several key
challenges and evolve their defenses for today’s threat landscape
faster.

Evolving defenses for the age of AI:
36% of cybersecurity leaders still admit that modern cybercriminals are more advanced

than their internal teams. 41% say they would prioritize a cybersecurity partner that offers

GenAI and agentic AI solutions that are cost-effective and easy to use.

A lack of qualified talent:
Nearly a third (31%) still lack access to qualified talent, up from last year (19%). 31% would

prioritize a partner that augments the skills of their internal team. 39% say the same for

tech that helps alleviate the impacts of the cybersecurity talent shortage.

Vendor overload creates complexity:
 1 in 5 say they work with too many cybersecurity vendors, which is challenging to manage.

20% would seek a single vendor for all their cybersecurity needs. 37% would prioritize a

cybersecurity partner that enables them to see their threats in a single platform.

Outdated tech hinders cybersecurity efforts:
36% of cybersecurity leaders report that the tech behind cyberattacks is more

sophisticated than the tech their team has access to. 40% would seek a vendor that helps

predict cyber events before they impact their business.
