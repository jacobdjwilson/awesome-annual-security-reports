Trends Report

2025

## Foreword

The past year was a busy one for IT and security leaders. On top of the usual responsibilities and everyday threats, security teams grappled with the continued emergence and adoption of transformative AI technologies, an evolving and uncertain regulatory climate, rising global tensions, as well as arguably the largest IT outage in history.

The Arctic Wolf State of Cybersecurity: 2025 Trends Report is an opportunity for decision makers to share their experiences over the past 12 months and their perspectives on some of the most important issues shaping the IT and security landscape.

Our research reveals that ransomware continues to be a perennial area of concern, but for the first time in four years, it isn’t the top concern for IT and security leaders. This year, AI ranks at the top of the list as indicated by 29% of respondents, relegating ransomware to second place.

The percentage of organizations reporting being victim to a ransomware attack also declined with 23% of respondents disclosing that their organization experienced at least one “significant” ransomware attack in 2024, compared to last year’s response of 45%.

While the reduction in ransomware attacks is positive news, still 70% of security leaders polled report that their organization experienced at least one “significant cyber attack” in 2024.

It makes sense then that in response to growing attacks, IT and security leaders are actively preparing to respond to incidents, with 88% of organizations having purchased an active incident response (IR) retainer.

The large adoption of IR retainers points to a trend in recognizing the necessity of having risk transference measures at the ready in the face of crisis. However, when examining respondents’ adoption and usage of risk mitigation solutions, a less uniform and overall, less positive picture emerged.

Despite the broad adoption of next-generation endpoint security solutions, visibility gaps remain. Additionally, nearly a quarter of those polled report outright dissatisfaction with an element in their security stack, citing high rate of false positives (34%) and lack of efficacy (33%) as their top challenges.

Looking ahead, data transformation and AI adoption is the most frequently cited driver of cybersecurity investments for the coming year, yet conversely, 18% of security leaders indicate that AI devices delivered the least amount of value in the past year.

While the current level of AI exuberance feels at direct odds with limited security outcomes AI investments have delivered to date, integrating AI into a proven solution to augment the broader set of people, processes, and technologies provides more upside than operating under the expectation that entire security functions can be delivered by an AI engine.

Ultimately, the hype around AI may distract from more important — and more effective — security investments, many of which are far more mundane, yet far more impactful in maximizing positive security outcomes.

As you review the report and accompanying analysis, our hope is that the insights provided help you and your organization improve resilience in the months and years ahead.

## Methodology

The survey was conducted among 1,200 IT and security decision makers at director level or above, from organizations with 50+ employees, across the U.S., U.K., Canada, ANZ (Australia, New Zealand), DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), the Nordic regions (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland), Benelux (Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg), and South Africa, during January and February 2025.

**Respondents**
- 46% Director or Vice President
- 36% C-Level Executive
- 19% Owners

**Regions**
- U.S.
- U.K.
- DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
- ANZ (Australia, New Zealand)
- Canada
- Benelux (Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg)
- South Africa
- Nordics (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland)

In this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 2.8 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.

## Regional Trends

### EMEA

**IRELAND**
Organizations in Ireland were the least likely to maintain an active IR plan to respond to threats when they occur.
Across the full respondent population, 60% of organizations maintain an active Incident Response (IR) plan — yet in Ireland only 30% of organizations are prepared with an up-to-date IR plan.

**NORDICS**
More than half (51%) of respondents from the Nordics (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) reported that their organization suffered a BEC attack — 16% higher than the global average.
This is plausibly due to the prevalence of banking and finance services companies, as our threat research regularly shows BEC threat actors target organizations in the financial sector.

**U.K.**
Good backup practices led to only 13% of respondents from the United Kingdom citing a lack of sufficient backups as the reason why their organization paid a ransom — one third of the global rate (39%).
With reliable backups, why are victims in the U.K. still choosing to pay the ransom? We found 60% — 11% above the global average — electing to pay to speed up recovery.

### ANZ

Respondents from Australia and New Zealand reported intellectual property, data, and privacy protection as the main driver of their security strategies, while AI Adoption drives strategies for the rest of the globe.

Organizations in Australia and New Zealand were 9% more likely to suffer a “significant” cyber attack than the global average (85% versus 76%).

Consistent with their top driver of security strategy, 74% of victimized organizations in Australia and New Zealand that paid a ransom did so to prevent the release of stolen data — well above the global average of 50%.

### North America

**CANADA**
Organizations in Canada are taking a more measured and apprehensive approach to emerging technologies than those in other nations, with 40% of respondents from Canada reporting that their organization has already implemented policies totally banning the usage of generative AI and LLMs (ChatGPT), compared to a 30% global average.

**UNITED STATES**
When asked about cybersecurity budgets, 18% of respondents from the United States felt their organization was incorrectly investing their budgets and creating an imbalance, either by overspending on technology that was being underutilized, or by overspending on expertise to the detriment of technology investments.

**UNITED STATES / CANADA**
Organizations in Canada appear may be understaffing their security programs. Of all the countries polled, respondents from Canada were the least likely to indicate that their organization had adequate staffing, with only 36% doing so — compared to 48% in the United States and 50% globally.

## Threat Trends

### Trend 1: AI Emerges as the Leading Cybersecurity Concern

Security leaders have a lot to worry about. Headlines and security alerts offer near-constant reminders that the threat environment is always evolving. At the same time, each and every organization’s security posture is always in a state of flux.

Given such a dynamic context, it’s always revealing to discover what security leaders consider to be their primary area of concern.

This year, we have a new ‘winner,’ with “AI, large language models (LLMs), and associated privacy concerns” chosen by 29% of respondents.

**What is your primary area of concern when it comes to cybersecurity in general? (select one)**
- AI, large language models, and associated privacy concerns: 29%
- Malware / ransomware and data extortion: 21%
- Credential theft / identity concerns: 15%
- Cloud access and misconfiguration: 13%
- Social engineering / insider threats / phishing: 10%
- Misconfigurations and unpatched vulnerabilities: 6%
- Business email compromise: 6%

**Plan for the future, but don’t overlook the present**

In taking the top spot, AI relegates longtime leading concern ransomware to second place (21%). Plus, the Arctic Wolf 2025 Threat Report showed that ransomware and BEC attacks aren’t mere inconveniences — they account for 44% and 27%, respectively, of incident response (IR) cases investigated by Arctic Wolf.

It’s encouraging that security leaders take the threats associated with AI very seriously. However, it is important to remember that while AI has the ability to automate, accelerate, and enhance attacks, whether that’s crafting more convincing phishing emails or more easily identifying system vulnerabilities, AI is the tool by which threats are being delivered and enhanced but, AI is not the threat itself.

A real risk with AI’s novelty and hype is that it is distracting from genuinely larger risks. For example (as we’ll see a little later), the survey revealed that many organizations experienced ransomware or business email compromise (BEC) attacks.

Similarly, identity is becoming a major battleground in modern cybersecurity, and today’s threat actors are adept at finding and leveraging credentials that allow them to log into services and move unnoticed around victim environments. Moreover, attackers routinely employ social engineering and take advantage of misconfigurations to pursue their objectives.

The challenge for security leaders is to simultaneously develop and implement plans to safeguard against emerging threats without downplaying or overlooking those that are all too real today.

### Trend 2: Breaches Remain All Too Common, and Disclosure Obligations Are Forcing Transparency

In a cybersecurity context, a data breach is an incident in which one or more unauthorized parties access computer data, applications, networks, or devices.

Unfortunately, such incidents remain all too common. The survey responses indicate that in the last 12 months, 52% of organizations identified one or more breaches within their environment (up from 48% a year ago).

But the story doesn’t end there, as an additional 23% of respondents conceded that they were unsure if a breach had occurred. In other words, they lacked sufficient visibility and detection capabilities to rule out the possibility.

Flipped around, these findings reveal that only 25% of security leaders can say with any confidence that their organization had not suffered a breach in the last 12 months — a significant decrease over last year (35%).

Of those organizations that knew with certainty they had been victimized, 97% disclosed the breach (consistent with last year’s 96%). This high rate of disclosure is due mostly to obligations: 51% of respondents reported disclosing due to a legal requirement to do so, while a further 34% cited a requirement from either an insurance provider or other outside entity.

**In the last 12 months, has your organization suffered a breach? (select one)**
- Yes, we are certain a breach has occurred: 52%
- Possibly, we are unsure whether a breach occurred: 23%
- No, we are certain a breach hasn’t occurred: 25%
- Other: 1%
- Unsure: 1%

**Did your organization disclose the breach? (select one)**
- Yes, we are required by law: 51%
- Yes, as required by our insurance provider or another outside entity: 34%
- Yes, to share our findings with the broader security community: 12%
- No, we were legally prevented from doing so: 3%
- No, for fear of brand damage: 1%

**Security leaders adopt a more realistic perspective**

There are two ways to look at the key finding that only a quarter of respondents are confident their organization didn’t suffer a breach (and it’s likely there’s some truth in each).

The pessimistic view is that despite continued spending on cybersecurity, confidence is decreasing. This speaks to an observation that Arctic Wolf has made time and again: that cybersecurity has an effectiveness problem.

The optimistic view is that security leaders have considerably less misplaced confidence than in years past. In other words, leaders are adopting more realistic perspectives on the difficulty of detecting breaches. This shift may be informed by past experiences, like the famous SolarWinds supply chain compromise that forced many organizations to come to terms with the fact they had been breached for months without being aware of the fact.

For additional context, more than 62% of initial Arctic Wolf deployments reveal one or more latent threats (a hidden or dormant risk within an environment that hadn’t been detected by the organization’s existing security measures).

As noted above, the sustained high rate of disclosure is due mainly to obligations. For readers in the United States, it’s worth noting that even though there’s some uncertainty around the future of federal-level regulation, many states have passed their own disclosure laws. Plus, we can reasonably expect insurers to continue to require disclosure as part of the claims process.

But let’s take a moment to tip our caps to the 12% of organizations that made the admirable decision to disclose simply to share their findings with the broader security community. We’re all in this fight together, and such selfless transparency — despite the potential negative consequences of doing so — is a rising tide that lifts the cybersecurity community.

> More than 62% of initial Arctic Wolf deployments reveal one or more latent threats. (a hidden or dormant risk within an environment that hadn’t been detected by the organization’s existing security measures).

### Trend 3: Significant Cyber Attacks Continue, with Lasting Consequences

Looking beyond the subset of incidents that qualify as breaches, 70% of security leaders polled reported that their organization experienced at least one “significant cyber attack” in 2024.

The most common incidents were malware infections and business email compromise. Both of these threats were reported by 35% of respondents, outpacing ransomware and/or data exfiltration (23%).

**Did your organization experience a significant cyber attack in 2024? (select all that apply)**
- Yes, we suffered a significant malware infection: 35%
- Yes, we suffered a business email compromise attack: 35%
- Yes, we suffered a ransomware attack and/or data exfiltration: 23%
- Yes, other: 1%
- No: 3%
- Not sure: 3%

Nearly two thirds (64%) of the significant cyber attacks led to a loss of productivity lasting at least three months. This means that 45% of organizations, overall, experienced a cyber attack-imposed productivity loss lasting for at least one quarter in 2024.

And for some, the disruption lasted much longer: 24% of organizations that suffered a significant attack experienced productivity losses for six months or longer.

**How long did your environment experience a loss of productivity, if at all? (select one)**
- Our environment was not impacted in a significant way: 40%
- One quarter: 34%
- Two quarters: 19%
- Three quarters: 4%
- One year or longer: 1%
- Not sure: 1%

**Preserving productivity requires prioritizing security investments**

First, let’s address an elephant in the room: more than half (56%) of the organizations that experienced a significant cyber attack had not implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA). Nowadays, strong phishing-resistant MFA (e.g., based on the FIDO2 set of specifications) should be regarded as a basic, fundamental, non-negotiable element of an organization’s security posture. The MFA hurdle can help not only to stop attackers from gaining initial access, but also to thwart intrusion actions.

Second, let’s return to the seeming disconnect first noted in Trend No. 1: that AI’s security and privacy implications represent the leading cybersecurity concern, even though malware, BEC, and ransomware attacks are common occurrences leading to prolonged losses of productivity (among many other consequences). Perhaps we can reconcile these somewhat contradictory findings by pointing to human nature. After all, it seems plausible that security leaders are so familiar with these traditional attacks — and have some experience guarding against and recovering from them — that they seem more manageable compared to the still-emerging threats associated with AI.

Finally, the productivity losses underscore the importance of preparedness and prevention, which can only come by appropriately prioritizing cybersecurity investments. In other words, mature organizations should regard cybersecurity products, solutions, services, and capabilities — like MFA, for example — not as sunk expenses, but as investments to preserve continuity and protect productivity.

> More than half of the organizations that experienced a significant cyber attack had not implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### Trend 4: Ransomware is Still a Major Problem, But Professional Negotiators Are Reducing Payouts

As shown previously, 23% of respondents reported that their organization experienced at least one “significant” ransomware attack in 2024.

Notably, this is substantially lower than the previous year (45%), although the higher figure may have been swelled by incidents that weren’t deemed by the victims to be “significant.”

More than three quarters (76%) of the organizations that experienced a significant ransomware attack elected to pay the ransom, down slightly from last year’s figure (83%). Within this group, 43% of victimized organizations (33% overall) made the payment entirely from their own coffers, whereas 57% of victims (43% of organizations overall) received at least some funds from their insurance provider or another outside entity.

The overwhelming majority — fully 90% — of ransomware victims engaged the services of a professional ransomware negotiator. For more than half of those who went this route (52%), doing so led to a reduced ransom. In contrast, only 30% of organizations that handled negotiations themselves were able to secure a reduction.

**Was the ransom paid? (select one)**
- Yes, the ransom was paid by our organization only: 43%
- Yes, but we were still required to pay the full demand amount: 47%
- Yes, but the ransom was paid in some capacity by our insurance provider / outside entity: 33%
- No, the ransom was not paid: 1%
- Not sure: 3%

**Did you hire or utilize a professional outsourced ransomware negotiator? (select one)**
- Yes, and we only paid a portion of the demand: 43%
- No, and we paid the full demand amount: 47%
- No, and we only paid a portion of the demand: 7%

**Why did you pay the ransom? (select all that apply)**
- To prevent the release of stolen data: 50%
- To avoid costs associated with recovering the data: 50%
- To avoid issues with downtime / impacted operations: 49%
- We were advised to pay based on having no other alternative: 48%
- Due to lack of sufficient data back ups: 39%

**Preparedness and professional negotiation pay off**

The lower reported rate of ransomware attacks is consistent with other observations — including those shared within the Arctic Wolf 2025 Threat Report — that suggest some combination of decreased ransomware activity and increased resilience to such incidents. Notwithstanding these favorable signs, the ransomware landscape has seldom been noted for its constancy, so organizations shouldn’t overlook the ongoing risk.

Shifting attention to ransom payments, we’ll first note that Arctic Wolf’s position aligns with the general recommendations of the FBI, other law enforcement agencies, and governments: if possible, ransom demands should not be paid, as starving the perpetrators is the only way we can collectively hope to eliminate these attacks.

Nevertheless, the decision on whether to pay is one that must be made by stakeholders within the victim organization once presented with all possible information and options.

While it’s encouraging to see a year-over-year reduction in payment frequency, the 76% rate reported by this year’s respondents — despite 90% of them working with a professional negotiator — is vastly higher than the 30% payment rate within Arctic Wolf Incident Response cases (covered in our 2025 Threat Report). This disparity suggests that the capabilities of professional ransomware negotiators vary, and that it’s worth working with the most experienced and skilled ones.

Finally, the survey results underscore the importance of proper back-up and restoration practices to increase resilience against ransomware attacks. While backups don’t address the issues around data exfiltration, being able to restore business operations can buy your organization time and limit the ripple effects of the attack.

**RESPONDENT PAY OFF RATE: 76%**
**ARCTIC WOLF CASES: 30%**

> The 76% pay off rate reported by this year’s respondents is vastly higher than the 30% payment rate within Arctic Wolf Incident Response cases. (covered in our 2025 Threat Report)

## Mitigation Trends

### Trend 1: Despite Widespread Adoption of Next-Generation Endpoint Security Solutions, Visibility Gaps Persist

An endpoint is any physical device that resides at the end point of a network connection and can communicate on that network. This includes (but is not limited to) desktops, laptops, servers, mobiles, workstations, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Endpoints pose a difficult security challenge. The make and model of endpoints vary widely, as does the operating system, the apps or programs installed on them, and the security habits of each endpoint user. The rise of hybrid work has increased these challenges, as endpoints have become more portable than ever before.

The large majority of leaders polled (84%) indicated that their organization utilizes next-generation endpoint security solutions — including endpoint detection and response (EDR), endpoint protection platforms (EPP), or extended detection and response (XDR). In fact, nearly half (49%) have deployed two or more solutions. Of the 16% whose organizations don’t yet have such a solution in place, three quarters (12% of respondents overall) noted that there are plans to purchase a solution in the next 12 months.

**Does your organization currently utilize one or more next generation endpoint security solutions (EPP, EDR, XDR)? (select one)**
- We have just one endpoint solution we use: 35%
- We have more than one endpoint solution that we use: 49%
- We do not have any endpoint solutions currently but plan to purchase one or more in the next 12 months: 12%
- We do not currently have any endpoint solutions, and have no plans to purchase any: 2%
- Unsure: 2%

**Closing visibility gaps**

A successful approach to endpoint security is one that includes visibility into any physical device that can transmit and receive data on your network. A lack of such visibility — including having too few signal sources — allows security threats to go unnoticed for far too long.

However, despite the broad adoption of next-generation endpoint security solutions, visibility gaps remain. Of those organizations that already have a solution deployed — and focusing only on desktops, laptops, and servers, while omitting IoT devices — only 40% of security leaders indicated that they have 100% coverage and expect to maintain that level in the future. By leaving gaps, those organizations are inviting risk.

It’s also worth noting that an overreliance on a single endpoint security vendor can also lead to trouble — a point that became apparent in the wake of CrowdStrike’s infamous July 2024 outage. While no vendor is immune to the potential for outages, whether they originate from attackers or internal misconfigurations, the CrowdStrike situation highlighted the critical need to eliminate single points of security failure.

To be ready for modern threats, it’s essential to ensure you have the right people, processes, and technology in place to:
- Continuously monitor your environment, even if a key technology or telemetry source goes offline
- Collaborate with a diverse set of vendors to avoid over-reliance on a single platform
- Develop a plan with your security partners for when things go wrong
- Adopt a security operations approach to minimize your overall risk

### Trend 2: Budgetary Pressures and Legacy Solutions Are Increasing Cyber Risk

In an ideal world, cybersecurity solutions are procured based on careful evaluation of capabilities, in the specific context of the purchasing organization’s IT environment, with decisions perhaps aided by input from trusted experts.

However, such a process doesn’t always play out. For example, when asked why they chose their current endpoint tool, 49% of respondents indicated that it was bundled with other security tools they purchased, 32% cited the combination of low cost and limited budget, and 24% inherited a legacy solution.

And there’s no reason to conclude that similar forces aren’t influencing other cybersecurity purchase decisions. Perhaps that’s why roughly a quarter (24%) of security leaders polled indicated that they are outright dissatisfied with one or more elements within their security stack.

While respondents pointed to a number of reasons for their dissatisfaction, the top two provide a double-whammy of a high rate of false positives and lack of efficacy. In other words, not only is the security product ineffective — a big enough problem on its own — but it also contributes to wasting the time and energy of already-burdened security personnel. On average, respondents reported that they or their teams spent over a day a week (9.4 hours) responding to false positives. Over the course of a year, this becomes 61.1 business days, or the equivalent of losing a team member for an entire quarter.

**What are the causes of your dissatisfaction? (select all that apply)**
- High rate of false positives: 34%
- Lack of efficacy: 33%
- Difficult implementation: 30%
- It is overpriced: 29%
- Lack of product capabilities: 28%
- Poor customer service: 16%

**Price is easy to measure, but is different from cost**

Today’s threat actors are simply too motivated, too persistent, and too well-equipped for organizations to place faith in the lowest-priced or most conveniently packaged security products. A tendency to procure based mainly upon price simply hides the real cost of acquisition elsewhere — in wasted time, the associated opportunity cost, and the consequences of disruptive cyber attacks — and contributes to cybersecurity’s effectiveness problem.

Instead, a cybersecurity product’s capabilities, environmental fit, and support or service should be the most important evaluation criteria. Unfortunately, only 55% of respondents were able to say that their organization procured their current endpoint tooling based on “careful evaluation and best fit for our environment.” That’s barely half, despite many of those same organizations no doubt professing that cybersecurity is a priority.

> Only 55% of respondents were able to say that their organization procured their current endpoint tooling based on “careful evaluation and best fit for our environment.”

### Trend 3: Organizations Are Managing AI Risk With Official Usage Policies

Security decision makers find themselves in the difficult position of evaluating the security risks of AI tools and services, and of developing policies on their adoption and usage.

For one thing, fully 99% — up from 94% a year ago — of leaders surveyed indicated that their organization either already has an AI policy in place (86%) or plans to do so (13%). This leaves just 1% of organizations abdicating their responsibility to make an informed choice one way or the other.

And lest one assume that organizations are defaulting to a position of adoption, the survey shows that plenty of orgs are ‘opting out,’ so to speak. While roughly two thirds of respondents indicated that their company either already has a policy in place outlining proper use of these technologies (56%) or plans to implement such a policy (11%), that leaves nearly one third (excepting the 1% noted above) who have outright forbidden usage of LLMs and GenAI (30%) or who plan to do so (2%).

**Does your organization currently have a policy in place in regards to best practices and acceptable use for the utilization and adoption of generative AI and Large Language Models? (select one)**
- Yes, we have created a policy that outlines the proper use of these technologies within our organization: 56%
- No, we have no policy in place, but we plan to implement one based on guidelines and proper use: 11%
- No, we have no policy in place, but we plan to implement one with a strict ban on its usage: 2%
- Yes, we have created a policy that strictly forbids the use of these technologies within our organization: 30%
- No, we have no policy in place and we have no plans to implement one: 1%

**Adopting a secure — and informed — position**

The sudden arrival and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), in general, and LLMs in particular is perhaps without parallel.

Spurred by both a genuine interest in the revolutionary potential of these technologies and by a fear of falling behind competitors who wholeheartedly embrace them, organizations of all stripes are making tough choices.

It’s heartening to see that fully 99% of organizations have already established, or will soon do so, a position with respect to the usage of AI within the workplace. The rapid implementation of corporate policies on the acceptable usage of artificial intelligence shows a possible turning point as decision makers are eager to break the cycle of playing “catch up” in securing technology adoption and instead prepare their organizations in advance.

To the 13% who plan to implement a usage policy one way or the other, we encourage you to do so sooner rather than later. And to the 1% who lack a policy and a plan, we’ll politely suggest that it’s better to be proactive on this issue, versus reacting after you’re forced to by some unpleasant development.

Whether or not an organization has adopted a usage policy, security leaders would do well to monitor for AI utilities falling into the “shadow IT” category. Something as ubiquitous and promising as existing and emerging AI tools is very likely to find its way into an IT environment near you.

Finally, it’s worth noting that a truly informed AI usage policy requires understanding regulatory and even contractual obligations, so leaders should be sure to work with their respective legal counsel to avoid surprises.

> 99% of organizations have already established, or will soon do so, a position with respect to the usage of AI within the workplace.

### Trend 4: AI Devices Aren’t Yet Ready For Prime Time

Due largely to the technology’s ability to quickly analyze and — over time — learn from huge data sets, many security vendors have incorporated AI (particularly machine learning, or ML) into their solutions.

While the future may eventually be AI-driven, it certainly seems like there’s considerable progress to be made before that’s the case, as 18% of security leaders indicate that AI devices currently deliver the least amount of value — a higher percentage than for any other security device.

**From which security device are you currently seeing the least value in your security program in terms of initial investment, time expenditure, and operating cost? (select one)**
- AI Device: 18%
- Firewall: 7%
- Cloud Monitoring tools: 6%
- Endpoint Tool (EDR, EPP, NGAV, AV): 15%
- Network Monitor, Traffic Analyzer: 15%
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): 14%
- SIEM: 13%
- SOAR: 12%

One reason for this comparatively lesser value is that AI devices still have an accuracy problem — nearly a quarter (24%) of respondents indicated that their AI appliances provided the highest amount of noise and false positives compared to true positive alerts, second only to network monitors and appliances (27%).

**Getting from promise to practical may take a while**

There’s a difference between integrating AI into a proven solution compared to essentially making AI the solution itself.

In the former scenario, AI capabilities exist within and augment the broader set of people, processes, and technologies that combine to safeguard an organization; in the latter scenario — as is the case with AI devices being marketed today — entire security functions may be handed off to an AI engine.

Unfortunately, while AI devices are great during demonstrations, they tend to underperform in the real world. This discrepancy is at least somewhat due to impractically high false positive rates.

And even with today’s technology, it remains much harder to improve an AI system’s accuracy from 98% to 99.9% than it is to go from 85% to 90%. Crucially, though, that 1.9 percentage point increase reduces mistakes by a factor of 20, compared to only a one-third reduction for the 5 percentage point increase.

Accordingly, it will likely be a long time before the accuracy improves enough to put more trust in these devices. As historical context, it’s taken roughly 25 years for credit card fraud detection to improve from about 80% accuracy in the late 1990s to today’s extremely high level (approaching 99.9%).

For at least the next few years, the best cybersecurity outcomes will almost certainly use solutions that integrate AI to improve existing functions, versus handing the keys to AI devices.

> It remains much harder to improve an AI system’s accuracy from 98% to 99.9% than it is to go from 85% to 90%.

# SECTION 3

## Readiness Trends

### Trend 1: Data Transformation and Secure AI Adoption Are Driving Heavy Cybersecurity Investments

A strong majority of respondents (84%) reported that their organization is investing heavily in its cybersecurity program, leaving only 16% admitting limited investments.

**How would you classify your current cybersecurity investment? (select one)**
- We invest heavily in our security program: 84%
- We invest limitedly in our security program: 16%

Consistent with the earlier finding that AI is the primary area of concern for security leaders, the most frequently cited driver of cybersecurity investments was “data transformation and AI adoption,” which was selected by 45% of survey respondents. In fact, there was a clear gap between the frontrunner and the next two major drivers, “intellectual property protection / privacy / data protection” (37%) and “risk management” (36%).

**What do you feel are the primary drivers of your cybersecurity strategy for the next 12 months? (select up to three)**
- Data transformation and secure AI adoption: 45%
- Intellectual property protection / privacy / data protection: 37%
- Risk management: 36%
- Increased cyber insurance costs or loss of policy: 32%
- Building a culture of security awareness:
