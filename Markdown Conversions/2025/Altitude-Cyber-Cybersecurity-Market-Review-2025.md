### Panther Labs Acquires Datable

Altitude Cyber Served As Exclusive Strategic Advisor To Panther Labs.

Panther Labs announced the acquisition of Datable, a security telemetry pipeline innovator, in a strategic move that accelerates
its ability to deliver a unified AI SOC platform capable of automating threat detection and response at enterprise scale.

The acquisition brings Datable founder and CEO Julian Giuca to Panther's executive leadership team, where his nearly two
decades of experience in observability and log management will drive two critical initiatives: reinforcing Panther's market-leading
position in real-time security monitoring for high-scale environments and accelerating AI functionality across the platform to help
customers dramatically reduce costs and response times.

By combining Datable's telemetry pipeline expertise with Panther's proven data processing capabilities, customers gain enhanced
workflows for transformation, filtering, and analysis that extract critical insights in real-time from their security telemetry. This
strengthened foundation enables organizations to deploy production-ready AI capabilities that deliver measurable security
outcomes—faster threat detection, lower operational costs, and broader visibility across complex environments.

"Panther is trusted by hundreds of security teams to monitor their most critical systems and environments, largely due to our
unique capabilities in high-volume security log ingestion, transformation, and analysis," said William Lowe, Panther CEO. "By
bringing Julian and the Datable team onboard, we're accelerating delivery of a complete AI SOC platform for our customers—
merging our core data strengths with cutting-edge workflow design and data quality capabilities. These enhancements help
security teams separate signal from noise and build robust security data lakes that power efficient, reliable AI-driven outcomes.
The evidence is clear: customers are onboarding data faster, significantly reducing costs, and accelerating threat response across
complex hybrid environments."

"Security operations today face a fundamental challenge: creating the clean, reliable data pipelines needed to automate security
outcomes while controlling costs," said Julian Giuca, Datable founder and CEO. "By joining Panther, I'm excited to advance a
platform that's already proven its ability to handle massive scale while delivering concrete business value—whether that's cutting
costs, accelerating threat response, or expanding visibility. Together, we'll ensure organizations can leverage their security
telemetry as the foundation for a complete AI SOC that delivers results, not just promises."

### Verosint Acquired By Imprivata

Altitude Cyber Served As Exclusive Strategic Advisor To Verosint.

Imprivata, a leading provider of access management solutions for healthcare and other mission-critical industries, today
announced the acquisition of Verosint, a leader in Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) solutions. The acquisition
represents Imprivata’s latest strategic investment in modernizing enterprise access management with solutions that deliver
advanced, frictionless, and passwordless access for every user type, including frontline staff, knowledge workers, and third-
party identities, while strengthening security, streamlining compliance, and reducing total cost of ownership.

“Understanding risk is an essential component of a modern access management solution, and this acquisition allows us to
deliver greater value to our customers at a faster pace. We plan to integrate Verosint’s AI-powered risk engine into our
platform to support our broader vision for delivering a comprehensive advanced and passwordless access platform,” said
Fran Rosch, CEO of Imprivata. “Imprivata has delivered the industry’s first passwordless, zero-trust solution for shared
device access, purpose-built for frontline workers. By integrating Verosint’s capabilities, our platform continuously validates
that access is appropriate and authorized. Combined with other enhancements, Imprivata unifies enterprise access into a
single platform that boosts productivity, strengthens security, and reduces costs.”

“Our mission at Verosint has been to help organizations stop identity-based attacks before they cause damage,” said Steve
Shoaff, CEO of Verosint. “Joining forces with Imprivata allows us to expand the impact of our technology at enterprise scale,
while contributing to a future where access is not only secure, but also effortless for users.”

“Enterprises are looking for ways to improve security without slowing down their workforce,” said Chip Hughes, Chief
Product Officer at Imprivata. “Our vision for advanced and passwordless access is about delivering strong authentication
behind the scenes, with the intelligence and automation needed to adapt to risk in real time. The integration of Verosint will
be a critical step in making that vision a reality, and we look forward to adding risk signaling int our solution set to help
customers solve their complex workflow, security, and compliance challenges.”

### Netography Acquired By Vectra

Altitude Cyber Served As Exclusive Strategic Advisor To Netography.

Vectra AI, the cybersecurity AI company that protects modern networks from modern attacks, announced the acquisition of
Netography, a pioneer in cloud-native network observability. The acquisition strengthens the Vectra AI Platform's ability to
deliver unmatched protection for hybrid and multi-cloud enterprises. As part of the acquisition, Netography Fusion will join the
Vectra AI portfolio as Vectra Fusion, delivering agentless, cloud-native observability to enable proactive, preemptive cyber-
attack defense for hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

Netography's Software-Defined Observability brings seamless orchestration of VPC flow logs, automated onboarding of new
accounts and workloads, and uniform visibility across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises environments. By integrating these
capabilities, Vectra AI not only extends its native coverage of the hybrid enterprise but also enriches the accuracy of its attack
signal clarity with context from cloud control planes and data planes. The result is a uniform, frictionless SOC platform for the
modern hybrid enterprise.

"Enterprises will be hybrid forever," says Hitesh Sheth, CEO of Vectra AI, "and only AI can deliver the signal at the speed and
scale required to defend them. Network-derived signal is the ultimate source of truth, not only for detecting active threats but
also for managing overall exposure. With Netography, we add the breadth of cloud-native observability to Vectra AI's depth of
attack signal clarity. The outcome is one converged platform that gives security teams the power to proactively and reactively
protect hybrid enterprises with unmatched speed and precision.“

Martin Roesch, CEO of Netography echoes Hitesh's comments, "For years, we've argued that observability must be cloud-
native, software-defined, and frictionless because visibility without scale is an illusion. With Vectra AI, that observability
becomes truly actionable. Our combined platform gives defenders uniform visibility, context, and control across any
environment, finally matching the speed and agility of modern attackers."

With Netography now part of the Vectra AI Platform, organizations gain the best of both worlds: the breadth of frictionless,
cloud-native observability and the depth of AI-driven attack signal clarity. Together, the companies set a new standard for
converged detection, investigation and response at enterprise speed and scale — giving defenders the power to eliminate blind
spots, cut through noise, and stop modern attacks on modern hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

#### Shift Toward Profitability &
Sustainable Growth

Most investors are prioritizing efficiency over hypergrowth in the current climate. Companies with strong
business fundamentals are commanding higher valuations.

#### Security Market Enters The
Disciplined Growth / AI-Era

Following a market correction from mid-2022 through early-2024 coinciding with lower median deal sizes,
lighter strategic activity, and heavier investment scrutiny, median deal values have begun to recover, along
with investments, highly strategic acquisitions, and disciplined growth in an AI-enabled market.

#### Netskope Enters The Public Arena

Netskope IPO’ed on September 18th, raising $908M in net proceeds with an initial price of $19 per share.

## IV. RSAC Innovation Showcase

### RSAC Innovation Showcase
Showcase Takes Place Virtually On November 19th, 2025.

Join RSAC Conference, Altitude Cyber, Bright Security, and
OX Security for the November 2025 edition of RSAC ’s
Innovation Showcase, taking place on November 19th at
1pm EST.

RSAC ’s monthly virtual program provides a platform for
expert-led panels and startups from around the world to
showcase the industry’s latest technology and solutions.

#### Innovation Showcase Overview

##### Coding with AI:
Can We Trust the Code We
Ship?

Can AI truly help us write secure code — or is it just making it easier to ship vulnerabilities
faster? Join us as we dive into the challenges of securing AI-generated code and the rise of
autonomous testing and remediation. Featuring insights and case studies from AppSec
innovators.

###### Identifying The Problem

Modern enterprises ship code at unprecedented speed — APIs, microservices, web apps, now
even leveraging AI-generated code. Traditional static/dynamic scanners create alert fatigue
without offering fixes. What enterprises want is autonomous, continuous testing with real
solutions — security that keeps up with the speed of modern software delivery.

A panel of experts will discuss:

- How AI is transforming the way developers write and ship code — and where it introduces
  new classes of vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure code patterns, prompt injection)
- What visibility and validation guardrails are needed before trusting AI-generated output in
  production
- What successful AI-era AppSec looks like: continuous validation, contextual fixes, and
  collaboration between dev, sec, and AI systems

Each Showcase will last approximately 30 minutes and will
include:

- Expert Panel Discussion
- Five-minute pitches from two up and coming startups
- Panel feedback for each startup

  Upcoming RSAC Showcase

### Bright Security | Case Studies

Bright Security GenAI Case Study.

#### Case Study: GenAI Application Security

Organizations adopting LLM-based code generation solutions face a key barrier: the code often promotes speed but sometimes at the cost of security. This creates risks for
customers, slows adoption, and ultimately hinders revenue growth.

Bright Security tested the security of applications built by four GenAI platforms, Lovable, Replit, Anthropic & Base44 to gauge the security of AI code generation platforms.

##### Vulnerabilities
Found:

- Lovable: 11 security flaws baked directly into the code
  - 4 Critical
  - 1 High
  - 5 Low
  - 1 Medium
  Lovable was able to generate a full-stack app, but
  while speed is exciting, security isn’t included.
  AI-built apps might be faster to deploy, but they
  won’t be safer by default.

- Replit: 18 security flaws baked directly into the code
  - 4 Critical
  - 1 High
  - 13 Low
  Replit’s built-in scanner (powered by Semgrep)
  reported “No vulnerabilities found.”
  But the real problem is bigger: Replit’s app itself
  was insecure by design.

- Anthropic: 10 security flaws baked directly into the code
  - 4 Critical
  - 0 High
  - 6 Low
  While Claude’s app looked more secure than others
  Bright tested, that was due to the application having
  less functionality. Fewer implemented features does
  not necessarily mean better security.

- Base44: 22 security flaws baked directly into the code
  - 4 Critical
  - 3 High
  - 14 Low
  - 1 Medium
  While Base44 highlighted false positives, the real
  vulnerabilities were doing damage underneath. AI
  platforms can now generate full apps & misdiagnose
  their own security.

#### Delivering a Solution:

Bright integrates seamlessly with AI code generation solutions to select and run security unit tests, find exploitable vulnerabilities in apps and APIs, guide the LLM to generate
secure fixes, and dynamically validate that those fixes worked. This builds confidence in AI-generated code and accelerates customer adoption and deployment.

### OX Security | Case Studies

OX Security Case Studies.

#### Case Study: eBlu Solutions

eBlu Solutions faced significant delays due to manual security processes, slowing innovation.
Reliance on these manual processes were labor-intensive, prone to delays, and lacked real-time
visibility into vulnerabilities.

##### Challenges

- eBlu Solutions, a leader in healthcare
  management, struggled with manual security
  processes, leading to significant delays and
  limited visibility
- This inefficiency in security hindered eBlu’s
  ability to address vulnerabilities in real time,
  slowing their path to innovation and data
  protection

##### Results

- By implementing OX Security’s Active ASPM
  platform, eBlu gained real-time visibility and
  reduced false positives
- OX’s automation and contextual
  prioritization helped the team quickly focus
  on vulnerabilities that mattered, eliminating
  manual tasks and ensuring faster
  remediation

#### Delivering a Solution:

OX Security transformed eBlu’s security operations, enabling rapid, efficient
development while maintaining robust data protection. Improvements included a
70% reduction in manual effort from eBlu’s team, faster vulnerability resolution,
reducing remediation from weeks to hours, and improved security posture,
allowing eBlu to address high-impact issues quickly.

#### Case Study: DoubleVerify

DoubleVerify struggled with fragmented security tools that required manual effort to track
vulnerabilities, leading to inefficiencies and a higher risk of missing critical issues.

##### Challenges

- DoubleVerify’s fragmented security tools
  were causing inefficiencies, relying on a mix
  of enterprise and open-source vulnerability
  scanners, each providing its own siloed
  insights
- Furthermore, as a result of this scattered
  approach, DoubleVerify’s teams had
  difficulty in prioritizing critical vulnerabilities

##### Results

- OX Security provided an application-first
  approach to security, as their active ASPM
  platform offered DoubleVerify a centralized
  view specifically designed around
  applications and repositories
- The OX platform streamlined operations by
  consolidating, normalizing, and correlating
  security data into one accessible platform

#### Delivering a Solution:

OX Security’s platform provided DoubleVerify with measurable improvements
across several areas. The OX platform improved unified security management by
successfully consolidating security data from multiple tools, offered increased
accessibility for non-security professionals, and streamlined vulnerability
management, allowing DoubleVerify to respond proactively to threats.
