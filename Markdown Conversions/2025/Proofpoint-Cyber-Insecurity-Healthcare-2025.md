## Part 1. Executive Summary

### The 2025 Study on Cyber Insecurity in Healthcare
This fourth annual report was conducted to determine the healthcare industry’s effectiveness in reducing human-targeted cybersecurity risks and disruptions to patient care. With sponsorship from Proofpoint, Ponemon Institute surveyed 677 IT and IT security practitioners in U.S. healthcare organizations who are responsible for participating in such cybersecurity strategies as setting IT cybersecurity priorities, managing budgets and selecting vendors and contractors.

**Healthcare organizations remain frequent targets, with cyberattacks continuing to disrupt patient care**
According to the research, **93 percent** of organizations surveyed experienced at least one cyberattack in the past 12 months. For organizations in that group, the average number of cyberattacks was **43**, a 3-point increase from 40 in 2024.

The cyberattacks analyzed that took place over a two-year period in this research are cloud/account compromises, supply chain attacks, ransomware and business email compromise (BEC)/spoofing/impersonation. Among the organizations that experienced the four types of cyberattacks, an average of **72 percent** report disruption to patient care, a 3-point jump from 69 percent in 2024.

**While the cost of cyberattacks has declined, they remain a significant financial burden**
We asked respondents to estimate the single most expensive cyberattack experienced in the past 12 months from a range of less than $10,000 to more than $25 million. Based on the responses, the average total cost for the most expensive cyberattack was **$3.9 million**, down from $4.7 million in 2024 but still substantial. This includes all direct cash outlays, direct labor expenditures, indirect labor costs, overhead costs and lost business opportunities.

This year’s study finds that healthcare organizations’ ability to protect confidential patient data and ensure the highest quality of medical care is increasingly at risk, underscoring the need for a more human-centric security approach.

- **93%** of organizations experienced an average of 43 cyberattacks in the past 12 months.
- **72%** reported disruption to patient care.
- **$3.9M** is the average total cost for the single most expensive cyberattack experienced over the past 12 months.

For the first time, this year’s study examined plans to secure clinical operations in the cloud. **Thirty percent** of respondents say their organizations have moved clinical applications to the cloud. **Forty-five percent** say their organizations will move clinical applications to the cloud in the next six months (9 percent), within the next year (8 percent), in the next one to two years (15 percent) or eventually (13 percent).

#### Cybersecurity Cost Categories
Operational disruptions stemming from system availability problems remain the most expensive consequence. The following is a breakdown of the five cybersecurity cost categories for the single most expensive cyberattack:

1.  **Disruption to normal healthcare operations**: Cost an average of $1,210,172 (decreased from $1,469,524 in 2024).
2.  **Users’ idle time and lost productivity**: Dropped to $858,832 from $995,484 in 2024.
3.  **Time required to ensure the impact on patient care is corrected**: Decreased to $702,680 from $853,272 in 2024.
4.  **Damage or theft of IT assets and infrastructure**: Averaged $624,605, down slightly from $711,060 in 2024.
5.  **Remediation and technical support activities**: Saw the largest drop (28.6%) from $711,060 in 2024 to $507,491 in 2025.

## Part 2. Key Findings

### Cybersecurity Threats in Healthcare

**Cloud/account compromise**
For the fourth consecutive year, frequent attacks against the cloud make it the top cybersecurity threat. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (64 percent) say their organizations are vulnerable or highly vulnerable to a cloud/account compromise. **Seventy-two percent** say their organizations have experienced cloud/account compromises, an increase from 69 percent in 2024. These organizations had an average of 21 such compromises in the past two years.

**Supply chain attacks**
Fewer organizations are experiencing supply chain attacks. **Forty-four percent** of respondents say their organizations experienced an attack against its supply chains, a significant decline from 68 percent in 2024. Fifty-seven percent say their organizations are very or highly vulnerable to supply chain attacks.

**Ransomware**
Fewer organizations are paying a ransom, but the amount paid has increased. The costliest ransom paid (extrapolated value) was **$1.2 million**, up from $1.1 million in 2024—a 60 percent increase from 2022. Fifty-five percent of respondents believe their organizations are vulnerable to ransomware.

**Business email compromise (BEC)/spoofing/impersonation**
Concerns about these attacks have decreased since 2022. **Fifty-three percent** say their organizations are vulnerable to a BEC incident. **Sixty-two percent** say their organizations experienced an average of four attacks in the past two years.

### The Impact of Cyberattacks on Patient Care

Among organizations that experienced the four types of cyberattacks, an average of **72 percent** report disruption to patient care.

## Part 4. Caveats to this report

1.  **Non-response bias**: The current findings are based on a sample of survey returns. It is possible that individuals who did not participate are substantially different from those who completed the instrument.
2.  **Sampling-frame bias**: Accuracy is based on contact information and the degree to which the list is representative. Results may be biased by external events such as media coverage.
3.  **Self-reported results**: The quality of research is based on the integrity of confidential responses. There is always the possibility that a subject did not provide accurate responses.
