This TAG Analyst Report features the TAG Top Five vendor
BigID in the area of Data Discovery and Classification for 2025
based on TAG’s evaluation criteria.

BigID specializes in Data Discovery and Classification through its advanced,
AI-driven platform, which automates the process of identifying sensitive and
regulated data across structured and unstructured data sources. BigID’s
platform provides extensive metadata tagging, categorization, and data
mapping capabilities, helping organizations understand what types of data
they hold and where it is located. BigID’s solution is particularly strong in
supporting compliance requirements, offering granular data classification
that aligns with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA, making it a powerful
tool for organizations prioritizing data privacy and security.

## Introduction

Data discovery and classification are foundational processes in data security and governance,
designed to help organizations identify, catalog, and categorize their data assets. With data residing
across multiple environments—on-premises, cloud, and hybrid—having visibility into where sensitive
data resides is crucial. Data discovery tools scan and map data assets across various storage
systems, identifying data sources that may contain critical or sensitive information. This visibility allows
organizations to know what data they hold, where it is stored, and whether it complies with internal and
regulatory standards.

Once discovered, data classification comes into play by categorizing data based on sensitivity, risk,
or business value. Classification typically involves assigning labels to data such as “confidential,”
“public,” “restricted,” or “regulated,” making it easier to apply appropriate security controls. For example,
financial data, personally identifiable information (PII), and intellectual property may be labeled as high
sensitivity, requiring stronger protection measures. Classification is often automated using machine
learning and pattern recognition, allowing large volumes of data to be categorized efficiently.

Data discovery and classification also enhance regulatory compliance by helping organizations identify
and protect regulated data in line with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. These regulations require
organizations to know where sensitive data is stored and who has access to it, and to implement
adequate protection measures. By discovering and classifying data, organizations can identify
compliance-related data, enforce access controls, and generate reports to demonstrate compliance.

Beyond security and compliance, data discovery and classification support better data management.
When organizations know what data they have and how it is classified, they can make more informed
decisions on data storage, retention, and usage. For example, data that is deemed low-sensitivity or
redundant can be archived or deleted, freeing up storage space and reducing infrastructure costs.
Classification also facilitates efficient data sharing within the organization by ensuring that employees
can access only the data they need for their roles.

Finally, data discovery and classification play a critical role in reducing the risk of data breaches and
insider threats. By knowing where sensitive data resides and who has access to it, organizations can
implement more targeted access controls and monitor usage patterns for potential anomalies. In
the event of an attack, having pre-classified data allows for a faster and more effective response, as
security teams can focus on high-risk areas first.

## Evaluation Criteria

The process for calculating a TAG Navigator to determine the aggregate CVR for a cybersecurity vendor
involves ten factors. How these factors are used has evolved and is now associated with a common,
normalized interpretation and scoring that is being used in various sectors including cyber insurance as
a basis for reviewing the effectiveness of a vendor in reducing the cyber risk of buyers. The ten factors
are as follows:

1.  **Company Stage**: This references where a given vendor currently resides in the corporate lifecycle.
    At one end of the scale are the start-ups driven by founding teams. Mature public companies with
    experienced management are at the other end of the scale.
2.  **Message Efficacy**: This involves the vendor’s marketing and value proposition message. At one end
    of the spectrum is an unclear description focused mostly on features. At the other end is a strong
    message of what solution is being addressed and why.
3.  **Pace of Innovation**: This involves how rapidly the vendor is innovating. At one end of the scale are
    the vendors innovating at an impressive pace. At the other end of the scale are companies who slow
    innovation in favor of scale.
4.  **Vision and Strategy**: This addresses whether the vendor articulates their role and purpose. At one
    end of the scale are vendors developing a future vision. At the other end of the scale are vendors who
    describe a clear vision and strategy for their company.
5.  **Strength of Management**: This references whether a strong management team exists. At one end
    of the spectrum are companies with new managers in their first leadership roles. At the other end are
    companies with a mature, experienced leadership team.
6.  **Strength of References**: This involves the references who can vouch for a vendor. At one end of
    the scale are new vendors with virtually zero customers and at the other end, we find vendors with
    massive global customer bases.
7.  **Financial Strength**: This addresses the company’s funding, revenue, and profitability. At one end of
    the spectrum are companies with weak near-term financial prospects. At the other end are well-
    funded or public companies with growing revenue and profits.
8.  **Ability to Scale**: This addresses whether the solution can be provided to a large base. At one end of
    the spectrum are companies that struggle to support new customers. At the other end are companies
    with a platform that can handle rapid growth.
9.  **Product Functionality**: This references whether the solution addresses the needs of its customers.
    At one end of the spectrum are companies with a prototype. At the other end are companies with a
    working solution that is thoroughly used and supported.
10. **Infrastructure Maturity**: This references whether the company is sufficiently protecting user data
    and ensuring proper support for customer security. New vendors are usually challenged in this area
    and often do not have security teams in place.
