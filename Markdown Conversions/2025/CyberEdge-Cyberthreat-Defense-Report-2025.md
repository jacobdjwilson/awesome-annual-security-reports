## Introduction

CyberEdge’s annual Cyberthreat Defense Report (CDR) plays a unique role in the IT security industry. Other surveys do a great job of collecting statistics on cyberattacks and data breaches and exploring the techniques of cybercriminals and other bad actors. Our mission is to provide deep insight into the minds of IT security professionals.

More than a decade after its first edition, the CDR has become a staple among IT security leaders and practitioners by helping them gauge their internal practices and security investments according to those of their counterparts across multiple countries and industries. If you want to know what your peers in IT security are thinking and doing, this is the place to look.

CyberEdge would like to thank our Silver, Gold, and Platinum research sponsors, whose continued support is essential to the success of this report.

### Top Five Insights for 2025

Our CDR reports yield dozens of actionable insights. Here are the top five takeaways from this year’s installment:

1.  **Have we turned the corner?** The percentage of organizations experiencing at least one successful cyberattack trended upward from our 2016 CDR to the 2021 edition. So did the percentage suffering from six or more. And so did the percentage of organizations that expected to be compromised at least once in the coming year. But those three metrics essentially plateaued between 2021 and 2023 and then dropped to a lower plateau in the 2024 report and this one. It’s too early to let our guard down, but it does seem like the factors working in favor of cybersecurity teams (like large investments in cloud security during the COVID pandemic, the application of zero trust principles, a renewed interest in cybersecurity basics, and AI embedded in security products) are now matching or even outpacing the factors working for threat actors.

2.  **AI Is Coming Up Everywhere.** Our survey has one question specifically about AI, asking respondents about the strength of their preference for purchasing security products that feature AI technologies (see page 37). But AI comes up in many places in this report: as a force helping cybersecurity teams in their work (page 8), as a factor helping threat actors (page 17), as a tool to detect fraud and foil web application and mobile attacks (page 19), as a tool to filter out false positive alerts (page 24), as a technology embedded in secure email gateways to flag abnormal behaviors (page 42), and as the driver of a long-term arms race between threat actors and cybersecurity teams (page 57). In many ways, this dynamic mirrors how enterprises are starting to benefit from AI: not by acquiring “AI products,” but by leveraging AI capabilities embedded in security solutions and platforms.

3.  **Twists and Turns for Ransomware.** It’s hard to summarize the changing dynamics of ransomware this year. After rising for a decade, the percentage of organizations affected by ransomware fell for the second year in a row (good news J), but average ransom demands have continued to rise (bad news L). The percentage of victimized organizations that paid ransoms fell (probably good news J), but the percentage of ransom payers who recovered their data fell (bad news L). If you want to know the factors we think are behind these gyrations, see pages 20-22.

4.  **The Never-ending Skills Shortage.** The lack of experienced cybersecurity personnel has been a running theme in CDRs for years. In this report, it comes up in a tie for first among factors inhibiting organizations from adequately defending themselves against cyberthreats (page 23) and as the biggest challenge for attack surface management (ASM) (page 25). Also, it turns out there is a huge demand worldwide for entry-level security fundamentals courses and certifications (see page 30), most likely because organizations that can’t find enough experienced cybersecurity professionals in the marketplace are trying to train their own. While this shortage can be a big headache for cybersecurity managers, it also has a significant benefit: it provides incentives for adding more automation and autonomous decision-making capabilities to security products. In time, these will improve security and reduce the gap between cybersecurity jobs and the people who can perform them.

5.  **Frameworks Are in Favor, Big Time.** A few years ago, many cybersecurity professionals derided cybersecurity frameworks and standards as incomplete and perpetually lagging real-world requirements. But that has changed. We found that 97% of organizations use at least one framework or standard to assess the effectiveness and compliance of their cybersecurity program. Which frameworks and standards from organizations such as the Cloud Security Alliance, NIST, the Center for Internet Security, and ISO are preferred? Find out on pages 49 and 50.

### About This Report

The CDR is the most geographically comprehensive, vendor-agnostic study of IT security decision makers and practitioners. Rather than compiling cyberthreat statistics and assessing the damage caused by data breaches, the CDR surveys the perceptions of IT security professionals, gaining insights into how they see the world.

Specifically, the CDR examines:

*   The frequency of successful cyberattacks in the prior year and optimism (or pessimism) about preventing further attacks in the coming year.
*   The perceived impact of cyberthreats and the challenges organizations face in mitigating their risks.
*   The adequacy of organizations’ security postures and their internal security practices.
*   The organizational factors that present the most significant barriers to establishing effective cyberthreat defenses.
*   Current investments in security technologies and those planned for the coming year.
*   The health of IT security budgets and the portion of the overall IT budget they consume.

By revealing these details, we hope to help IT security decision makers and practitioners gain a better understanding of how their perceptions, concerns, priorities, and defenses stack up against those of their peers around the world. IT security teams can use the CDR’s data, analyses, and findings to shape answers to many important questions, such as:

*   Where do we have gaps in our cyberthreat defenses relative to other organizations?
*   Have we fallen behind in our defensive strategy to the point that our organization is now the “low-hanging fruit” (i.e., likely to be targeted more often due to its relative weaknesses)?
*   Are we on track with both our approach and progress in continuing to address traditional areas of concern while tackling the challenges of emerging threats?
*   How does our level of spending on IT security compare to that of other organizations?
*   Do other IT security practitioners think differently about cyberthreats and their defenses, and should we adjust our perspective and plans to account for these differences?

Another important objective of the CDR is to provide developers of IT security technologies and services with information they can use to better align their solutions with the concerns and requirements of potential customers. Our data can lead to better market traction and success for solution providers, along with better cyberthreat protection technologies for our resolute security professionals.

The findings of the CDR are divided into four sections:

#### Section 1: Current Security Posture

Our journey into the world of cyberthreat defenses begins with respondents’ assessments of the effectiveness of their organization’s investments and strategies relative to the prevailing threat landscape. They report on the frequency of successful cyberattacks, judge their organization’s security posture in specific IT domains and security functions, and provide details on the IT security skills shortage. The data will help readers begin to assess:

*   Whether, to what extent, and how urgently changes are needed in their own organization.
*   Specific countermeasures that should be added to supplement existing defenses.

#### Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns

In this section, our exploration of cyberthreat defenses shifts from establishing baseline security postures to determining the types of cyberthreats and obstacles to security that most concern today’s organizations. The survey respondents weigh in on the most alarming cyberthreats, barriers to establishing effective defenses, and high-profile issues such as ransomware and security for hybrid cloud environments. These appraisals will help readers think about how their own organization can best improve cyberthreat defenses going forward. We also look at how IT security training and professional certification can help enterprises address the serious shortfall in skilled IT security staff.

#### Section 3: Current and Future Investments

Organizations can ill afford to stand still when it comes to maintaining effective cyberthreat defenses. IT security teams must keep pace with changes occurring in business, technology, and threat landscapes. This section of the survey provides data on the direction of IT security budgets, and on current and planned investments in network security, endpoint security, application and data security, and security management and operations. Readers will be able to compare their organization’s investment decisions against the broad sample and get a sense of what “hot” technologies their peers are deploying.

#### Section 4: Practices and Strategies

Mitigating today’s cyberthreat risks takes more than investing in the right technologies. You must ensure those technologies are deployed optimally, configured correctly, and monitored adequately to give your organization a fighting chance to avoid being a front-page news story. In the final section of the survey, our respondents provide information on how they are deploying and using leading-edge technologies and services.

## Research Highlights

### Current Security Posture

*   **Over the hump**: The percentage of organizations experiencing a successful attack stayed a few notches below the recent peak (page 7).
*   **A brighter future**: Expectations of future compromises fell for the fourth straight year (page 10).
*   **Mobile devices least safe**: Among IT domains, cybersecurity teams are the least comfortable about the security posture of mobile devices (page 12).
*   **Doubts about defenses**: Confidence in IT security capabilities slipped in 11 of 12 functional areas (page 14).

### Perceptions and Concerns

*   **The not-so-fabulous four**: Respondents are most concerned about malware, phishing, ransomware, and account takeovers – again (page 16).
*   **Everyone’s exposed on the web**: Every major industry suffers from attacks against web and mobile applications (page 18).
*   **Fewer firms paying ransoms**: The number of organizations victimized by ransomware that pay the ransom has fallen 22% over three years (page 20).
*   **To err is human**: Low security awareness among employees and lack of skilled security personnel continue to undermine cybersecurity efforts (page 23).
*   **Surfaces count**: Cybersecurity teams are paying attention to the concept of attack surfaces but must work hard to protect them (page 25).
*   **Cloud complexity**: Organizations are struggling to cope with the challenges of defending hybrid multi-cloud environments (page 27).

*   **In zero trust we trust**: 86% of organizations believe that implementing zero trust network access (ZTNA) has improved their ability to defend against sophisticated threats (page 51).
*   **What boards need to know**: Assessments of cybersecurity program maturity or effectiveness lead the list of information cybersecurity groups are presenting to their organization’s board of directors (page 53).
*   **New stars rising**: We updated our list of emerging IT security technologies and architectures being embraced by cybersecurity teams (page 55).

## Section 1: Current Security Posture

### Past Frequency of Successful Cyberattacks

**How many times do you estimate that your organization’s global network has been compromised by a successful cyberattack within the past 12 months?**

The bleeding has stopped; we’ve stabilized at partly cloudy. Although we can’t yet see the light at the end of the tunnel, at least it’s not getting any darker.

We haven’t found exactly the right metaphor (obviously), but if you look at Figure 1, you will get the idea.

Of the 1,200 organizations responding to our survey each year, the percentage compromised at least once by a successful cyberattack in the previous 12 months climbed fairly steadily from 75.6% in the 2016 CDR to 86.2% in 2021, plateaued for the next two surveys, then dropped to a lower plateau of 81.5% in 2024 and 81.6% this year.

The pattern for the percentage of organizations experiencing six or more successful attacks (the red bars in Figure 1) was roughly the same. It climbed from 2016 to 2021, flattening out for two years, then dropping to a significantly lower plateau for the past two reports.

Figure 2 shows a breakdown of the frequency of successful attacks for this year: just over half of organizations (53.0%) experienced between one and five, 20.8% suffered between six and 10, an unfortunate 7.9% were afflicted by more than 10, and a lucky 18.4% reported none.

However, we can’t say the patient is in perfect health, the sun is shining brightly, or we have emerged from the tunnel. The number of organizations being hit by cyberattacks is still at a high level, and with new threats emerging continuously, including those using AI, this is no time for cybersecurity professionals to let down our guard. But at least we can say that we have held the line, stanched the flood, turned the corner… okay, okay, no more metaphors.

![Figure 1: Percentage of organizations experiencing at least one successful attack and those experiencing six or more.](placeholder_image_description)

![Figure 2: Frequency of successful cyberattacks in the past 12 months.](placeholder_image_description)

What factors and trends account for the pattern shown in Figure 1?
Negative factors from 2016 to 2021 included:

*   Increasingly sophisticated attacks from cybercriminals and state-sponsored hackers.
*   Additional incentives for cybercrime driven by the development of new ways to monetize data breaches.
*   The growth of marketplaces and ecosystems on the dark web that allow threat actors to specialize, share techniques and tools, sell and rent infrastructure to each other, and create ever-larger virtual organizations.

All these were capped by the COVID pandemic, which increased attack surfaces by pushing work out to poorly protected remote locations and homes.

Trends helping cybersecurity teams regain control after 2021 include:

*   Remote workers returning to offices.
*   Benefits from the large investments in network and cloud security tools made in response to the challenges of COVID, as well as investments in the advanced technologies discussed on page 55.
*   The widening application of best practices encouraged by zero trust principles and mandated by frameworks from standards bodies and government agencies.
*   More attention to cybersecurity basics, including security hygiene, identity management, security awareness training for users, and training for cybersecurity professionals.
*   AI capabilities embedded in security products and services.

There are some interesting variations by country and by organization size in the data on successful attacks.

For example, job stress is probably highest in the four countries where at least nine of 10 organizations experienced a successful attack in the past year: Colombia (96.9%), Turkey (93.9%), South Africa (93.7%), and Mexico (90.6%). Stress levels are probably a little lower in the five countries where the successful attack rate is under 80%: Australia (78.7%), Germany (77.5%), the United States (74.8%), Italy (72.0%), and Canada (71.7%) (see Figure 3).

![Figure 3: Percentage of organizations compromised by at least one successful attack in the past 12 months, by country.](placeholder_image_description)

Looking at size (Figure 4), there is a steady increase in successful attack percentages in organizations from the smallest represented in our survey (500-999 employees) to the second-largest category (10,000-24,999 employees). However, the rate then drops significantly when we get to the largest organizations, with at least 25,000 employees. This pattern probably reflects the fact that, although as firms get larger and offer more-lucrative targets to attackers, the very largest global organizations have the most cybersecurity specialists and invest in the most state-of-the-art defenses.

What does the future hold? We are cautiously optimistic that the slow improvements since 2021 can be maintained, provided cybersecurity teams, vendors, and standards bodies keep up their current levels of effort.

“We can’t say the patient is in perfect health, the sun is shining brightly, or we have emerged from the tunnel... but at least we can say that we have held the line, stanched the flood, turned the corner…okay, okay, no more metaphors.”

![Figure 4: Percentage of organizations compromised by at least one successful attack in the past 12 months, by number of employees.](placeholder_image_description)

### Future Likelihood of Successful Cyberattacks

**What is the likelihood that your organization’s network will become compromised by a successful cyberattack in 2025?**

In the previous section, we asked our respondents to report on successful cyberattacks in the past year. In this section, we ask about the likelihood of one or more successful attacks occurring in the current year.

The pattern is roughly the same: rising, leveling out, then falling back a bit. Specifically, the percentage predicting a successful attack in the coming 12 months increased from 62.1% in 2016 to 76.1% in the 2022 CDR and has since fallen in steps to 64.0% (see Figure 5).

In fact, the percentage saying that a successful attack is “very likely” in the coming year has fallen to the lowest level since 2018 (see the red bars in Figure 5).

Clearly, the reduction in the rate of successful attacks in past years is leading our respondents to expect further reductions in the coming year. In fact, we might say that their optimism is growing even faster than their experience. Between the 2023 CDR and the current 2025 report, the percentage of organizations experiencing at least one successful cyberattack in the past year fell 3.1% (from 84.7% to 81.6%), while those saying that it’s somewhat or very likely that they would be attacked successfully in the coming year fell 7.8% (from 71.8% to 64.0%).

You may also have noticed that our respondents are optimistic in another way. If 81.6% of organizations experienced at least one compromise last year (Figure 1), as a group they might be a tad overconfident in predicting that only 64.0% will be compromised this year (Figure 5). But that’s okay; we wouldn’t want to rain on their parade. (Oops, another metaphor. Sorry!)

![Figure 5: Percentage of organizations indicating that compromise by a successful cyberattack in 2025 is somewhat or very likely.](placeholder_image_description)

One interesting detail from the comparison by country (Figure 6) is that the six countries with the highest predictions for successful attacks include the four Asia-Pacific nations in our survey: Japan (85.5%), China (82.0%), Singapore (77.1%), and Australia (70.0%).

When looking at the results by industry (Figure 7), it is interesting to note that finance and healthcare see the lowest likelihood of successful attacks (62.1% and 56.0%, respectively). We think that reflects the fact that those two sectors have made some of the largest investments in cybersecurity over the last few years.

![Figure 6: Percentage of organizations indicating that compromise by a successful cyberattack in 2025 is somewhat or very likely, by country.](placeholder_image_description)

![Figure 7: Percentage of organizations indicating that compromise by a successful cyberattack in 2025 is somewhat or very likely, by industry.](placeholder_image_description)

### Security Posture by IT Domain

**On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your organization’s overall security posture (ability to defend against cyberthreats) in each of the following IT components:**

![Figure 8: Perceived security posture by IT domain.](placeholder_image_description)

Cybersecurity teams need to protect many different types of devices, applications, and infrastructure components. Our survey asked respondents to rate their organization’s security posture in 13 of those domains (see Figure 8).

Overall, respondents are fairly confident about their organization’s ability to defend itself. Their ratings across the board averaged 3.97 on a scale of one to five, with five being the best possible security posture.

But they are a touch less confident than they were last year or the year before. From the 2023 report to last year’s, the security posture rating fell in 10 of the 13 categories. The change this year was similar: declines in 11 of the 13. The average rating across all categories, which we call the “Security Posture Index,” did not decrease much: by 0.05 and then 0.03 (see Figure 9). However, the trend points to nervousness among security teams that their defenses may not be keeping up with the advances made by threat actors.

![Figure 9: The Security Posture Index.](placeholder_image_description)

“Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets... dropped... to the bottom. That is not because defenses for those devices got worse, but rather that phones have been storing more and more confidential business data and threat actors are developing new attacks against them.”

Respondents were most comfortable about the security of “Cloud applications (SaaS)” and nearly as comfortable with “Cloud infrastructure (IaaS, PaaS).” This reflects the fact that cloud service providers have made great strides in improving the security of their environments, in many cases by creating their own native security tools.

Organizations are also relatively confident about their security posture for servers and datastores. Most of these are mature technologies, supported by proven security tools and a body of security best practices.

Speaking of mature technologies, “Desktops (PCs)” was the one domain where the security posture rating improved from the previous report.

One area of great concern continues to be industrial control systems, which has been in the bottom position for several years. Survey respondents also consider internet of things (IoT) security to be a weak spot, which fell two places on the list to tie with application containers for third from worst.

And the IT domain where security teams are least confident? “Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets),” which also dropped two places, from third from worst to the bottom. That’s not because defenses for those devices got worse, but rather that:

*   Phones have been storing more and more confidential business data.
*   Threat actors have been developing new attacks against them.

### Assessing IT Security Functions

**On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate the adequacy of your organization’s capabilities (people and processes) in each of the following functional areas of IT security:**

![Figure 10: Perceived adequacy of security capabilities by functional area.](placeholder_image_description)

Confidence in the adequacy of defenses across functional areas of IT security fell significantly in this survey, for the second year in a row. In both years, ratings declined in 11 of the 12 categories tracked. In fact, this year confidence didn’t go up in any of the areas. The one that didn’t go down, “Brand protection,” simply remained unchanged.

As with the previous question about security posture by IT domain, we don’t think respondents are complaining that defenses got weaker. Rather, they sense that attack surfaces are getting larger and new attack techniques are developing faster.

The functional areas with the biggest declines in scores were “Cyber risk quantification and reporting (GRC),” “Detection of advanced/sophisticated threats,” and “User security awareness/education.”

Other major areas of concern are “Detection of rogue insiders/insider attacks” and “Third-party risk management (TPRM),” which were third from the bottom and tied for the bottom spot, respectively (see Figure 10).

One of the relatively bright spots was “Incident investigation and response,” which moved from the fifth position from the top last year to the second position this year. “Brand protection” also moved up, from eighth place to fifth.

Organizations feel most comfortable about their capabilities for “Identity and access management (IAM),” “Incident investigation and response,” “Cyber risk quantification and reporting (GRC),” “Security engineering, architecture, and design,” and “Brand protection,” all of which had average ratings of 4.04 or 4.05 on a five-point scale.

“Confidence in the adequacy of defenses across functional areas of IT security fell significantly in this survey, for the second year in a row. In both years, ratings declined in 11 of the 12 categories tracked. We don’t think respondents are complaining that defenses got weaker. Rather, they sense that attack surfaces are getting larger and new attack techniques are developing faster.”

## Section 2: Perceptions and Concerns

### Concern for Cyberthreats

**On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate your overall concern for each of the following types of cyberthreats targeting your organization:**

The threats doing the most to cause sleepless nights are not going to surprise you. Our leading nightmares are malware (with a score of 3.92 on a scale of 1 to 5), phishing (3.87), ransomware (3.83), “Account takeover and credential abuse attacks” (3.79), “Denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks” (3.74), and “Advanced persistent threats (APTs)/targeted attacks” (also 3.74). These are the same top six as last year, in exactly the same order, except for ransomware and ATO switching places in the third and fourth positions. These are the cyberthreats most directly connected with data breaches and extortion, i.e., the threats that produce the biggest monetary returns for adversaries.

The bottom (relatively least concerning) end of the list also changed very little over the past few years. The leaders there are “Attacks on brand and reputation in social media and on the web” (3.64), “Drive-by downloads/watering-hole attacks” (3.63), “Supply chain threats” (3.62), and “Zero-day attacks (against publicly unknown vulnerabilities” (3.59).

![Figure 11: Relative concern for cyberthreats.](placeholder_image_description)

We are a little surprised to see respondents so sanguine about supply chain threats, since there were some very visible supply chain attacks in 2024, including a number associated with security and network security tools. Perhaps cybersecurity teams feel that enough controls are in place to blunt these attacks? Or perhaps there is a bit of a “that’s not my problem” attitude, since the primary responsibility to prevent supply chain security issues may fall on the teams buying and managing infrastructure and on third-party risk management groups, rather than cybersecurity groups.

![Figure 12: Threat Concern Index, depicting overall concern for cyberthreats.](placeholder_image_description)

What is the big picture? You can see it in Figure 12, which shows CyberEdge’s Threat Concern Index. This is an average of the scores for the 12 cyberthreat types included in this section. The overall concern for cyberthreats fell significantly between the 2022 and 2024 surveys, but plateaued this year. We think the earlier improvement reflects the return of workers to offices, increased investment by organizations in AI and other advanced security technologies, and the widespread implementation of zero trust frameworks. However, it may be that organizations are seeing diminishing returns from investments in those areas and are perhaps becoming more worried about the dangers of threat actors doing more to capitalize on AI and deepfakes.

The most serious threats in this category, each highlighted by almost half of the respondents, were “Account takeover (ATO) and credential stuffing” attacks (46.2%) and “Personally identifiable information (PII) harvesting” (45.7%). They use stolen or leaked passwords and email addresses to impersonate customers and other legitimate users to drain money or valuable data out of web and mobile applications.

The other two leading banes of internet transactions are (a) “Carding
