## Executive Summary

The Zscaler ThreatLabz 2025 VPN Risk Report delivers an incisive look at the evolving risks associated with virtual private networks (VPNs) and underscores the urgent shift towards zero trust architectures as organizations strive to meet future-proofed security demands. Once heralded as the backbone of remote access, VPNs have increasingly become focal points for cyber threats, transitioning from essential tools to significant security risks for organizations worldwide. This report, drawing insights from over 600 IT and security professionals, reveals a critical pivot in the cybersecurity landscape: more than half of the organizations surveyed experienced attacks due to VPN vulnerabilities in the past year alone, highlighting the dire need for a new approach in today’s increasingly hybrid work environments.

In 2025, the dissatisfaction with traditional VPNs has catalyzed a shift, with enterprises overwhelmingly recognizing that patching these vulnerabilities is a race they can no longer win. This realization is driving the widespread adoption of zero trust models, which promise granular access control and significantly reduce security risks. Notably, 81% of organizations are now pivoting to implement zero trust strategies by 2026, with 65% planning to completely phase out VPNs within the same period. Moreover, operational frustrations such as slow connections, frequent disconnections, and complex authentication processes have only added to the urgency, propelling a surge in demand for zero trust solutions that ensure both seamless and secure access.

All of these shifts happen within the context of an AI-enabled threat landscape. Indeed, the rise of AI-driven cyberattacks will impact VPN security in unprecedented ways. Attackers will increasingly leverage AI for automated reconnaissance of VPN vulnerabilities, which are easily scanned over the public internet. Techniques like intelligent password spraying and rapid exploit development will allow threat actors to compromise VPN credentials at greater scale. Further down the attack chain, AI-powered evasion techniques will make it even more difficult to detect VPN-based intrusions before significant damage occurs. As such AI-driven threats grow, VPN risks will only magnify, driving enterprises to adopt proactive security measures and accelerating the already pronounced shift towards zero trust solutions.

Acknowledging these shifts, the ThreatLabz report not only charts the decline of VPNs from indispensable tools to liabilities but also provides actionable insights for enterprises navigating this transformative landscape.

## Key Findings

1.  **Obsolescence of VPNs Accelerates**: A significant 65% of enterprises are set to replace their VPN services within the next year, marking a 23% increase from 2024. This trend is primarily driven by the inability of VPNs to meet the security and compliance demands of modern enterprises, highlighting their role in exacerbating risks rather than mitigating them.

2.  **Escalation of VPN-Exploited Cyberattacks and Ransomware Concerns**: The past year saw a worrying increase in cyber incidents linked to VPN vulnerabilities, with 56% of organizations reporting such breaches, an alarming rise from previous figures. Meanwhile, 92% of respondents have concerns that unpatched VPN vulnerabilities will lead directly to ransomware attacks. These findings support the trend that, struggling to maintain the rapid pace of vulnerability patching, enterprises need a robust security overhaul to fill these critical security gaps and mitigate the ever-present risks of VPN exploitation.

3.  **End-User Dissatisfaction Influences Security Redirection**: User frustrations over VPN inefficiencies—ranging from slow speeds to cumbersome, complex, or broken authentication—are increasingly influencing organizational strategies. This end-user discontent is driving the push towards zero trust architectures that offer uninterrupted, secure access without the traditional hassles associated with VPNs.

4.  **The Zero Trust Shift from VPN: From Concept to Implementation**: Reflecting a major strategic shift, 81% of organizations are actively moving towards implementing zero trust frameworks within the next year. This marks a pivotal transition from viewing zero trust as a theoretical ideal to recognizing it as a practical necessity to replace VPNs while enhancing security in dynamic and distributed IT environments.

## VPN Risks: Why 81% of Organizations Are Pivoting to Zero Trust by 2026

VPNs were designed to provide remote access, but times have changed—and so have attackers. Today, VPNs often serve as entry points for ransomware attacks, credential theft, and cyber espionage due to vulnerabilities that are difficult to patch quickly; implicit trust models that provide complete network access; and widespread access permissions. In all, security vulnerabilities are the single largest challenge enterprises face with VPNs (according to 54% of respondents)—underscoring the fact that attackers routinely exploit unpatched flaws or bypass protections to infiltrate networks.

The risks become even more pronounced with third-party VPN access. A massive 93% of respondents express concerns over backdoor vulnerabilities introduced by external VPN connections, as attackers increasingly exploit third-party credentials to breach networks undetected. It’s not just about initial access, either—VPNs also make breaches more destructive. Unlike zero trust solutions that enforce granular policies to prevent movement within networks, VPNs provide broad access, allowing attackers to move laterally and escalate privileges. Overall, 71% of respondents identify lateral movement as a top concern, recognizing how it amplifies the scope and impact of a breach.

These challenges, paired with everyday concerns like slow performance, complex authentication, and frequent disconnections, make it clear why enterprises are moving away from VPNs in favor of zero trust models. The 2025 VPN Risk Report, based on insights from 632 IT and cybersecurity professionals, aims to shed light on the state of VPN usage in 2025 to better understand risks and challenges as well as offer enterprises best practice guidance to improve their cybersecurity posture and their approach to secure remote access.

This report’s findings offer IT and security leaders data-driven insights into the reasons to retire outdated VPNs and adopt a modern, cloud-delivered zero trust architecture. The shift from implicit trust to continuous verification is no longer optional—it is essential for securing today’s distributed enterprises, reducing IT complexity, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## VPN Security Concerns

### The Obsolescence of VPNs: Security Risks and User Frustrations

Organizations that continue to rely on VPNs for remote access find themselves increasingly exposed to security gaps, operational inefficiencies, and mounting end-user dissatisfaction, reinforcing the growing sentiment that VPNs belong to a bygone era of access security.

The top challenge—security and compliance risks, cited by 54% of respondents—reinforces the critical vulnerability of VPNs in the face of ransomware, privilege escalation, and lateral attack movement. Attackers view VPNs as weak links ripe for exploitation, while organizations struggle to patch these outdated systems fast enough to keep up with advanced threats.

User frustration has reached a boiling point: 51% of respondents identify poor VPN performance—including elements like sluggish connectivity, drop-offs, and cumbersome authentication protocols—as a roadblock to productivity. VPNs remain an operational burden, with 41% of survey respondents citing difficulties in management and 37% flagging high costs for continued maintenance. These figures illustrate how resource-intensive VPNs have become, draining IT budgets and forcing teams to spend unnecessary time on repetitive troubleshooting tasks.

**Out with Legacy Approaches, in with Zero Trust**

A recent breach serves as a stark reminder of VPN vulnerabilities. In January 2025, a Chinese cyber espionage group successfully exploited a zero-day in Ivanti’s Pulse Secure VPN, granting unauthorized access across corporate networks. This attack, one of several targeting VPN technology in recent months, highlights why organizations can no longer afford to rely on legacy access models for defending their infrastructures.

Eliminating VPN dependencies is no longer an optional upgrade—it’s an immediate necessity. Organizations need to transition to true zero trust frameworks that offer identity-driven, least-privileged access and granular segmentation. These cloud-delivered architectures help reduce lateral attack surfaces, improve user experiences, and slash IT complexity—a trifecta of benefits that VPNs simply cannot match.

What do you see as the biggest challenges with your VPN solutions?
- Security and compliance risk: 54%
- Poor user experience: 51%
- Complex management and administration: 41%
- High cost: 37%
- Scalability and flexibility limitations: 29%
- Difficulty integrating with other systems and services: 18%

![Figure 1: The biggest challenges with VPN solutions.](Image description: A bar chart showing the biggest challenges with VPN solutions, with security and compliance risk being the highest at 54%.)

### Ransomware and VPNs: A Perfect Storm of Risk

Ransomware groups continue to exploit vulnerabilities in VPNs with devastating precision, leveraging both zero-day flaws and known weaknesses before organizations can deploy security patches. VPNs have become a ‘low-hanging fruit’ for attackers due to their widespread adoption and reliance on outdated network trust models.

Overall, 92% of survey respondents expressed high levels of concern about ransomware targeting unpatched VPN vulnerabilities, highlighting the critical need for more robust protection mechanisms. This data underscores why VPNs are now seen as liabilities rather than reliable tools for mitigating modern cyber risks.

Real-world examples continue to validate these fears. In January 2023, multiple US healthcare organizations fell victim to a ransomware attack driven by an unpatched Citrix NetScaler vulnerability (CVE-2023-4966). This exploit enabled attackers to infiltrate systems, disrupt hospital operations, lock patient records, and force facilities to divert critical emergency care—all because the vulnerability had not been patched in time. This incident underscores the pervasive risk posed by unpatched VPNs. Threat actors regularly scan for exposed systems, ensuring they can capitalize on vulnerabilities before organizations apply fixes, leaving organizations at risk for compromise, operational disruption, and financial loss.

Organizations must step off the endless treadmill of patching and adopt proactive defensive strategies tailored for evolving threats. Zero trust frameworks prioritize identity-driven access control and continuous verification, ensuring a major reduction in ransomware risk—even when vulnerabilities remain unpatched. Automated detection systems and dynamic policies further contain potential breaches, preventing attackers from moving laterally or escalating privileges.

How concerned are you about being targeted by ransomware due to unpatched vulnerabilities?
- Extremely concerned: 31%
- Very concerned: 28%
- Moderately concerned: 16%
- Slightly concerned: 17%
- Not concerned at all: 8%

![Figure 2: Concerns about ransomware attacks.](Image description: A bar chart showing the level of concern about ransomware attacks due to unpatched vulnerabilities, with "Extremely concerned" at 31%.)

## VPNs and Lateral Movement: Increasing the Blast Radius of Breaches

In addition to enabling initial compromise through ransomware and other threats, VPNs facilitate lateral movement—a dangerous attack technique. Attackers exploit the extensive access VPNs provide to escalate privileges and infiltrate deeper into target networks, often with devastating consequences.

A total of 71% of respondents expressed some level of concern for this risk, with 32% expressing high levels of concern. These feelings are justified as VPNs typically grant broad network access, allowing attackers to move undetected, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive data once inside.

In September 2024, attackers exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti’s Cloud Service Appliance (CSA), notably CVE-2024-8963 and CVE-2024-8190, to breach several organizations, as confirmed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI. Attackers bypassed administrative controls, executed arbitrary commands, harvested credentials, and implanted web shells, enabling lateral movement across networks. Despite previous security incidents involving Ivanti VPNs, these new exploits demonstrate that patching or rearchitecting legacy VPN solutions still fails to address the fundamental security flaws inherent in network-based remote access models.

How concerned are you that attackers will move laterally across your network if a VPN is compromised?
- Extremely concerned: 39%
- Very concerned: 25%
- Moderately concerned: 18%
- Slightly concerned: 11%
- Not concerned at all: 7%

![Figure 3: Enterprise concerns that will move laterally across the network if a VPN is compromised.](Image description: A bar chart showing enterprise concerns about lateral movement if a VPN is compromised, with "Extremely concerned" at 39%.)

To mitigate these risks, organizations must transition from VPN-based access to Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) with strict segmentation. Unlike VPNs, which grant users broad network access, ZTNA provides application-level access based on identity and context, ensuring users can only access the specific resources they need. This approach prevents lateral movement even if attackers gain initial access, drastically reducing the attack surface and potential blast radius of breaches. Additionally, implementing network and micro-segmentation strengthens security by isolating critical systems and preventing unauthorized communication between compromised and secure assets.

## VPN CVEs from 2020-2025: A Rising Wave of High-Severity Vulnerabilities

No software is immune from security vulnerabilities, nor should it be expected to be. However, in the case of VPN technology, vulnerabilities, particularly zero-day threats, can be particularly damaging, because threat actors can easily probe for impacted VPN infrastructure and exploit it before any patch is released or has been applied. CVE reporting is a good thing, as this community-wide effort helps vendors and customers follow best practice and improve their cyber hygiene through patching and disclosure. How these CVEs are discovered and the information they contain reflects changes in the evolving threat landscape.

Zscaler ThreatLabz analyzed 411 VPN Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from 2020-2025, as reported by the MITRE CVE Program. The findings indicate a surge of VPN vulnerabilities that have gradually risen through the first half of this decade. These CVEs cover a wide range of VPN failures — from exploitation of web-based management interfaces through command injection and input validation vulnerabilities, to cryptographic failures and DoS and DDoS attacks. There is no shortage of recent VPN vulnerabilities, many of which have led to major, highly visible security breaches.

Many of these CVEs are critical. In 2024, for instance, 60% of the 83 VPN vulnerabilities reported by NIST indicated a high or critical CVSS score. Meanwhile, remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, which allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands and potentially lead to system compromise, were the most common VPN CVEs. In other words, far from being innocuous, the majority of VPN CVEs in the past year left their users extremely vulnerable to exploits that attackers execute with relative ease. Moreover, many of these CVEs were zero-day exploits. While CVEs in 2025 are still low in the early part of the year, major vulnerabilities have already been disclosed, such as two zero-day exploits, CVE-2025-0282 and CVE-2025-0283.

![Figure 4: Total VPN CVEs for each year, from 2020-2024.](Image description: A line graph showing the total number of VPN CVEs per year from 2020 to 2024, indicating a rising trend.)

### Key Trends: CVE Impact Types

To understand the potential harm of these vulnerabilities if they were to be exploited, ThreatLabz assessed VPN CVEs across five categories of attack: remote code execution (RCE), privilege escalation, information leakage, denial of service (DoS) and authentication bypass. Note some categories are catch-all groupings for separate, but closely related, kinds of attacks: for example, authentication bypass includes attacks that may bypass second-factor or multi-factor authentication (MFA), while other bypass basic authentication measures. In general, any RCE vulnerability will be a high-priority item to remediate for any organization.

**1. RCE Remains the Top Threat**
*   **Observation**: RCE vulnerabilities top the list across all four years, with 32 alone in 2024. RCE accounts for 149 CVEs including 2025 data, making it the most frequent and critical vulnerability type.
*   **Implication**: RCE vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on VPN devices, potentially leading to full system compromise. Enterprises should prioritize patching and securing systems vulnerable to such exploits.

**2. Privilege Escalation is Steadily Growing Over Time**
*   **Observation**: There is a steady increase in privilege escalation CVEs (66.7%), peaking in 2024 with 20 vulnerabilities.
*   **Implication**: Attackers increasingly exploit VPN flaws to escalate privileges, gaining administrative control over systems. Enterprises must ensure secure system configurations and restrict privilege access tightly.

**3. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities Show a Sharp 200% Rise**
*   **Observation**: DoS-related CVEs tripled from 9 in 2020 to 27 in 2024, becoming the second-highest impact type in recent years — 85 CVEs overall, including 2025 data so far.
*   **Implication**: DoS attacks are evolving in sophistication, making VPN systems prime targets for operational disruptions. Enterprises should adopt rate-limiting and traffic shaping to mitigate these risks.

**4. Sensitive Information Leakage is Rarer but Still Critical**
*   **Observation**: Though relatively less common, with 41 CVEs total, sensitive information leakage vulnerabilities expose critical credentials, encryption keys, and user data.
*   **Implication**: This impact type is particularly damaging for confidentiality and compliance. Enterprises should implement robust encryption, secure coding practices, and traffic monitoring to detect and prevent data leaks.

**5. Steady Growth in Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities**
*   **Observation**: Authentication bypass incidents have been relatively low, but consistent, growing from 4 in 2020, to a peak of 6 in 2023, to 4 vulnerabilities in 2024 — totaling 30 CVEs over time.
*   **Implication**: Attackers are targeting weaknesses in multi-factor authentication (MFA) and login logic to impersonate users. Enterprises should strengthen MFA configurations and monitor for abnormal login behaviors.

![Figure 5: The impact type of VPN CVEs from 2020-2024, covering RCE, privilege escalation, DoS Sensitive Information Leakage, Authentication Bypass.](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing VPN CVEs by impact type from 2020-2024, illustrating the prevalence of RCE, DoS, and privilege escalation.)

### Key Trends: Critical VPN Vulnerabilities

Beyond impact types, ThreatLabz also analyzed the severity of VPN CVEs each year. Overall, ThreatLabz found the CVEs with CVSS scores of HIGH or CRITICAL grew 38.9% from 2020 to 2024. Indeed, 66.3% of all CVEs in 2024 year were rated as HIGH or CRITICAL, indicating a potential severe impact to organizations when such CVEs are exploited before they are patched. Moreover, ThreatLabz analyzed critical trends across different types of vulnerabilities represented in the CVE data that enterprises should understand to better defend against evolving VPN threats.

![Figure 6: The volume of VPN CVEs with HIGH and CRITICAL CVSS scores from 2020-2024.](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the volume of VPN CVEs with HIGH and CRITICAL CVSS scores from 2020-2024.)

**1. Increasing Exploitation of Web-Based Management Interfaces**
*   **Trend**: Command injection and input validation vulnerabilities have consistently risen, indicating attackers’ growing focus on administrative and management portals, both from an administrator and end-user perspective. As these interfaces are inherently exposed to the internet via their architecture, they are prone to exploitation from threat actors.
*   **Escalation**: While these vulnerabilities were present in 2020–2021, they significantly intensified from 2022 onward, suggesting attackers see these management interfaces as attractive and accessible targets, especially due to inadequate security coding practices.

**2. Widespread Authentication and MFA Bypasses**
*   **Trend**: Attacks specifically targeting authentication methods—including MFA bypasses, session hijacking, and improper session management—steadily increased.
*   **Escalation**: Earlier years (2020–2021) primarily saw simpler authentication bypasses, while from 2023–2025, these evolved into more advanced, automated, and persistent attacks aimed explicitly at MFA weaknesses, indicating attackers’ intent to undermine stronger security measures.

**3. Rise in Local Privilege Escalation Exploits**
*   **Trend**: Local privilege escalation vulnerabilities have become more prevalent and increasingly severe.
*   **Escalation**: What began as minor configuration oversights in 2020–2021 intensified by 2024–2025 into more sophisticated privilege-escalation methods, such as DLL hijacking, giving attackers deeper system-level access.

**4. Growing Sophistication of DoS and DDoS Attacks**
*   **Trend**: DoS attacks evolved from basic resource exhaustion (2020–2021) to sophisticated DDoS amplification techniques (2024–2025).
*   **Escalation**: Attackers transitioned from simple malformed packet-based disruptions to more advanced amplified attacks, reflecting a strategic escalation to maximize operational disruption.

**5. Persistent and Intensifying Cryptographic Failures**
*   **Trend**: Issues related to cryptographic implementation—such as improper certificate validation, leaked keys, and insufficient TLS verification—have escalated notably.
*   **Escalation**: Starting around 2022, there was a noticeable spike in cryptographic vulnerabilities, peaking in 2024–2025 with high-severity flaws. This increase shows adversaries’ strategic interest in exploiting encryption-related weaknesses to undermine VPN confidentiality.

## VPN Security Concerns (Cont.)

### The Challenges of Implementing Segmentation

Given the risks of lateral movement, many organizations try to limit attack spread through segmentation. While segmentation is a critical defense mechanism to reduce attack surface, its implementation is often challenging.

The survey highlights these challenges, with 51% of organizations anticipating or encountering configuration complexity. Additionally, 39% report a lack of expertise and resources, while 24% face performance bottlenecks—indicating that legacy network architectures are poorly equipped to support the granular access controls required for today’s IT environments.

Segmentation challenges played a notable role in the 2023 MGM Resorts ransomware attack, where attackers gained initial access through social engineering but were able to move laterally due to insufficient segmentation. The breach disrupted hotel operations, ATMs, and casino gaming systems, costing the company an estimated US$100 million in damages. This case highlights how poor segmentation allows attackers to pivot across critical systems, amplifying the impact of an initial intrusion.

To address these challenges, organizations should implement cloud-based, identity-driven segmentation models that streamline policy enforcement and reduce manual overhead. Unlike traditional network segmentation, which relies on complex firewall rules and VLAN configurations, a zero trust approach enables dynamic segmentation based on user identity, device posture, and real-time risk assessments. This ensures only authorized users can access specific applications while keeping the broader network secure.

What problems did your organization encounter or foresee while implementing segmentation?
- Difficulty to configure and complex to manage policies: 51%
- Don’t have sufficient resources or lack of expertise: 39%
- Performance bottlenecks: 24%
- Very expensive: 11%

![Figure 7: The top challenges enterprises face when implementing segmentation.](Image description: A bar chart showing the top challenges enterprises face when implementing segmentation, with "Difficulty to configure and complex to manage policies" at 51%.)

### VPNs Increase M&A Cybersecurity Risks

Beyond day-to-day security challenges, major IT transitions—such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A)—pose additional risks and expand attack surfaces. These transitions often involve merging disparate networks, applications, and identities, which can lead to inherited vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weak security controls.

Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents expressed concern about cyberthreats following M&A, acknowledging the security gaps that arise during IT integrations.

A recent example is the 2023 Capita data breach, where attackers exploited security weaknesses following a corporate acquisition, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. The incident stemmed from misaligned security policies between the merged entities, allowing threat actors to move laterally across the newly integrated network. This breach underscores how inconsistent security controls, legacy VPN access, and unsegmented environments create ideal conditions for cyberattacks during M&A activity.

To mitigate these risks during M&A, organizations must prioritize cybersecurity due diligence, enforce least-privileged access, and implement segmentation. Unlike VPN-based access models, zero trust prevents merged IT environments from inheriting broad access permissions, effectively reducing the risk of lateral movement and privilege escalation. By replacing VPNs and perimeter-based defenses with identity-driven access controls that validate every request, organizations can secure both legacy and newly integrated IT environments.

Are you concerned about being vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks post M&A?
- Yes: 64%
- No: 36%

![Figure 8: Enterprises are concerned about cyber attacks after M&A](Image description: A pie chart showing enterprise concerns about cyber attacks after M&A, with 64% expressing concern.)

### Third-Party VPN Access: A Backdoor for Attackers

Third-party access has emerged as one of the most vulnerable entry points for attackers. Traditional VPNs, by design, rely on broad network access once authentication is completed, extending this privilege to external vendors and partners. This practice creates blind spots that attackers are eager to exploit. Attackers can exploit stolen or weak credentials, misconfigurations, and unpatched vulnerabilities to hijack these trusted connections. With 93% of respondents expressing critical concerns about backdoor vulnerabilities, third-party access represents a ticking time bomb for organizations reliant on static, trust-based access models.

This concern is well-founded. In August 2024, Enterprise Financial Group (EFG) suffered a significant data breach exposing the personal information of nearly 20,000 clients. The breach was traced back to vulnerabilities in a third-party VPN used by EFG, which attackers exploited to infiltrate the network and access sensitive data. This incident underscores how third-party VPNs create security gaps that attackers can exploit as entry points into corporate networks.

Organizations should start by auditing third-party VPN access and enforcing stricter policy controls, such as time-limited access, end-to-end traffic inspection (device to application), and adaptive authentication. Transitioning to a zero trust model will enable enforcement of application-specific access, ensuring external partners only have the minimal access required. Furthermore, continuous monitoring and risk-based policies can significantly mitigate third-party vulnerabilities.

How concerned are you about third parties serving as a potential backdoor for attackers into your network through their VPN access?
- Extremely concerned: 30%
- Very concerned: 24%
- Moderately concerned: 13%
- Slightly concerned: 26%
- Not concerned at all: 7%

![Figure 9: Enterprise concerns about third-party VPN access facilitating cyber attacks.](Image description: A bar chart showing enterprise concerns about third-party VPN access facilitating cyber attacks, with "Extremely concerned" at 30%.)

### Challenges and Gaps with Legacy Protective Measures

#### Traditional Tools Leave for Private Applications Exposed

Securing private applications against increasingly sophisticated web-based threats—such as ransomware, credential theft, and API abuse—has become a mission-critical priority for modern enterprises. Yet many organizations continue relying on legacy tools ill-equipped to counter today’s threat landscape.

According to the survey, firewalls (84%), web application firewalls (WAFs, 58%), and VPNs (43%) still dominate organizations’ web attack defenses. However, attackers are increasingly bypassing these tools—leveraging unpatched devices, poor configurations, and inherent weaknesses in perimeter-based security models—showing that these legacy defenses no longer meet the demands of modern threat landscapes.

Recent breaches highlight the shortcomings of such perimeter-based defenses. In August 2024, Chinese hackers — a group dubbed Salt Typhoon — infiltrated major US telecommunications firms, including AT&T and Verizon, by exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched network devices and routers. This attack compromised sensitive metadata of more than 1 million users, demonstrating how sophisticated adversaries can circumvent traditional security measures like firewalls and VPNs.

The only viable solution for effectively protecting private applications is to move beyond outdated perimeter defenses and adopt zero trust access models. Zero trust architectures eliminate reliance on network-based security, allowing users to connect directly to applications under strictly enforced policies of granular, least-privileged access. Unlike firewalls and VPNs, zero trust architectures enable users to connect directly to applications with granular, least-privileged access. This approach blocks unauthorized access attempts and prevents lateral movement, session hijacking, and credential theft—the tactics attackers commonly use to circumvent traditional perimeter defenses.

What products do you use to protect your private applications against web-based attacks?
- Firewalls: 84%
- WAF: 58%
- VPNs: 43%

![Figure 10: The security products in-use by enterprises to defend private applications from web-based threats.](Image description: A bar chart showing the security products used by enterprises to defend private applications from web-based threats, with Firewalls at 84%.)

#### NAC Deployment in VPN Environments: A Limited Safeguard

A notable 54% of surveyed organizations report using NAC to secure VPN access to private resources. However, these deployments have yet to prevent the breaches and exploits commonly associated with VPN vulnerabilities, highlighting NAC’s inability to address the systemic risks of network-based trust models.

NAC solutions enforce device posture checks, authentication, and network segmentation. However, they fail to address core VPN security issues such as broad access permissions, lateral movement risks, and reliance on implicit trust.

Recent breaches demonstrate that even with NAC in place, VPN vulnerabilities remain a critical weakness. In November 2023, the US Department of Energy confirmed a major security incident involving compromised VPN credentials, which allowed attackers to bypass access controls and infiltrate sensitive internal systems. This highlights how attackers can exploit VPN weaknesses directly, either through stolen credentials, unpatched vulnerabilities, or session hijacking—rendering NAC an incomplete defense if the underlying trust model remains unchanged.

Are you using a NAC (Network Access Control) in between your VPN and Private Resources?
- Yes: 54%
- No: 46%

![Figure 11: Proportion of enterprises using NAC in between VPNs and private resources.](Image description: A pie chart showing the proportion of enterprises using NAC in between VPNs and private resources, with 54% using it.)

To overcome the limitations of NAC and legacy VPN architectures, organizations must adopt a zero trust security model. Zero trust eliminates broad network trust by allowing users to connect directly to specific applications under continuously validated policies tied to identity, device posture, and context. Zero trust not only blocks unauthorized access but also shuts down lateral movement, thwarting attackers before they can escalate privileges or exfiltrate data.

## VPN User Experience and Management Issues

### The VPN Performance Problem: Frustrating Users and Overloading IT

VPNs are not just a security liability—they are also a major source of user dissatisfaction. End users increasingly express frustrations with VPN performance issues, which create obstacles for productivity and add to the growing strain on IT teams.

Slow connection speeds are the most common complaint (23%), underscoring VPNs’ reputation for latency, congestion, and poor performance when accessing cloud applications from home. Authentication challenges also remain a significant issue, with 20% of respondents citing complex login processes and 17% struggling with application access due to authentication errors.

These performance challenges disrupt daily business operations, dampen productivity, and turn the IT help desk into a bottleneck as teams wrestle with frequent troubleshooting requests—a problem that only worsens as remote and hybrid work environments grow in complexity.

Replacing VPNs with zero trust network access (ZTNA) not only eliminates bandwidth congestion but also vastly improves the end-user experience by enabling direct, secure, and latency-free connections to applications. Unlike VPNs, which route all traffic through a central gateway and create performance bottlenecks, ZTNA enables direct and secure access to applications without performance degradation. By adopting identity-driven access controls, continuous verification, and cloud-delivered security, organizations can not only eliminate common VPN frustrations but also boost workforce productivity and reduce the IT burden of troubleshooting and supporting inflexible VPN frameworks.

What is the most common complaint reported by your users when accessing applications via VPN?
- Slow connection speed when accessing applications: 23%
- Complex or cumbersome VPN authentication process: 20%
- Difficulty in accessing applications due to authentication issues: 17%
- Problems with connection drops while using VPN: 14%
- Inconsistent user experience across different devices/platforms: 13%
- Inability to connect to VPN or to access applications altogether: 9%

![Figure 12: The most common complaints among VPN users.](Image description: A bar
