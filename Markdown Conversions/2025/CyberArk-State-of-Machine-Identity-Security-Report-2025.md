Organizations Are Leaning Hard
into Machine Identity Security

Machine identity security is rapidly becoming one of the most critical aspects of modern
cybersecurity strategies. While CISOs and IT leaders recognize its importance, many are
still struggling to build a cohesive approach to protect these digital credentials. Machine
identities play a unique and foundational role in both modern and traditional systems,
connecting devices, applications, APIs and cloud native technologies securely. However,
as their use continues to expand, so does the complexity of managing them effectively.

Machine identities now outnumber human identities by an overwhelming margin. This
sheer scale is driven by several factors, including the rise of cloud native technologies,
artificial intelligence (AI) and the shrinking lifespans of machine credentials in today’s
fast-paced development cycles. Each instance requires a unique identity to authenticate
and communicate securely, adding to the already staggering growth in machine
identities—particularly as organizations begin to embrace agentic AI.

At the same time, malicious actors have taken notice, and cybercriminals are targeting
machine identities as entry points for attacks. And machine identity attacks are
growing. By exploiting weaknesses in authentication systems or leveraging expired or
mismanaged credentials, attackers can move laterally within networks, access sensitive
data and disrupt critical operations. The increasing reliance on machine identities
magnifies their risks, making them a prime focus for threat actors seeking to undermine
enterprise security.

To better understand how these challenges are impacting today’s enterprise security,
we surveyed 1,200 security leaders across the USA, UK, Australia, France, Germany and
Singapore. Read on to learn the findings.

Machine Identities
Growing Faster than
Human Identities

One of the reasons that machine identity vulnerabilities are becoming more
commonplace is that there are simply more machine identities than ever—
and that means more points of potential failure. The number of machine
identities is growing exponentially, outpacing human identities and reshaping
enterprise security priorities. It’s not surprising that 79% of organizations
expect the number of machine identities to grow over the next year, with 63%
projecting increases of up to 50% and 16% anticipating more aggressive
growth between 50-150% per year.

With machines already radically outnumbering humans in organizations, the
growing disparity is clear. Cloud native technologies, AI and microservices
drive this rapid growth, as workloads and containers spin up dynamically,
often lasting minutes rather than years. Each instance demands unique
identities to operate securely, adding to the growing complexity of machine
identity security.

machine and human identities as equal priorities, “equal” attention doesn’t necessarily reflect the
growing scale or importance of machine identities.

The surge in machine identities is undeniable, and elevating their security as a core priority is
essential for safeguarding enterprise operations.

Why Machine Identity Security Programs Lack Maturity
and Need to Be Programmatically Strengthened

Let’s not forget that machine identities outnumber human identities by orders of
magnitude, making them an undeniable priority for every organization. With the
rapid adoption of cloud native technologies, AI advancements and the shift toward
shorter certificate lifespans, the reliance on machine identities will only continue to
grow. This surge brings not only operational complexity but also greater risk.

Cybercriminals are acutely aware of these trends and are targeting machine
identities to exploit vulnerabilities, compromise systems and disrupt critical
infrastructure. Many organizations remain vulnerable with weak links in visibility,
automation and preparedness. From cloud native workloads to quantum
cryptography, gaps in machine identity security can leave even the most advanced
organizations dangerously exposed.

The solution lies in establishing a comprehensive machine identity security
program. Such a program must prioritize automation to meet the demands of
dynamic environments, visibility to avoid blind spots and crypto agility to prepare
for emerging threats like quantum computing. These foundational elements not
only prevent attacks but also ensure the availability of critical systems, letting
organizations scale securely and innovate with confidence.
