# Introduction

# Foreword

In the relentless landscape of modern cybersecurity, the adage "knowledge is power" has never been more

critical. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) stand as the frontline defense for organizations worldwide, yet they

are increasingly besieged by an escalating "alert problem" and the sheer volume of data generated by a

proliferating array of security tools. Traditional approaches which were once sufficient are now strained to their

breaking point, leaving organizations vulnerable to sophisticated and rapidly evolving threats. To make matters

worse, there is a growing talent shortage and security leaders are being asked to do more with the same.

At Prophet Security, we recognized this growing crisis. Our journey began with a clear vision: to fundamentally

transform how security teams operate, moving beyond reactive measures to proactive, intelligent defense. This

'State of AI in SOC 2025' report, based on insights from nearly 300 security leaders, illuminates the urgent need

for a paradigm shift. It reveals that an alarming 40% of alerts are routinely ignored, while a staggering 60% of

security teams have experienced critical breaches stemming from overlooked alerts. The average time to

investigate an alert remains too slow to counter today's agile adversaries. These findings underscore a critical

reality: the human-centric SOC model, without powerful augmentation, is simply unsustainable against the

modern threat landscape.

This report is more than just a collection of statistics; it is a call to action. It highlights the rapid ascent of AI for

Security as a top-three priority for security leaders. Companies are taking note, with nearly 35% of non-AI SOC

users implementing an AI SOC solution and ~60% planning to evaluate AI SOC solutions within the next year.

This is not merely a trend, but a strategic imperative. AI-native platforms are emerging as the indispensable

solution to manage data overload, accelerate triage, and empower analysts to focus on what truly matters. We

believe that by embracing AI, organizations can finally move from merely reacting to threats to anticipating and

neutralizing them with unprecedented efficiency and efficacy.

We hope through these pages you gain insights necessary to navigate this transformative era in cybersecurity.

The future of the SOC is AI-driven, and the time to adapt is now.

# Key Findings

These findings come from a survey of 282 security leaders (CISOs, Security Directors, Managers, and Analysts)

from companies over 1,000 employees primarily in the United States. See detailed demographics on Page 28.

~960

Companies of all sizes are experiencing a barrage of alerts. Smaller

enterprises and middle-market companies generate ~500 alerts per day

causing a substantial management burden while larger companies are

A concerning 40% of alerts (on average) are never investigated, leaving

organizations vulnerable to significant, avoidable security risks. Roughly

60% of security teams have reported that an ignored alert proved to be

critical, leading to a direct impact on the organization's security posture.

To cope with the alert problem, approximately 57% of companies are

actively suppressing detection rules, especially for cloud and identity.

Companies are consciously accepting increased risk to manage their

current operational limitations, making them more susceptible to

sophisticated attacks.

“AI for security” has become a top-three priority for security leaders,

following data security and cloud security. The rapid ascent of AI to a

top-tier priority indicates a widespread recognition among security

leaders that current approaches are unsustainable and that AI is a viable

path forward to address the "alert problem" and improve efficiency.

AI for Security

is a top 3 priority

55%

of companies use AI for alert
triage & investigation

Most companies use AI in some capacity for triage and investigation,

with more starting to use AI-native pure-play solutions. Of the AI non-

users,  nearly 60% plan to evaluate an AI SOC solution within the next

year, and another 30% are evaluating AI SOC solutions. This strong

intention to adopt AI signals a clear mandate for the security industry.

Security leaders anticipate AI solutions will handle approximately 60% of

SOC workloads within the next 3 years, fundamentally reshaping

security operations. It implies a dramatic reduction in manual effort,

allowing human analysts to focus on more complex, strategic tasks while

AI handles routine, high-volume operations.

The number of security tools generating alerts deployed by companies directly correlates with their size, with

larger enterprises utilizing a significantly higher average number of tools. Companies with over 20,000

employees report an average of nearly 30 security tools that generate alerts, while those with 250-999

employees use fewer than 10. This indicates a growing complexity in the security landscape, particularly for larger

organizations, where a multitude of tools generate an overwhelming volume of alerts, making it increasingly

challenging for security teams to effectively manage and respond.

alarm is ringing, but no one is answering. The feeling of

constantly "drowning in noise" fosters an environment where

an average of ~40% of all alerts are simply ignored or not

tired of false alarms and may overlook a legitimate, potentially

catastrophic breach.

The percentage of alerts that are ignored tends to increase

CISO, Financial Services Co.

This data highlights that while larger organizations investigate

a higher proportion of alerts, companies of all sizes ignore

alerts.  Even the respondents that claim 0% of alerts are

ignored, tend to rely on an MSSP or MDR which likely ignore

some alerts. This reinforces the the reality that a significant

percentage of alerts are left untriaged or ignored across the

board.

This relentless influx of alerts, often exacerbated by a high

percentage of false positives and a lack of context, leads to a

phenomenon known as "alert fatigue." Security analysts

become desensitized and overwhelmed, making it difficult to

distinguish genuine threats from background noise. This

directly impacts productivity and morale, as analysts spend

disproportionate time on low-priority or redundant

notifications. The emotional toll is significant, with many

reporting stress, burnout, and a reduced ability to relax outside

of work. This fatigue translates into critical risks: slower

response times, increased mean time to respond (MTTR), and,

most dangerously, the potential for truly critical alerts to be

missed or ignored.

This isn't just an inefficiency; it represents a profound and

unnecessary risk exposure for organizations.

# ~60% of security teams have ignored an
alert that turned out to be critical

The consequences are dire. A staggering 61% of

security teams admit to having ignored an alert that

subsequently proved to be critical, leading to outcomes

as severe as customer data exposure, system

downtime, or significant operational interference. This

"alert fatigue" is not merely an inconvenience; it is a

direct pathway to costly breaches and reputational

damage. It highlights a fundamental breakdown in the

human-centric SOC model when faced with an

unmanageable data deluge.

When segmented by company size, the middle-market

companies had the highest rates of ignoring an alert

that proved to be critical, at 77%, followed by Enterprises

and Large Enterprises at 68% and 64% respectively.

Ignoring alerts directly increases the risk of successful

cyberattacks. When critical alerts are missed, it can lead

to undetected intrusions, longer breach lifecycles, and

higher overall costs. Furthermore, failing to respond to

critical issues in a timely manner can trigger significant

regulatory penalties and legal liabilities.

Have you/your team ever ignored an
alert that turned out to be critical?

Note: critical means it risked exposing customer data,

led to a system downtime, or interfered with regular

operations

Response times are "too slow to stop attackers." Every minute an alert remains undetected or unaddressed

increases the likelihood of a successful breach, data exfiltration, or compromise. Attackers can move laterally,

escalate privileges, and achieve their objectives faster than these average investigation and dwell times allow for

detection and containment. As found in Crowdstrike’s 2025 Global Threat Report, phishing threats take only

48 minutes on average to extract sensitive information (or as little as 51 seconds in fastest recorded time).

On average, the alert dwell time is approximately 56 minutes, which refers to the time period between an alert

being fired and it being acknowledged by a team. Note how this average is longer than the average time it takes

for phishing threats to materialize into breaches.  The Mean Time To Investigate (MTTI) an alert is about 70

minutes and represents the time it takes for a security team to thoroughly investigate a generated alert. Now

imagine spending your entire day in 70 min chunks investigating alerts. How wouldn’t a human get fatigued?

These metrics underscore an urgent need for security operations to accelerate their alert triage and investigation

processes. Reducing dwell time and MTTI is paramount for effective risk reduction, necessitating solutions that

can rapidly identify, contextualize, and prioritize genuine threats amidst the overwhelming volume of alerts.

Head of Security, Retail Co

Triage/investigation takes too long (36%): This is the

leading challenge, indicating that once an alert is

generated, the process of understanding and

responding to it is excessively time-consuming. This

directly contributes to alerts being ignored, as teams

likely can't keep up with the volume.

Gaps in 24/7 SOC coverage (32%): A significant

portion of respondents face issues with continuous

monitoring, which means that during off-hours,

weekends, or holidays, alerts might not be seen or

addressed promptly, leading to them being overlooked.

Analyst burnout and/or turnover (31%): This human

element is crucial. When analysts are overwhelmed by

the volume and complexity of alerts, it leads to burnout,

which in turn causes turnover. A constantly rotating or

fatigued team will struggle to maintain vigilance,

preserve institutional knowledge, and effectively

respond to alerts.

These well known challenges all point to the current

constraints of SOC teams: there aren’t enough SOC

For organizations, "suppressing alerts" means limiting the number of detection rules they have in place. This

# Top two detection gaps companies have
due to resource constraints are Cloud and
Identity

Survey data shows that if given more triage and

investigation resources, security teams would most

urgently enable detections for Cloud (65%) and Identity

(61%) - well above other areas like Insider Threat (47%)

and DLP (29%). This prioritization underscores a critical

and growing visibility gap in two of the most dynamic

attack surfaces in today’s enterprise environments.

The decision by 57% of organizations to mute detection

rules is not just tactical triage, it reflects structural

overload within modern SOCs. By suppressing alerts

from cloud and identity sources, teams are opting for

short-term survivability at the cost of long-term visibility

debt. Every disabled rule represents a blind spot

adversaries can exploit, especially as cloud

misconfigurations and credential abuse often evade

notice until post-incident. Suppression essentially

becomes outsourced risk - a gamble against attackers

who iterate faster than most governance can respond.

Based on SACR research, the remedy is not simply “more analysts,” but smarter signal engineering and

automation. AI-powered correlation, enrichment, and scoring can reduce alert volumes dramatically without

losing fidelity. Equally vital is a cloud- and identity-focused detection engineering program that treats muted rules

as technical debt which is scheduled for review, reactivation, and refinement. By measuring the delta between

active and suppressed rules, both in coverage and potential risk, security leaders can turn today’s blind spots into

tomorrow’s strategic advantage.

Threat Hunting follows closely, with 64% of respondents

believing AI is most valuable for this proactive security activity.

AI's ability to analyze vast datasets for subtle patterns and

anomalies can empower analysts to uncover hidden threats

before they escalate.

Interestingly, Remediation and Incident Containment was cited as a secondary priority, with only 43% of
respondents selecting it. This suggests that while security leaders recognize AI's power in identification and
analysis, there's a current tendency to view human intervention as crucial in response and containment phases.
So rather than prioritizing use of AI when moving down the investigation lifecycle (towards remediation and
incident containment), organizations are looking to apply it earlier (e.g., for detection engineering and tuning).

Security Report Generation was selected by about 45% of respondents for AI's value in the SOC. While AI can
add great 'color' beyond typical dashboards, it's seen as having a lower direct impact on overall security posture.

Approximately 55% of organizations now report using AI
in some capacity to triage, investigate, or remediate
alerts. But digging deeper reveals a crucial divide in how
AI is being adopted - and how effective it is.

AI-native, pure-play SOC platforms are emerging as
solutions for the value AI can provide in security
operations. Purpose-built from the ground up by
security professionals, these platforms embed
reasoning, context, and transparency into every phase of
alert triage, investigation, and response. They’re
engineered to scale with the realities of the modern
SOC, and trained with the kind of operational nuance
only SOC leaders, CISOs, and front-line analysts can
provide. As these specialized platforms gain traction
across more forward-leaning security teams, they’re
redefining what effective, AI-driven security operations
truly look like.

By contrast, many organizations rely on bolt-on AI features from generalist platforms like Microsoft Sentinel or
Crowdstrike. While these tools can offer surface-level automation, they often depend on broadly trained models
not tailored for security operations. The result is AI that lacks investigative depth, produces more noise than clarity,
and ultimately requires analysts to do the heavy lifting. These limitations highlight why generalist solutions often
fail to deliver on the promise of faster, more efficient SOC performance.

Despite AI’s momentum, 45% of organizations still haven’t adopted any AI for alert triage or investigation, a gap
that underscores the scale of untapped opportunity. According to the 2025 SANS SOC study, about 30% of
security teams are using AI/ML within SOC operations, and another 40% are applying it in adjacent workflows.
The data is clear: while the value of AI is widely acknowledged, the opportunity lies in adopting the right kind of AI
solutions purpose-built to meet the evolving
challenges of security operations.

The detailed breakdown of organizations without a current AI solution demonstrates a strong forward momentum and a

market clearly poised for rapid AI adoption. A significant majority, approximately 95%, are actively engaged in exploring AI:

about 60% are planning on evaluating AI SOC solutions, while another 28% are already evaluating such solutions within the

next 12 months. Furthermore, a notable 6% are currently in the process of standing up an AI SOC solution.

This overwhelmingly positive outlook means that organizations are largely past the "if" and are now focused squarely on the

"how" and "when" to integrate AI into their security workflows. The critical implication is that only a very small minority,

approximately 5%, have no plans whatsoever to evaluate or use an AI SOC solution. This collective energy signals a significant

shift in investment and strategy across the industry, firmly positioning AI SOC solutions as an indispensable next step for

organizations determined to overcome the alert problem, enhance efficiency, and elevate their overall security posture. The

market is not merely interested; it's actively preparing to embrace AI to fundamentally transform its SOC capabilities.

Industry commentary:

> To better support our security analysts, we're seeking a solution that can help mitigate the current
investigative burden caused by thousands of alerts each month.

# The top metrics for tracking ROI of AI SOC
tools are:  MTTI, MTTR, and 24/7 coverage

The effectiveness of AI-driven SOC tools is most commonly measured by their impact on three critical security

metrics, the same security metrics used in every SOC. This indicates a clear focus on efficiency and response

capabilities, and in the case of AI SOC Solutions, how seamlessly it integrates with the existing workflow. Security

leaders pinpoint these as the top indicators of ROI:
