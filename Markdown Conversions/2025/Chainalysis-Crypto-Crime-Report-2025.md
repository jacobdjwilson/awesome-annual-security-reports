## Introduction

### Illicit Volumes Portend Record Year as
On-Chain Crime Becomes Increasingly
Diverse and Professionalized

In recent years, cryptocurrency has become increasingly mainstream. Although illicit activity on-chain
previously revolved heavily around cybercrime, cryptocurrency is now also being used to fund and facilitate
all kinds of threats, ranging from national security to consumer protection. As cryptocurrency has gained
greater acceptance, illicit on-chain activity, too, has become more varied. For example, some illicit actors
primarily operate off-chain, but move funds on-chain for laundering.

We report on certain deﬁned categories — stolen funds, darknet markets, and ransomware, to name a few
— on an annual basis. However, with the diversiﬁcation of crypto crime to include all types of crime, the
on-chain illicit ecosystem has witnessed increasing professionalization, with a broadening array of illicit
actor organizations and networks using cryptocurrency, as well as increased complexity in their operations.
In particular, we have seen the emergence of large-scale on-chain services that provide infrastructure for
numerous types of illicit actors to help them launder their ill-gotten crypto.

How are these developments playing out on-chain? Let’s take a look at the data and high-level trends.

According to our metrics today, it looks like 2024 saw a drop in value received by illicit cryptocurrency
addresses to a total of $40.9 billion. However, 2024 was likely a record year for inﬂows to illicit actors as
these ﬁgures are lower-bound estimates based on inﬂows to the illicit addresses we’ve identiﬁed up to
today.

A year from now, these totals will be higher, as we identify more illicit addresses and incorporate their
historic activity into our estimates. For instance, when we published last year’s Crypto Crime Report, we
reported $24.2 billion for 2023. One year later, our updated estimate for 2023 is $46.1 billion. Much of that
growth came from various types of illicit actor organizations, such as vendors operating through Huione,
which provide on-chain infrastructure and laundering services for high-risk and illicit actors.

It stands to reason that 2024’s illicit cryptocurrency volume will exceed that of 2023. Since 2020, our
annual estimates of illicit activity — which include both evidentiary attributions and Chainalysis Signals
data — have grown by an average of 25% between annual reporting periods. Assuming a similar growth
rate between now and next year’s Crypto Crime Report, our annual totals for 2024 could surpass the $51
billion threshold.

In general, our totals exclude revenue from non-crypto-native crime, such as traditional drug trafﬁcking
and other crimes in which crypto may be used as a means of payment or laundering. Such transactions are
virtually indistinguishable from licit transactions in on-chain data, although law enforcement with off-chain
information can still investigate these crimes using Chainalysis solutions. In cases where we’re able to
conﬁrm such information, we count the transactions as illicit in our data. For example, since the conviction
of FTX’s former CEO of fraud, our 2022 ﬁgures have included the $8.7 billion in creditor claims against the
exchange. However, there are almost certainly many instances where we do not have such conﬁrmation,
and therefore the numbers would not be reﬂected in our totals.

At the time of this publication, we see a reduction in absolute value of illicit activity year-over-year (YoY);
however, based on historical growth rates, we suspect that this number will eventually exceed last year’s
total as our data attributions improve. In addition, our estimate for the share of all attributed crypto
transaction volume associated with illicit activity, depicted below, also fell to 0.14% from 0.61% in 2023.¹
Similarly, we expect this share to rise over time, although historically these rates consistently remain
below 1%.

As we initially shared in our mid-year crypto crime update, another important update this year is that
we’ve begun to factor suspected illicit activity into our total estimates for certain crime types, based on
Signals data. Previously, our estimates included only totals tied to addresses for which we had supporting
documentation demonstrating that they belong to a certain illicit entity. Signals leverages on-chain data
and heuristics to identify the suspected category for a particular unknown address or cluster of addresses,
with conﬁdence levels ranging from likely to almost certain. The introduction of Signals not only grows our
estimates of certain illicit activity categories over time, but also enables us to reﬁne previous years’
estimates, given more time has passed to collect inputs and understand on-chain patterns of suspicious
activity. As bad actors continue to evolve their tactics, so too will our methods of detecting and
disrupting them.

¹ Transaction volume is a measure of all attributed economic activity, a proxy for funds changing hands. We have tweaked our
methodology this year to include only transactions involving at least one attributed entity, while removing peel chains, internal
service transactions, transactions between two personal wallets, change, and any other type of transaction that would not
count as an economic transaction between distinct economic actors.

We are also seeing a continued trend vis-à-vis the types of assets involved in crypto crime.

Through 2021, BTC was unequivocally the cryptocurrency of choice among cybercriminals, likely due to its
high liquidity. Since then, however, we have observed a steady diversiﬁcation away from BTC, with
stablecoins now occupying the majority of all illicit transaction volume (63% of all illicit transactions). This
new reality is part of a broader ecosystem trend in which stablecoins also occupy a sizable percentage of
all crypto activity, demonstrated by total growth YoY in stablecoin activity around 77%. In our 2024
Geography of Cryptocurrency report, we covered the wide array of practical use cases for stablecoins in a
range of markets, such as storing value, sending remittances, facilitating cross-border payments, and
international trade. Additionally, stablecoin issuers often freeze funds if they are made aware of their use
by illicit actors. For example, Tether has frozen addresses of concern linked to scams, terrorist ﬁnancing,
and sanctions evasion, which can make stablecoins a poor tool for the transfer of value by illicit actors.

Nonetheless, despite these ecosystem-wide trends, some forms of crypto crime, such as ransomware and
darknet market (DNM) sales, remain BTC-dominated. The popular privacy coin Monero, although an
increasingly important part of the DNM ecosystem, is not included in the analysis for this report. Other illicit
activity, such as scamming or laundering stolen funds, often take a more eclectic approach and spread out
across all asset types. Others, such as transactions associated with sanctioned entities, have shifted
primarily to stablecoins. Sanctioned entities, including individuals operating in sanctioned jurisdictions,
often have a greater incentive to use stablecoins due to challenges otherwise accessing the U.S. dollar
through traditional means amid a desire to beneﬁt from its stability.

Below, we’ll take a closer look at three key trends that deﬁned crypto crime in 2024 and will be important
to watch going forward.

*   **Stolen funds and scams still proliﬁc**
    Stolen funds increased by approximately 21% YoY to $2.2 billion. Although the largest share of stolen funds
    was robbed from decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) services, centralized services were the most targeted in Q2
    and Q3. Private key compromises accounted for the largest share (43.8%) of stolen crypto in 2024, with
    North Korean hackers stealing more from crypto platforms than ever before: $1.34 billion, representing
    61% of the total amount stolen for the year. Some of these events appear to be linked to North Korean IT
    workers, who have been increasingly inﬁltrating crypto and web3 companies, compromising their
    networks, and using sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

    High- and low-tech fraud and scams were proliﬁc in 2024, with high-yield investment scams and pig
    butchering representing the most successful fraud and scam types. We have also observed the increasing
    use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in the fraud and scams space, such as in highly personalized sextortion
    attacks. This use of AI is consistent with a broader trend across a range of illicit cybercrimes, as services
    have emerged that leverage AI to bypass know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Fraud and scam
    operators are also leveraging guarantee services such as Huione (discussed below), while crypto ATM
    scams are a growing concern, especially as they relate to elder fraud.

*   **Ransomware still front and center, darknet markets and
    fraud shop volumes on the decline**
    Ransomware has continued to see revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but a number of large,
    multilateral law enforcement disruptions coupled with decreased victim appetite to pay ransoms have
    made a dent in the ecosystem. 2024 has nonetheless been a productive year, as attack volume was
    relatively sustained and some ransomware groups have still managed to eke out payments — albeit in
    lower amounts.

    DNMs received $2 billion as opposed to close to $2.3 billion in 2023, while fraud shop volume is down by
    slightly more than half at $220.1 million. This marked decline for fraud shops is due in part to a large
    U.S.-Dutch takedown of Universal Anonymous Payment System (UAPS), a crypto payment processor that
    facilitated transactions for hundreds of fraud shops, including Brian Dumps and Faceless.

*   **Crypto crime landscape increasingly diverse and
    professionalized**
    An array of illicit actors, including transnational organized crime groups, are increasingly leveraging
    cryptocurrency for traditional crime types, such as drug trafﬁcking, gambling, intellectual property theft,
    money laundering, human and wildlife trafﬁcking, and violent crime. Furthermore, some criminal networks
    are resorting to crypto to facilitate polycrime, or multiple crime types. Indeed, of the total $40.9 billion
    received by illicit crypto addresses in 2024, $10.8 billion was received by “illicit-actor org,” our catch-all
    term for wallets of services and individuals both directly committing cybercrime like hacking, extortion,
    trafﬁcking, or scams, as well as those facilitating this activity by selling the underlying infrastructure, tools,
    and services needed to commit crime and proﬁt, including laundering-as-a-service.

    Perhaps no entity better illustrates the professionalization of the crypto crime ecosystem than the online
    marketplace Huione Guarantee. As we highlighted in our 2024 mid-year crypto crime update, Huione and
    all vendors operating on their platform have processed more than $70 billion in crypto transactions since
    2021. This platform has provided infrastructure which facilitates the sale of scam technology and
    processed on-chain transactions for pig butchering and other fraud and scams, addresses reported as
    stolen funds, sanctioned entities such as the Russian exchange Garantex, fraud shops, child sexual abuse
    material, and Chinese-language gambling sites and casinos, among others.

## Ransomware

### 35% Year-over-Year Decrease in
Ransomware Payments, Less than Half
of Recorded Incidents Resulted in Victim
Payments

The ransomware landscape experienced signiﬁcant changes in 2024, with cryptocurrency continuing to
play a central role in extortion. However, the total volume of ransom payments decreased year-over-year
(YoY) by approximately 35%, driven by increased law enforcement actions, improved international
collaboration, and a growing refusal by victims to pay.

In response, many attackers shifted tactics, with new ransomware strains emerging from rebranded,
leaked, or purchased code, reﬂecting a more adaptive and agile threat environment. Ransomware
operations have also become faster, with negotiations often beginning within hours of data exﬁltration.
Attackers range from nation-state actors to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations, lone operators,
and data theft extortion groups, such as those who extorted and stole data from Snowﬂake, a cloud
service provider.

In this chapter, we’ll explore these developments and their implications, including a variety of case studies
— LockBit, Iranian ransomware strains, Akira/Fog, and INC/Lynx — that exemplify this year’s trends.

Ransomware activity shifts halfway through the year

In 2024, ransomware attackers received approximately $813.55 million in payments from victims, a 35%
decrease from 2023’s record-setting year of $1.25 billion, and for the ﬁrst time since 2022, ransomware
revenues declined.

As we noted in our mid-year crime update, value extorted by ransomware attackers between January and
June 2024 had reached $459.8 million, approximately 2.38% higher than the value extorted over the same
time period in 2023. H1 2024 also saw a few exceptionally large payments, such as the record-breaking
$75 million payment to Dark Angels.

Despite its small half-over-half (HoH) increase, we expected 2024 to surpass 2023’s totals by the end of
the year. Fortunately, however, payment activity slowed after July 2024 by approximately 34.9%. This
slowdown is similar to the HoH decline in ransom payments since 2021 and the overall decline during H2
2024 in some types of crypto-related crime, such as stolen funds. Notably, the decline this year is more
pronounced than in the last three years.

A closer examination of the top 10 ransomware strains in terms of H1 revenue provides valuable insights
into the groups driving these HoH trends. As we see in the below chart, Akira, which has targeted more
than 250 entities since March 2023, is the only H1 top 10 ransomware strain to have ramped up its efforts
in H2 2024. LockBit, which was disrupted by the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and the
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in early 2024, saw H2 payments decrease by approximately
79%, showcasing the effectiveness of international law enforcement collaboration. ALPHV/BlackCat, which
had been among 2023’s top grossing strains, exit scammed in January 2024, leaving a void in H2.

As Lizzie Cookson, Senior Director of Incident Response at Coveware, a ransomware incident response
ﬁrm, told us, “The market never returned to the previous status quo following the collapse of LockBit and
BlackCat/ALPHV. We saw a rise in lone actors, but we did not see any group(s) swiftly absorb their market
share, as we had seen happen after prior high proﬁle takedowns and closures. The current ransomware
ecosystem is infused with a lot of newcomers who tend to focus efforts on the small- to mid-size markets,
which in turn are associated with more modest ransom demands.”

To further contextualize what may have driven H2’s decrease in ransomware payment activity, we ﬁrst
looked at data leak sites, which could be a proxy for ransomware events. In the below chart, we can see
that the number of ransomware events increased into H2, but on-chain payments declined, suggesting
that more victims were targeted, but fewer paid.

Source: ecrime.ch

Data leak sites posted more victims in 2024 than in any year prior. Not only were there more alleged
victims, but, according to Allan Liska, Threat Intelligence Analyst at Recorded Future, there were 56 new
data leak sites in 2024 — more than double the number Recorded Future identiﬁed in 2023. However, there
are some caveats to consider with data leak site information and what it suggests about the ransomware
ecosystem.

Corsin Camichel, Threat Researcher at eCrime, shared more information on the legitimacy of leaks. “We
have observed leak site posts claiming organizations, only to fail on a deeper analysis. For example, we
have seen claims for multinational organizations, but in reality, only a smaller subsidiary was impacted.
More than 100 organizations got listed on two or more data leak sites in 2024. The ‘MEOW’ leak site plays
a big role in this, seeming to compromise websites and list data taken from web servers or databases.”
Another reason for the inverse relationship between ransomware payments and data leak site victims
shown above could be that threat actors have been caught overstating or lying about victims or reposting
claims by old victims. “The LockBit operators played games to pretend to stay relevant and active after a
law enforcement action called ‘Operation Cronos,’ as they re-posted many previously listed claims again or
added attacks that happened a long time ago, some even over one year ago,” Camichel added.

Liska also shared with us information about illegitimate victims posted to data leak sites, stating, “This is
especially true of LockBit, which, in a bid to remain relevant after being ostracized by much of the
underground community post law enforcement action, has published as high as 68% repeat or straight up
fabricated victims on its data leak site.”

In the aftermath of the LockBit disruption and BlackCat’s exit scam, another interesting phenomenon has
been the rise of RansomHub RaaS, which absorbed a lot of the displaced operators from LockBit and
BlackCat. RansomHub posted the highest number of victims in 2024, according to Camichel, and despite
only emerging in February 2024, ranked in the top 10 strains for 2024, according to on-chain data.

Incident response data show that the gap between the amounts demanded and paid continues to
increase; in H2 2024, there was a 53% difference between the two factors. Reporting from incident
response ﬁrms suggests a majority of clients opt not to pay altogether, which means the actual gap is
larger than the below numbers suggest.

We spoke to Dan Saunders, Director, Incident Response, EMEA at Kivu Consulting, a cybersecurity incident
response ﬁrm, to learn more about this victim resilience. “According to our data, around 30% of
negotiations actually lead to payments or the victims deciding to pay the ransoms. Generally, these
decisions are made based on the perceived value of data that’s speciﬁcally been compromised,” he stated.
Similarly, Cookson noted that, thanks to improved cyber hygiene and overall resiliency, victims are
increasingly able to resist demands and explore multiple options to recover from an attack. “They may
ultimately determine that a decryption tool is their best option and negotiate to reduce the ﬁnal payment,
but more often, they ﬁnd that restoring from recent backups is the faster and more cost-effective path,” she
added. Final payment amounts typically ranged from $150,000 to $250,000, regardless of initial demands.

When looking at the ﬁgure below, we can see the evolution of ransomware payment distributions into
2024. In 2020, there was a long tail but a single hump to ransomware payments, but in 2024, there were
three classes of ransomware actors. Some, such as Phobos, have average payments clustering at less than
$500 – $1,000. There is another cluster around $10,000 and a third with payments north of $100,000,
some of which reached $1 million. We also see more events at the higher end of the distribution, meaning
proportionately greater attacks in excess of $1 million.

This segmentation reﬂects the shift in the ransomware actor landscape that Cookson observed, with
smaller groups dominating low- and mid-value payments, while the outlier 7-8 ﬁgure ransoms push the
distribution rightward toward the third class of payments.

In the below chart, we can see which strains were the worst in terms of total value extorted (bubble size),
median payment size (X axis), and an index of extortion events (Y axis).

Ransomware off-ramping: Where do the funds go?

Understanding ransomware laundering methods offers critical insights into post-exploit threat actor
behavior, enabling law enforcement to respond more efﬁciently and, in some cases, anticipate future
actions based on established patterns.

In the below chart, we see that ransom funds primarily ﬂowed through centralized exchanges (CEXs) (used
to off-ramp funds), personal wallets (to hold funds), and bridges (to attempt to obscure the movement of
funds). We note a substantial decline in the use of mixers in 2024. Historically, mixing services routinely
captured between 10% and 15% of ransomware quarterly money laundering ﬂows. The decline of mixing
among ransomware actors over the years is very interesting and a testament to the disruptive impact of
sanctions and law enforcement actions, such as those against Chipmixer, Tornado Cash, and Sinbad. In
place of mixers, we have noted ransomware actors increasingly rely on cross-chain bridges to facilitate
their off-ramping. In contrast, CEXs continue to be a mainstay of the ransomware offramping playbook,
with 2024 seeing a slightly above-average reliance on these types of services (39% versus 37% for the
period between 2020 and 2024).

It’s worth calling out the substantial volumes of funds being held in personal wallets. Curiously,
ransomware operators, a primarily ﬁnancially motivated group, are abstaining from cashing out more than
ever. We attribute this largely to increased caution and uncertainty amid what is probably perceived as
law enforcement’s unpredictable and decisive actions targeting individuals and services participating in or
facilitating ransomware laundering, resulting in insecurity among threat actors about where they can
safely put their funds.

While numerous factors are likely behind any one of the trends visible in the chart above, the decline in the
use of no-KYC exchanges since October 2024 may be attributed to the designation of Russia-based
exchange Cryptex and the German Federal Criminal Police (BKA)’s seizure of 47 Russian language no-KYC
crypto exchanges — both in September 2024. The timing of those enforcement actions, coupled with the
period when ransomware inﬂows to no-KYC exchanges dwindled, is conspicuous.

Ransomware case studies

Panev’s arrest and its impact on LockBit’s operations

Between 2019 and 2024, Israeli-Russian dual citizen Rostislav Panev allegedly played a crucial role in
supporting LockBit. He is accused of developing several tools for the group, including one that enabled
attackers to print ransom notes from any printer connected to compromised systems, for which he was
reportedly paid around $230,000 in bitcoin (BTC). While Russian nationals, including LockBit’s
administrator Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, have previously faced sanctions for their roles in these attacks,
it is important to recognize that ransomware is truly a global threat, involving actors from around the
world. Panev is currently in Israel awaiting extradition to the United States, where he is wanted for
conspiracy to commit fraud, cybercrime, wire fraud, and other offenses.

In the Reactor graph we can see, per the indictment, the transfer of roughly $5,000 in BTC from Khoroshev
on a biweekly basis beginning in 2022. Then, from July 2023 through early 2024, approximately $10,000 in
BTC was transferred to Khoroshev on a monthly basis.

Panev’s arrest potentially marked a signiﬁcant blow to LockBit’s ability to reconstitute, and highlighted
that, even years after a crime has been committed, blockchain’s transparent and immutable nature
continues to empower law enforcement to trace illicit activities and disrupt transnational cybercrime
syndicates. The LockBit takedown and Panev’s arrest were major victories in 2024 and sparked a shift
toward a more fragmented and less coordinated ecosystem.

Iranian ransomware involvement

In addition to Russian-speaking cybercriminals, within the past several years, Iranian nationals have also
been sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Ofﬁce of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for their
involvement in facilitating and conducting ransomware attacks. We’ve also previously noted on-chain
evidence of LockBit afﬁliates working with Iranian ransomware strains and depositing funds at an Iranian
exchange.

Fortunately, through our on-chain analysis, we can identify Iranian actors as they rebrand or switch to a
different RaaS. As we see in the below Chainalysis Reactor graph, we tied four different ransomware
strains to the same Iranian threat actor, who likely also deployed a popular RaaS strain. We also see the
reuse of deposit addresses at multiple global exchanges, connecting these seemingly disparate strains —
not only to each other, but also conﬁrming the operator’s Iran ties.

Major strains rebranding, launching offshoots

Since Akira’s emergence, it has proven successful in exploiting vulnerabilities — particularly in enterprise
environments — and has gained traction with a number of high-proﬁle attacks. As we mentioned above,
Akira is the only top 10 ransomware strain to have ramped up its efforts in H2 2024.

In September 2024, Fog, a new ransomware strain, entered the scene, and has since demonstrated an
ability to target critical vulnerabilities, much like Akira. Both groups have primarily focused on exploiting
VPN vulnerabilities, which allows them to gain unauthorized access to networks and consequently deploy
their ransomware.

Both Akira and Fog have used identical money laundering methods, which are distinct from other
ransomware strains, further supporting a connection between them. For instance, the following
Chainalysis Reactor graph shows that several wallets operated by Akira and Fog have transferred funds to
the same no-KYC exchange.

In addition to Akira’s relationship to Fog, we have also discerned links between the INC and Lynx
ransomware variants by examining similar on-chain behaviors. Cybersecurity researchers have also noted
the two strains’ shared source code.

These overlapping relationships illustrate a broader trend within the ransomware ecosystem: the
continuous evolution of cybercriminal strategies in response to increased law enforcement scrutiny.

Navigating an evolving threat landscape

Ransomware in 2024 reﬂected shifts driven by law enforcement action, improved victim resilience, and
emerging attack trends. Crackdowns and collaboration with incident response ﬁrms and blockchain
experts helped disrupt many ransomware groups, reducing their proﬁtability. Victims also demonstrated
greater resistance to ransom demands, widening the gap between demands and payments.

Financial strategies continue to adapt under law enforcement pressure, although malicious actors face
increasing difﬁculties laundering payments from victims. Sustained collaboration and innovative defenses
will remain critical to building on the progress made in 2024.

## Darknet Markets

### Darknet market and fraud shop BTC
revenues decline amid years-long
international law enforcement disruption

A series of law enforcement takedowns in the last few years have shaped the 2024 drug and fraud
ecosystems. While 2024 was likely a record year for crypto crime revenue overall, darknet market (DNM)
and fraud shop inﬂows fell, with DNMs receiving just over $2 billion in BTC on-chain, and fraud shops
$225 million.

Historically, DNMs have been known for the illicit drug trade, but in recent years have differentiated
themselves with unique service offerings. This trend, however, is not universal. For example, in
Russia-based DNMs, the illicit drug trade remains predominant. Since last year’s Crypto Crime Report, the
top performing Russia-based DNMs have held steady, but Kraken DNM overtook Mega as the leading
DNM by annual revenue in 2024.

While Mega’s inﬂows declined by more than 50% year-over-year (YoY), Kraken DNM’s rose nearly 68% YoY.
Kraken DNM, which billed itself as Hydra’s Market’s successor, received $737 million on-chain in 2024.

Blacksprut, which rose to prominence with Mega in the wake of Hydra’s 2022 sanctions designation, law
enforcement seizure, and subsequent collapse, came in third with 13.6% less revenue YoY.

As reported last year, some drug shops have been outsourcing services like website hosting and payment
processing. iKlad.biz and Klad.cc, shown in the chart above, are examples of those infrastructure providers.
While these outﬁts are not traditional DNMs, their success highlights how drug vendors are scaling their
operations throughout Russian-speaking countries. In spite of Hydra Market’s disruption in 2022, former
Hydra afﬁliates still found operating in today’s DNMs rely heavily on these infrastructure providers. Last
December, a Russian court imposed a life sentence on Stanislav Moiseyev, Hydra Market’s suspected
founder and operator, although the Moscow prosecutor’s ofﬁce did not publicly tie the guilty verdict to
Hydra. The court also sentenced ﬁfteen accomplices to anywhere from eight to 23 years in
maximum-security penal colonies.

Besides Hydra operators, other DNM administrators faced criminal prosecution in 2024. In March, Incognito
Market’s administrators conducted an exit scam. The FBI tied Taiwanese national Rui-Siang Lin, Incognito’s
operator, to the DNM’s website by tracing crypto transfers to an exchange account in Lin’s name. Lin was
charged with a host of crimes, and by May, federal authorities in New York had arrested him.

Nemesis Market also saw its demise in March, when German authorities seized its infrastructure, along
with $102,000 in cryptocurrency.

As international authorities have disrupted DNMs large and small in the last few years, cybercriminals and
drug dealers have learned ﬁrsthand the consequences of running BTC-accepting DNMs given the
currency’s inherent transparency. Many operators have since moved to accepting only Monero (XMR), a
privacy coin with features designed to boost anonymity and reduce traceability. XMR activity falls outside
the scope of this report.

Darknet market vendors evolve their on-chain behavior

Historically, DNMs have usually cashed out their funds at centralized exchanges (CEXs). Although CEXs
remain a stable destination in the DNM ecosystem, the pattern of sending funds to them shifted in 2024, as
illustrated in the chart below. Last year, DNM vendors sent a signiﬁcantly higher portion of their funds to
DeFi than they did historically. This trend is notable since DNMs operate largely in BTC or privacy coins.
Throughout 2024, DNM vendors also sent far more value to personal wallets and stored funds on-chain.
Retail vendors appear to be holding a greater portion of their proceeds on-chain than wholesale vendors,
while wholesale vendors (those who distribute drugs in large quantities) are making greater use of DeFi.

Darknet market and online pharmacy inﬂows according to drug-purchasing
behaviors

When looking at crypto inﬂows to DNMs in 2024, the data indicate that wholesale drug purchases were
dominant, averaging between 71 and 81% of this year’s total market share. For online pharmacies,
wholesale purchases led in 2024, followed by large retail.

Below are deﬁnitions for DNM purchase categories, based on purchase sizes, from which we infer buyer
intent:

*   **Small retail.** Less than $100, likely made for personal consumption.
*   **Large retail.** Between $100 and $500, also likely made for personal consumption.
*   **Social supply.** Between $500 and $1,000, indicating customers may be sharing drugs with third
    parties in social settings.
*   **Potential wholesale.** Over $1,000, more likely made by drug sellers and distributors.

When examining drug-purchasing habits from DNMs spanning 2020 to 2024, some patterns emerge, in
particular about wholesale activity, that is, purchases likely made by organizations with the intent to
redistribute. First, the major drawdown in DNM wholesale revenue in 2022 can be attributed to the Hydra
Market takedown. Second, while wholesale drug purchasing revenues have steadily climbed since that
drop, they have yet to regain their former highs. This could indicate that:

1.  No DNM since Hydra has established itself as the premier destination for wholesale drug
    purchases.
2.  Global law enforcement operations are becoming increasingly effective in disrupting markets that
    cater to these purchasers.
3.  Sellers and vendors are resorting to other channels, like instant messaging platforms, and/or
    payment methods for illicit drug trade.

As for online pharmacies, these have predominantly catered to wholesale and large retail customers in the
last several years, and 2024 saw growth in wholesale purchases toward the end of last year. Like DNMs,
online pharmacies receive most of their revenues from larger drug resellers.

Abacus Market: Facilitating illicit drug trade

In 2024, Abacus Market was the highest-earning DNM serving Western customers. Last year, Abacus
Market received $43.3 million on-chain.

Since 2021, Abacus Market’s revenue has increased substantially, and in 2024, it more than doubled,
growing by 183.2% YoY. This increase may be due in part to the closures of top DNMs, the shift to the
exclusive acceptance of XMR by other active markets, and delistings of XMR by popular centralized
exchanges. The below graph shows an increase in Abacus sales (in BTC) following the closure of ASAP
Market in July 2023, and a further increase following some CEXs delisting XMR.

Abacus Market has a global presence and broad product offering. Below is a screenshot from the Abacus
Market website showing the range of items it sells, with drugs and chemicals representing the
overwhelming majority of its products.

On Abacus Market, the US, Canada, Germany, Australia, and the UK have the highest number of listings. In
the US, there’s a large diversity in the types of products sold, including counterfeit pills. For example, in the
screenshot below, an American vendor lists protonitazene powder, and advertises its uses as a counterfeit
for oxycodone, also referred to as “M30” (i.e. 30 mg).

While the US market is best characterized by its diverse product offerings, other countries offer regional
specialties. In Colombia, for instance, many of the vendor listings are for cocaine or
Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as seen in the screenshot below.

Some countries have just one or a few vendors with a loyal customer base and a wider selection of goods.
For example, in India, one of the most frequent listings is for generic medication, which mostly comes from
the ﬁrst vendor shown below.

China-based Abacus vendors have many listings for research chemicals. They also sell PMK and BMK,
which are precursors to MDMA and methamphetamine, respectively.

Darknet market connection to Chinese pill press manufacturers

While China-based vendors are frequently referenced as the source of precursors for dangerous synthetic
drugs, their involvement in machinery sales is also an important aspect of the drug supply chain. One
China-based pill press manufacturer which advertises on clearnet business-to-business (B2B) websites
has on-chain ties to drug vendors on Abacus Market. Along with its listings for large pill press machines,
the vendor does not hide the sale of Oxycontin and Xanax TDP die kits, which are used to press counterfeit
pills. The vendor accepts BTC and XMR, and analyzing its on-chain exposure to regional CEXs and DNMs
reveals that it serves customers worldwide, including in the United States, Canada, Sweden, and Russia.
The Reactor graph below shows this vendor’s connection with drug vendors on Abacus Market.

While not all are pictured above, in total, we found 16 vendors either selling or sourcing drug material
