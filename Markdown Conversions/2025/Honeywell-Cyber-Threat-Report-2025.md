## EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

Cybersecurity incidents in the past two quarters
have impacted operational technology (OT)
environments, from transportation sector
disruptions to water critical infrastructure
attacks. Companies faced increasing
cybersecurity and non-compliance risks, as the
data in this latest report details.
Whether ransomware, worm, USB-carried
Trojan virus, or a sentiment-charged attack, the
risks are prevalent and require action. New SEC
regulations to report cybersecurity incidents
only add to the pressure to monitor and defend
quickly. Especially for companies with legacy
infrastructure, as this report reveals, both
historical and new threats need attention.

The two primary challenges are not new: budget constraints and a complex
threat landscape. Yet, it’s a critical time for the industrial OT cybersecurity
domain to leverage cyber-physical and AI-driven methods as threats evolve.
Companies are balancing innovation with economic pressures and navigating
geopolitical tension by assessing their environments and calibrating their
people, process and technology approaches with the latest risk information.
Recent outages across global communications providers and varied sector
attacks only underscore that no matter the size or scale of your organization,
it is always time to better protect your industrial environment.

<a name="changes-in-how-sectors-are-targeted"></a>
### CHANGES IN HOW
SECTORS ARE TARGETED

- Attacks targeting agriculture and food production increased in an exponential pattern.

- Government entities have identified an increase in potential threats for public services:

 » In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that the

drinking water supply for approximately 193 million people is vulnerable to cyberattacks
creating a potential for significant disruptions to public health and safety.[^3]

[^3]: Office of Inspector General, EPA, Cybersecurity Concerns Related
to Drinking Water Systems, November 13, 2024

> Example Incident: In 2024, a large U.S. water and wastewater utility company servicing
14 states was breached, impacting service disruption to several key systems.[^4]

### THE RISK
LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS

The risk landscape remains dynamic even with continuous efforts to mitigate the impacts
breaches and protect ever-interconnected global assets. During the report interval, some
companies doubled down on best practices that would be considered baseline, such as
immutable data back-ups and regularly scheduled vulnerability assessments. In some cases,
these practices prevented significant attack damage. Importantly, it is never too late to start
implementing measures. Companies and organizations can always – and regularly do – increase
security capabilities relative to their own industrial cybersecurity maturity starting point.

### RANSOMWARE, TROJANS
AND USB RISKS

Industrial organizations experienced a notable escalation in threats, particularly from
ransomware attacks targeting operational environments during the report interval. Despite
the absence of new ransomware variants specifically designed for industrial control systems,
existing adversaries continued to disrupt operations across critical sectors. Manufacturing
plants, water treatment facilities, and energy providers faced forced production halts, manual
failovers, and supply chain interruptions due to ransomware-induced shutdowns.

Similarly, well-known risks such as Trojans not only continued to be present but also in
select cases were notably prevalent across the analyzed industrial control system data.
USBs continue to carry various types of worm families with a new one identified.

High-profile breaches underscore vulnerabilities within both public and private sectors and should
prompt a renewed focus on enhancing cybersecurity protocols and incident response strategies.

<a name="threat-types"></a>
### THREAT
TYPES

- User Management and Access Control Attackers: continue to exploit loopholes
in policy administration by looking for high-privilege users, allowed applications
and other legitimate-appearing actions to maliciously enter OT networks

- Ransomware Attackers: continue to exploit organizations for financial gain using

phishing, social engineering and other methods to deploy ransomware.

- Security Systems Attackers: continue to target mechanisms and

systems that are part of a company’s security infrastructure including
patch distribution processes and security update packages.

<a name="opportunities-and-recommendations"></a>
### OPPORTUNITIES AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  Develop or review policies and procedures: Create industrial cybersecurity
policies, procedures, training and educational materials for your organization.
If they already exist, set intervals to review, such as every 15th of the month or
during operational quarterly meetings. Policies and standard operating procedures
(SOPs) can streamline threat identification, detection and response to threats in an
industrial control network and reduce delays and damage when an attack occurs.

> These steps also prepare cross-functional teams and help build
relationships that will be crucial when an attack occurs.

2.  Train employees: Educate employees on how to identify and avoid
phishing attempts and how to maintain good cyber hygiene practices.

3.  Protect against USB threats: Scan removable media like UBSs with
products from approved vendors to help reduce the threat vector
of malware and ransomware from entering the environment.

4.  Use multi-factor authentication: Enable strong passwords and multi-factor
authentication (MFA). Adopt password vaults and push to identify access.

5.  Segment networks: Isolate systems to limit the spread of attacks.Practise
principles of least privilege by granting users, devices and applications only the
access they need to perform their tasks to help lower the potential for a breach.

6.  Deploy Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): Assume no implicit trust between
systems. Verify every user, device and workload accessing your OT environment.
Implement least privilege access, micro segmentation and strong identity
controls. Once these recommendations are standard practice, then trusting
a data view only for advanced process control, predictive maintenance, risk
analysis, operational excellence, advanced threat monitoring becomes  easier.

7.  Update software: Conduct regular system updates to fix vulnerabilities
and integrate with a patch management and update delivery solution.
When operationally feasible, this can identify software update issues and
can impact the integrity of the software operating environment.

8.  Monitor and audit: Monitor and assess security measures using readily
available tools to stay ahead of threats, by visualizing network communications
and taking actions on erroneous operations and communications.

### OPPORTUNITIES AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

9.  Encrypt data: Protect sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.

10. Back up and recover: Protect data integrity and operational continuity
by implementing secure, air-gapped or immutable backups of
critical systems and configurations. Enable point-in-time recovery
and regularly test it in case of ransomware or sabotage.

11. Conduct vulnerability assessments: Execute vulnerability assessments.

12. Label critical assets: Append additional context to asset records
such as which systems are critical and need to be prioritized.

13. Use industry approved standards: Comply with these frameworks
to cover the minimum requirements for security-relevant
aspects for a given industry and secure critical assets:

 » NIST 800-82

 » IEC 62443
 » NERC CIP

14. Create a secure IT/OT Integration: Use cloud services specifically designed to
securely bridge IT and OT. Isolate critical OT systems from direct cloud exposure
and use secure data brokers or gateways for telemetry. Telemetry and Control do
not need to be performed in the same signal or even with the same equipment.
Isolating control away from telemetry provides method to leverage the wave
of new offerings from various AI providers while protecting critical systems.

15. Leverage cloud-native security controls: Take advantage of cloud
provider tools that include native security controls:

 » Identity and access management
 » Logging and moniroting (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure

Defender, GCP Security Command Center)

 » VPC peering
 » Service Level Encryption
 » Vulnerability management tied to CI/CD pipelines.

### DETECTED 107
UNIQUE INCIDENTS

During the reporting period, Honeywell AMIR triaged 54,098 alerts resulting in 1,008 incidents,
and of those, there were 107 unique incidents detected. Let’s review the top four types of
incidents from those 107 events and discuss recommendations for future remediation.

Top Four Types of Incidents:

1. USB plug and play

2. Account was added to a local security group

3. CB-AppControl enforcement level changed from high to low

4. Member was added to a domain controller’s security group

| Incident Name                                               | No. |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 1. USB Plug and Play                                        | 84  |

![Figure 2 Honeywell AMIR Incidents and number of occurances]

2025 Cyber Threat Report   |   www.honeywell.com   |   11

### 1. USB PLUG
AND PLAY

Among the incidents identified by Honeywell AMIR, 25% of the top 10 incidents were triggered
by USB plug and play. A USB plug-and-play incident can pose a significant cybersecurity risk,
especially when an unauthorized or malicious device is connected to a system. For example, an
employee might unknowingly insert an infected USB drive into a corporate computer, triggering
an automatic execution of malware designed to steal sensitive data or deploy ransomware. In a
recent case, a company experienced a security breach when a seemingly harmless promotional
USB stick, distributed at a trade show, contained a hidden payload that installed a keylogger on the
network. Modern operating systems often auto-detect and interact with USB devices without user
intervention, allowing attackers to exploit this feature to execute scripts or alter system settings.

> Recommendation: Endpoint security measures are critical. Disable USB ports when not
needed, implement device control policies, introduce Secure Media Scanning Kiosks, and
educate employees on the dangers of unknown USBs or removeable media devices.

### 2. ACCOUNT ADDED TO
LOCAL SECURITY GROUP

Representing 16% of the Honeywell AMIR recorded top incidents, adding accounts to local
security groups can create security risks because it grants elevated access to a system. Adding
users to privileged groups like “Administrators” can potentially allow unauthorized users to
make critical changes or access to sensitive data if compromised, especially when not managed
centrally through a domain environment. This can be particularly concerning if too many accounts
are added to these groups, leading to excessive permissions and potential for misuse.

> Recommendation: Evaluate what criteria will be used for selecting which accounts constitute
privileged and non-privileged groups. Set up mechanisms to enforce. Regularly audit and
review account lists to look for changes in privilege or newly added privileged accounts.

### 3. REVIEWING CIS BENCHMARKS
FOR WINDOWS ENTERPRISE DESKTOPS

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks are globally recognized security standards
that help organizations defend their IT/OT systems and data from cyberattacks. They are
created by a community of cybersecurity experts, compliance and security professionals. They
create a checklist of best practices that can be applied multiple to different technologies.

The following are examples from the Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise
Benchmark and identified by the Honeywell AMIR team:

2.2.16 Ensure ‘Deny access to this computer from the network’ to include ‘Guests, Local accounts’

2.2.20 Ensure ‘Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services’ to include ‘Guests, Local accounts’

2.3.10.12 Ensure ‘Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts’ is
set to ‘Classic – local users authenticate as themselves’

18.4.1 Ensure ‘Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons’ is set to ‘Enabled’

18.10.4.3 Ensure ‘Prevent the use of security questions for local accounts’ is set to ‘Enabled’

> Recommendation: Keep track of configuration changes and address configuration
drift in programmatic ways as part of a detection-in-depth approach.

2025 Cyber Threat Report   |   www.honeywell.com   |   12

### 3. CB-APPCONTROL ENFORCEMENT LEVEL
CHANGED FROM HIGH TO LOW

Enforcement Level is the protection level applied to computers running the Carbon Black App Control
Agent, specified on a per-policy basis. Enforcement Levels, which vary in restrictiveness, affect how
file actions are controlled for policy settings. File-blocking and other control functions in Carbon
Black App Control depend on both the Enforcement Level and on specific policy settings in effect,
including policy-specific bans. In Control mode, you choose High (Block Unapproved), Low (Monitor
Unapproved), or Medium (Prompt Unapproved) Enforcement Level from a menu. The other modes,
None (Visibility) and None (Disabled), automatically designate the Enforcement Level as None.

Essentially, these incidents declare that a customer is moving from a “White List” approach to
a “Black List” approach inside their environment. This means instead of only allowing approved
files on a “White List” to run, install and launch, now all files are allowed to use all actions
unless there are known bad files on a “Black List” which should not be authorized. Moving
to a Low Enforcement level allows users to be more productive and take on the personal
control of managing security and risk through responsible utilization of file usage.

> Recommendation: Adjust enforcement policies and strategies based on your
unique environment, particularly domain expertise level, and consider use of
application control solutions to track changes. Downgrading from a high to a
lower enforcement level is not typically recommended. Instead, take one of the
following approaches to facilitate the execution of a file that may be blocked by
App Control, especially if the file’s hash is previously unknown to the system.

> Use Publisher and Certificate-based approvals. If the file contains a valid publisher
and a trusted certificate, App Control can permit execution based on this combination.
Configure customized rules such as execution control or file write for files lacking
publisher or certificate information to allow execution in a controlled manner.

### 4. MEMBER WAS ADDED TO A DOMAIN
CONTROLLER’S SECURITY GROUP

Active Directory Users’ and Computers’ "Security Enabled" groups are simply referred to as Security
groups. Active Directory (AD) has two types of groups: Security and Distribution. Security (security
enabled) groups can be used for permissions, rights and as distribution lists. Distribution (security
disabled) groups are for distribution lists in Exchange and cannot be assigned permissions or
rights. Global means the group can be granted access in any trusting domain but may only have
members from its own domain.  This event is only logged on domain controllers. Every user added
to a Domain Controller’s Security Group creates one more vector for attackers to leverage.

> Recommendation: Conduct identity audits to fully understand the number of
assets and resources that members can access or control inside the industrial
control environment to help navigate any potential future incidents.

SMX FINDINGS

<a name="trojans-and-worms-require-constant-updates-through-automated-tools-and-scripts"></a>
### MEASURES AGAINST TROJANS AND WORMS REQUIRE CONSTANT
UPDATES THROUGH AUTOMATED TOOLS AND SCRIPTS.

Hackers will use any means possible to access an industrial control network and do not distinguish
the age of a penetration technique or system vulnerability. This includes worms, Trojans, viruses
and malware of any kind, which can often go completely unnoticed if delivered through a
removable device like a USB or a removeable media device. Trojans and worms require constant
updates through automated tools and scripts to scale defenses to address the level of risk.

Deploying physical controls to assist in policy enforcement can help organizations
manage USB threat risk. Honeywell SMX, which is designed to detect risks in USB
devices, found several notable incidents during the report interval.

### WIN32.WORM.RAMNIT

Thirty-seven percent of files blocked by Honeywell SMX during the report period
contained W32.Worm.Ramnit. This is a 3,000% increase since it was last observed
in Q2 2024. W32.Rmnit is primarily a banking trojan used to steal account credentials;
however, given its saturated presence in Honeywell industrial customers’ ecosystems, it
can likely be assumed it has been repurposed to extract control system credentials.

> Recommendation: Monitor IT network Trojans since they may cross over
into variants deployed in OT networks. Deploy detection rules to monitor for
instances in your organization. See sample rules shared in this report.
