# Minister’s foreword
Minister’s foreword

Cyber threats to Canada are becoming more complex and sophisticated, threatening our national
security and economic prosperity. As a nation with a significant global presence, Canada is a valuable
target for cybercriminals looking to make a profit and state adversaries aiming to disrupt the systems
we rely on.

In the last two years, we have witnessed a sharp increase in both the number and severity of
cyber incidents, many of which target our essential services. Actors outside our borders have also
attempted to influence public opinion and intimidate our population, including in the Canadian
diaspora, through coordinated cyber campaigns.

The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security’s National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026 is an
instrumental tool in our comprehension of cyber threats to Canada. The threat assessment draws on
public reporting and classified intelligence to paint an overall picture of the current threat landscape,
while also forecasting future trends. By offering reliable and timely information, the report empowers
Canadian organizations and individuals to prepare for and defend against current and emerging
threats.

Deepening our understanding of cyber threats enables us to enhance our readiness and, as threats
evolve, the Cyber Centre will continue to look for new ways to combat them. Its team is at the
forefront of enhancing our cyber security to protect Canadians. Our government is supporting
their invaluable work and Budget 2024 allocates $917.4 million to enhance intelligence and cyber
operations programs to respond to evolving national security threats.

The insights provided in this threat assessment are critical as we work to strengthen Canada’s
security in an increasingly digital world.

The Honourable Bill Blair
Minister of National Defence

# Message from the Head of the Cyber Centre
Message from the Head
of the Cyber Centre

It’s hard to believe it’s already been two years since our last report. At first glance, it seems that the
cyber threat environment hasn’t changed much. Cybercrime remains a persistent threat, ransomware
attacks continue to target our critical infrastructure, and state-sponsored cyber threat activity is still
affecting Canadians.

What has changed, however, is that state adversaries are getting bolder and more aggressive.
Cybercriminals driven by profit are increasingly benefiting from new illicit business models to access
malicious tools and are using artificial intelligence to enhance their capabilities. Non-state actors
are seizing on major global conflicts and political controversies to carry out disruptive activities.

These new developments and other trends are outlined in detail in this edition of the National Cyber
Threat Assessment. This year’s report goes further than previous editions, offering more tangible
examples of cyber threat activity in Canada and around the world, as well as providing some of our
own statistics on cyber incidents.

While our assessments describe trends that should concern anyone who reads about them, you
can rest assured that the Cyber Centre remains focused on tackling these threats. Working in close
collaboration with the private sector, industry, government and critical infrastructure, we’re helping
to protect the systems that are vital to our daily lives.

Whether you’re a first-time reader or an avid consumer, an individual Canadian or a member of a
small, medium or large organization, I’m confident that you will find the information in this report
insightful. I hope that it also encourages you to reflect on what you can do to contribute to our
collective resilience. After all, we all have a role to play in building a safer, more secure Canada.

Sincerely,

Rajiv Gupta
Head, Canadian Centre for Cyber Security

# Executive summary
Executive summary

Canada is confronting an expanding and complex cyber threat landscape with a growing cast
of malicious and unpredictable state and non-state cyber threat actors, from cybercriminals to
hacktivists, that are targeting our critical infrastructure and endangering our national security. These
cyber threat actors are evolving their tradecraft, adopting new technologies, and collaborating in an
attempt to improve and amplify their malicious activities.

Canada’s state adversaries are becoming more aggressive in cyberspace. State-sponsored cyber
operations against Canada and our allies almost certainly extend beyond espionage. State-
sponsored cyber threat actors are almost certainly attempting to cause disruptive effects, such as
denying service, deleting or leaking data, and manipulating industrial control systems, to support
military objectives and/or information campaigns. We assess that our adversaries very likely
consider civilian critical infrastructure to be a legitimate target for cyber sabotage in the event of a
military conflict.

At the same time, cybercrime remains a persistent, widespread, and disruptive threat to individuals,
organizations, and all levels of government across Canada that is sustained by a thriving and
resilient global cybercrime ecosystem. We assess that the financial motivations underpinning
cybercrime will almost certainly drive the cybercrime ecosystem to continuously evolve and diversify
as cybercriminals attempt to evade authorities.

## Key judgements
- Canada’s state adversaries are using cyber operations to disrupt and divide. State-sponsored
cyber threat actors are almost certainly combining disruptive computer network attacks with
online information campaigns to intimidate and shape public opinion. State-sponsored cyber
threat actors are very likely targeting critical infrastructure networks in Canada and allied
countries to pre-position for possible future disruptive or destructive cyber operations.

- The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) expansive and aggressive cyber program presents the
most sophisticated and active state cyber threat to Canada today. The PRC conducts cyber
operations against Canadian interests to serve high-level political and commercial objectives,
including espionage, intellectual property (IP) theft, malign influence, and transnational
repression. Among our adversaries, the PRC cyber program’s scale, tradecraft, and ambitions in
cyberspace are second to none.

- Russia’s cyber program furthers Moscow’s ambitions to confront and destabilize Canada
and our allies. Canada is very likely a valuable espionage target for Russian state-sponsored
cyber threat actors, including through supply chain compromises, given Canada’s membership
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, support for Ukraine against Russian aggression, and
presence in the Arctic. Pro-Russia non-state actors, some of which we assess likely have links
to the Russian government, are targeting Canada in an attempt to influence our foreign policy.

- Iran uses its cyber program to coerce, harass, and repress its opponents, while managing
escalation risks. Iran’s increasing willingness to conduct disruptive cyber attacks beyond
the Middle East and its persistent efforts to track and monitor regime opponents through
cyberspace present a growing cyber security challenge for Canada and our allies.

- The Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) business model is almost certainly contributing to the
continued resilience of cybercrime in Canada and around the world. The CaaS ecosystem is
underpinned by flourishing online marketplaces where specialized cyber threat actors sell stolen
and leaked data and ready-to-use malicious tools to other cybercriminals. This has almost
certainly enabled a growing number of actors with a range of capabilities and expertise to carry
out cybercrime attacks and evade law enforcement detection.

- Ransomware is the top cybercrime threat facing Canada’s critical infrastructure. Ransomware
directly disrupts critical infrastructure entities’ ability to deliver critical services, which can put
the physical and emotional wellbeing of victims in jeopardy. In the next two years, ransomware
actors will almost certainly escalate their extortion tactics and refine their capabilities to
increase pressure on victims to pay ransoms and evade law enforcement detection.

# About this threat assessment
About this threat assessment

The National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026 (NCTA 2025-2026) highlights the cyber threats facing individuals
and organizations in Canada. It provides an update to the National Cyber Threat Assessment 2018[^1] (NCTA 2018), the
National Cyber Threat Assessment 2020[^2] (NCTA 2020), and the National Cyber Threat Assessment 2023-2024[^3] (NCTA
2023-2024), with analysis of the interim years and forecasts until 2026. We recommend reading the NCTA 2025-2026
along with the Introduction to the Cyber Threat Environment[^4] and the advice and guidance that we have released as
companions to this assessment.

We prepared this assessment to help Canadians shape and sustain our nation’s cyber resilience. It is only when the
government, the private sector, and the public work together that we can build resilience to cyber threats in Canada.

## Sources
Our cyber threat assessments
are based on an assessment
methodology that includes evaluating
the quality of available information,
exploring alternative explanations,
mitigating biases, and using
probabilistic language. We use the
terms “we assess” or “we judge” to
convey an analytic assessment.
We use qualifiers such as “possibly,”
“likely,” and “very likely” to
convey probability.

## Assessment process
The key judgements in this
assessment rely on reporting from
multiple sources, both classified
and unclassified. The judgements
are based on CSE’s knowledge and
expertise in cyber security. Defending
the Government of Canada’s
information systems provides
CSE with a unique perspective to
observe trends in the cyber threat
environment, which also informs
our assessment. CSE’s foreign
intelligence mandate provides us
with valuable insights into adversary
behaviour in cyberspace. While
we must always protect classified
sources and methods, we provide the
reader with as much justification as
possible for our judgements.

## Limitations
This threat assessment is based
on information available as of
September 20, 2024.

This assessment does not provide
an exhaustive list of all cyber threat
activity in Canada or mitigation
advice. The purpose of this threat
assessment is to describe and
evaluate the threats facing Canada.
We focus on understanding the
current cyber threat environment
and how threat activity can
affect Canadians and Canadian
organizations. Cyber security
guidance can be found on the Cyber
Centre website and on the Get Cyber
Safe website.[^5]

# Introduction
Introduction

Canada has entered a new era of cyber vulnerability where cyber threats are ever-present, and Canadians will increasingly
feel the impact of cyber incidents that have cascading and disruptive effects on their daily lives.

Advancements in communications and computing technologies have ushered in a world of ubiquitous connectivity for
Canadians. In this environment, online platforms and digital technologies continue to shape and mediate Canadians’
interactions with the physical world—the way we work, shop, travel, socialize, get informed, and access critical services.[^6]
These systems record and process vast amounts of data about us, often over poorly secured or untrustworthy digital
networks.[^7] These systems are also interconnected and fragile: cyber incidents, from cyber attacks to flawed software
updates, can knock airlines, hospitals, banks, and retailers around the world offline.[^8]

CSE and its partners in Canada and across the Five Eyes are attuned to the cyber threats to Canada from state and non-
state cyber threat actors and are tracking them as they evolve. NCTA 2025-2026 provides the Canadian public with CSE’s
current insights on the state and non-state cyber threat actors conducting malicious cyber threat activity against Canada
and how we assess the cyber threat landscape will evolve in the next two years. This assessment is divided into three
sections that are designed to stand independently and together.

- Section 1—Cyber threat from state adversaries: introduces the state cyber threat ecosystem and discusses the
cyber threats to Canada from
  - the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
  - the Russian Federation (Russia)
  - the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran)
  - the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)
  - the Republic of India (India)

- Section 2—Cybercrime threats: discusses the interconnectivity of the Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) ecosystem
and the cybercrime threats facing Canada, specifically from fraud, scams, and ransomware. This section also
highlights the ransomware threat to Canada’s critical infrastructure.

- Section 3—Trends shaping Canada’s cyber threat landscape: identifies five trends that will shape Canada’s cyber
threat landscape and drive cyber threat activity impacting Canadians up to 2026.

Readers interested in more detailed information on the evolving cyber threat landscape, including definitions of important
terms and concepts referenced in this NCTA, are invited to consult the following:

# Cyber threat from state adversaries
Cyber threat from state adversaries

Canada is confronting an expanding and more complex state cyber ecosystem

Strategic adversaries

Emerging cyber programs

Wider cyber ecosystem

The cyber programs of the PRC,
Russia, and Iran remain the greatest
strategic cyber threats to Canada.
These countries are united in their
desire to challenge United States
(U.S.) dominance in multiple
domains, including cyberspace,
and promote an authoritarian
vision for Internet governance and
domestic surveillance.[^12] The PRC’s
cyber program surpasses other
hostile states in both the scope and
resources dedicated to cyber threat
activity against Canada.

At the same time, countries that
aspire to become new centres of
power within the global system,
such as India, are building cyber
programs that present varying
levels of threat to Canada.[^13] While
emerging states focus their cyber
efforts on domestic threats and
regional rivals, they also use their
cyber capabilities to track and
surveil activists and dissidents
living abroad.

Both advanced and emerging states
are leveraging a complex ecosystem
of commercial surveillance vendors,
contractors, and affiliated research
institutions to support or perform
cyber threat activities (Figure 1).[^14]
States use these entities to mask
their cyber operations or to acquire
exploits, digital infrastructure, and
data. Emerging states are very
likely using the wider ecosystem
to try and move up the ladder
of sophistication and acquire
capabilities that may be beyond
their capacity to develop internally.

![Figure 1: State cyber program ecosystem]

## People’s Republic of China
People’s Republic of China

The PRC presents the most sophisticated and active cyber threat to Canada

The PRC’s expansive and aggressive cyber program has global cyber surveillance, espionage, and attack capabilities
and is the most comprehensive cyber security threat facing Canada today. Canada, along with our Five Eyes partners,
is an ongoing target for the PRC’s cyber program. The PRC conducts cyber operations against Canadian interests to
serve high-level political and commercial objectives, including espionage, IP theft, malign influence, and transnational
repression. Among our adversaries, the PRC cyber program’s scale, tradecraft, and ambitions in cyberspace are second
to none.

The PRC targets all levels of government and public officials for valuable intelligence

PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actors persistently conduct cyber
espionage against federal, provincial, territorial, municipal, and Indigenous
government networks in Canada. PRC cyber threat actors have compromised
and maintained access to multiple government networks over the past five
years, collecting communications and other valuable information.[^16] While all
known federal government compromises have been resolved, it is very likely
that the actors responsible for these intrusions dedicated significant time and
resources to learn about the target networks.

PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actors also target Canadian government
officials, particularly individuals that the PRC perceives as being critical of
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). According to a U.S. Department of
Justice indictment, in 2021, PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actors targeted
members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), a group of
global lawmakers whose stated purpose is to counter the threats posed by the
CCP to the international order and democratic principles. The threat actors
sent email messages with tracking images to recipients to conduct network
reconnaissance (see Figure 2).[^17] A number of Canadian politicians who are
members of IPAC have come forward to confirm that they were targeted in
this operation.[^18]

Over the past four
years, at least
20 networks
associated with
Government
of Canada agencies
and departments
have been
compromised by
PRC cyber
threat actors.

![Figure 2: PRC email operation against members of Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China]

The PRC targets Canadian government networks and public officials to acquire
information that will advance its strategic, economic, and diplomatic interests,
and give the PRC government an advantage in China-Canada bilateral relations
and commercial matters. For example, provincial and territorial governments
are likely a valuable target given that they have decision-making power over
regional trade and commerce, including resource extraction (e.g., energy and
critical minerals).[^19] In addition to fulfilling PRC intelligence collection priorities,
the information collected is also likely used to support the PRC’s malign
influence and interference activities against Canada’s democratic processes
and institutions.

PRC cyber threat activity against Canada appears to intensify following events
that increase bilateral tensions between Canada and the PRC. In this context,
PRC cyber threat activity is likely designed to gather timely intelligence on
official reactions and to monitor unfolding developments.

PRC cyber-enabled transnational repression targets individuals
in Canada

PRC cyber threat actors very likely support China’s actions abroad designed to
silence activists, journalists, diaspora communities, and other groups that the
PRC views as security threats. These groups, collectively referred to by PRC
officials as the “Five Poisons,” include:

- Falun Gong practitioners
- Uyghurs
- Tibetans
- supporters of Taiwanese independence
- pro-democracy activists

PRC actors very likely facilitate transnational repression by monitoring and
harassing these groups online and tracking them using cyber surveillance.[^20]
For example, the PRC has been publicly linked to cyber espionage operations
against the Uyghur minority group, including members living in Canada, using
spear phishing emails and spyware.[^21]

The PRC government very likely leverages Chinese-owned technology
platforms, some of which likely cooperate with the PRC’s intelligence and
security services, to facilitate transnational repression.[^22]

The PRC targets Canada’s private sector and innovation ecosystem
for competitive advantage

Canada’s innovation ecosystem has been a long-standing priority of PRC
intelligence collection. The PRC cyber program almost certainly continues
to support the PRC’s espionage activities against Canada’s private sector,
academia, supply chains, and government-affiliated research and development
(R&D). PRC cyber threat actors have very likely stolen commercially sensitive
data from Canadian firms and institutions.

The PRC uses cyber contractors and freelancers to support espionage

The PRC uses a competitive marketplace of contract and freelance cyber actors to support the PRC’s intelligence
collection requirements. For example, I-Soon is a PRC-based private contractor that provides “hacker-for-hire”
services. According to leaked documents, the company worked on projects on a contractual basis for various PRC
government and military entities and state-owned enterprises. I-Soon reportedly sold exfiltrated data from targets
to its clients.[^23]

PRC cyber threat actors targeting Canada likely prioritize collecting confidential and proprietary information that supports
the PRC’s economic and military interests and that can help accelerate the PRC’s development of advanced and strategic
technologies (Figure 3). The PRC will likely intensify its espionage activities against Canada’s innovation sector as
economic tensions between the PRC and Canada (and our allies) rise.[^24]

![Figure 3: Future industries “iconic products” identified as priorities for PRC industrial policy (2024)]

PRC pre-positioning within United States critical infrastructure increases risk to Canada

In a strategic shift, the PRC is very likely integrating offensive cyber operations into its military planning to gain an
advantage during a potential conflict with the U.S. PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actors, tracked as Volt Typhoon,
are almost certainly seeking to pre-position within U.S. critical infrastructure networks for disruptive or destructive cyber
attacks in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the U.S. According to U.S. officials, the PRC’s operation is designed
to slow the U.S. military’s response and to sow societal panic.[^26] Volt Typhoon is especially noteworthy because the PRC
has not historically conducted disruptive or destructive cyber operations against critical infrastructure.[^27]

We assess that the direct threat to Canada’s critical infrastructure from PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actors is likely
lower than that to U.S. infrastructure. While the focus of future PRC cyber warfare operations will likely be concentrated
on the U.S., disruptive or destructive cyber threat activity against integrated North American critical infrastructure, such
as pipelines, power grids, and rail lines, would likely affect Canada as well due to cross-border interoperability
and interdependence.[^28]

## Russian Federation
Russian Federation

Russia is leveraging its cyber program to confront the West

Russia’s unpredictable cyber program routinely challenges existing norms in cyberspace and furthers Moscow’s
ambitions to confront and destabilize Canada and our allies.

Russia almost certainly views its cyber program as part of a multi-layered strategy to influence and shape the information
environment. Russia combines conventional cyber espionage and computer network attacks with disinformation and
influence operations to:[^29]

- promote Russia’s global status and reinforce pro-Russia narratives
- erode trust in democratic institutions
- generate popular support for Russia’s war efforts, both at home and abroad
- psychologically weaken or embarrass its opponents

Russia’s cyber threat activities are supported by a network of state and non-state cyber actors, including an ever-shifting
group of Russia-nexus cybercriminals, hacktivists, and “hackers-for-hire” who are likely motivated by a mix of patriotism,
profit, or opportunism. This hybrid strategy, which provides Russia with deniability, appears to have been emulated by
other states, creating a more complex cyber threat environment for Canada and our allies.[^30] [^31]

Russian cyber threat actor conducts destructive cyber attack
against Ukraine for psychological effects

In December 2023, a Russian cyber threat actor conducted a destructive wiper cyber attack against the Ukrainian
telecom company Kyivstar, leaving millions of Ukrainians without Internet and mobile service for days. The
cyber threat actor was reportedly in Kyivstar’s systems since at least May 2023 and may have been able to steal
subscriber information and intercept SMS messages. The actor claimed credit for the attack in a Telegram post
addressed to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to Ukrainian officials, the aim of the destructive
attack was to land a psychological blow against Ukraine.[^31]

Russia targets Canada for espionage

Canada is very likely a valuable espionage target for Russian state-sponsored cyber threat actors given Canada’s
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, support for Ukraine, and presence in the Arctic. Russian cyber
threat actors are very likely targeting Canadian government, military, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks as
part of Russia’s foreign and military intelligence collection operations.[^32]

Public and private sector organizations in Canada are also vulnerable to global supply chain compromises by Russian
cyber threat actors. For example, in 2020, Russian state-sponsored cyber threat actors compromised the supply-chain
by implanting malware into a SolarWinds software update.[^33] Russian-state-sponsored cyber threat actors are almost
certainly targeting cloud-based services with large numbers of customers in Canada.[^34]

Russian cyber threat actors compromise
Microsoft corporate email system
for espionage

In January 2024, Microsoft detected that a Russian state-sponsored
cyber threat actor publicly tracked by Microsoft as Midnight Blizzard
had breached Microsoft’s cloud-based enterprise email service.
Midnight Blizzard accessed Microsoft’s own corporate email accounts,
exfiltrating correspondences between Microsoft and government
officials in Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom.[^35] According
to Microsoft, the Russian cyber threat actor was initially seeking
information about itself.[^36] The threat actor later used personal data
and credentials in the emails to attempt to gain access to Microsoft
customer systems.

Pro-Russia non-state cyber threat actors target Canada to influence
our foreign policy

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, pro-Russia non-state (PRNS)
cyber threat actors, some of which we assess likely have links to the Russian
government and intelligence services, have almost certainly conducted
disruptive cyber threat activity against Canada and leveraged social media to
draw attention to these attacks (Figure 4).[^37] We assess that the intent of these
campaigns is very likely to influence and undermine Canada’s support for
Ukraine. For example, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack campaign in
April 2023 by PRNS actors against Government of Canada and Canadian private
sector websites coincided with the Ukrainian Prime Minister’s visit to Canada.[^38]

Although PRNS cyber threat activity against Canada has primarily consisted
of DDoS attacks and website defacements, some PRNS actors have
attempted to compromise operational technology (OT) systems within critical
infrastructure in North America and Europe with the intent to disrupt those
systems. This activity opportunistically targets Internet-accessible devices
and exploits basic vulnerabilities, such as insecure remote access software
or the use of default passwords.[^39] For example, in January 2024, a PRNS
group claimed responsibility for the overflow of water storage tanks at water
facilities in Texas. The group reportedly posted a video of the compromise and
manipulation of control systems at each facility on a public forum.[^40]

We assess that PRNS actors will likely attempt to disrupt vulnerable Internet-
connected OT systems within Canadian critical infrastructure when the
opportunity arises. PRNS cyber threat activity against OT may cause systems
to malfunction, leading to damage or destruction of those systems and
possible harm to public safety.

![Figure 4: Notable examples of pro-Russia non-state cyber threat activity against Canada (2023)]

## Islamic Republic of Iran
Islamic Republic of Iran

Iran is expanding its disruptive cyber threat activity against the West

Iran has an aggressive cyber program that the regime uses to coerce, harass, and repress Iran’s opponents, while
managing escalation risks. Iran’s increasing willingness to conduct disruptive cyber attacks beyond the Middle East,
and its persistent efforts to track and monitor regime opponents through cyberspace present a growing cyber security
challenge for Canada and our allies.

Iran has taken advantage of its back-and-forth cyber confrontation with Israel to improve its cyber espionage and
offensive cyber capabilities and hone its information campaigns, which it is now almost certainly deploying against
targets in the West.[^42] While it is unlikely that Canada is, at present, a priority target of Iran’s cyber program, Iranian cyber
threat actors likely have access to computer networks in Canada, including critical infrastructure.

Iran’s global coercive cyber operations present a risk to Canada

Iranian state-sponsored cyber threat actors have planned and conducted multi-stage disruptive cyber operations
around the world to intimidate Iran’s opponents, signal the regime’s displeasure, and persuade a country to change its
behaviour (Figure 5).[^43]

Iranian cyber threat actors have performed denial of service attacks, attempted to manipulate industrial control systems,
and accessed government and private networks to encrypt, wipe, and leak data. Iran has developed a network of
hacktivist personas and social media channels that exploit these disruptive events to spread the regime’s messages and
influence the target society while keeping Tehran’s official involvement ambiguous and deniable.[^44]

We assess that escalation of tensions in Canada-Iran bilateral relations would very likely increase the risk that Canada
would be a target of Iranian coercive cyber operations.

![Figure 5: Coercive cyber operations publicly linked to Iran (2021-2023)]

Iran uses social engineering for transnational repression and espionage

Iranian state-sponsored cyber threat actors likely track and monitor individuals in Canada whom the Iranian regime
considers a threat, such as political activists, journalists, human rights researchers, and members of the Iranian diaspora.
Iranian cyber threat groups are particularly sophisticated in combining social engineering with spear phishing to support
Iran’s transnational repression and surveillance activities (Figure 6).[^46] For example, Iran has very likely used the downing
of Flight 752 over Tehran as a thematic lure for its social engineering and spear phishing operations. These efforts are
especially concerning given recent public reports linking Iran to kidnapping and assassination plots against regime
opponents living in the West.[^47]

![Figure 6: Elements of an Iranian social engineering campaign]

Iran also uses its social engineering efforts to target public officials and gain access to government networks and private
sector organizations globally, including in the aerospace, energy, defence, travel, and telecommunications sectors, in
pursuit of its intelligence collection requirements.[^48]

## The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

The DPRK has a dual-purpose cyber program that prioritizes revenue generation alongside the pursuit of the regime’s
strategic and intelligence requirements. DPRK state-sponsored cyber threat actors routinely engage in cybercrime
activities, such as ransomware and cryptocurrency theft, to fund the regime’s political and military ambitions as well
as the cyber program’s own operations.[^49] These financially motivated attacks are very likely conducted under the
overarching strategic direction and protection of the North Korean regime, which likely tolerates cybercrime activities that
have harmful and disruptive effects.[^50]

While we assess that the DPRK’s cyber program almost certainly does not pose a strategic cyber threat to Canada on par
with countries like the PRC and Russia, the regime’s commitment to cybercriminal statecraft almost certainly presents
a persistent and well-resourced cybercrime threat to individuals and organizations in Canada across a broad range of
industries and sectors of the economy. The DPRK will almost certainly continue to adapt and pivot to new cybercriminal
enterprises as digital technologies evolve.[^51]

India’s leadership almost certainly aspires to build a modernized cyber program with domestic cyber capabilities.[^52] India
very likely uses its cyber program to advance its national security imperatives, including espionage, counterterrorism,
and the country’s efforts to promote its global status and counter narratives against India and the Indian government. We
assess that India’s cyber program likely leverages commercial cyber vendors to enhance its operations.[^53]

We assess that Indian state-sponsored cyber threat actors likely conduct cyber threat activity against Government of
Canada networks for the purpose of espionage. We judge that official bilateral relations between Canada and India will very
likely drive Indian state-sponsored cyber threat activity against Canada.

Interconnected online cybercrime ecosystem
facilitates Cybercrime-as-a-Service

Financially motivated and opportunistic cybercrime continues to be the
cyber threat activity that is most likely to affect Canadians and Canadian
organizations. We judge that the continued resilience of cybercrime in
Canada and around the world is almost certainly due, in part, to the rise of the
Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) business model. With CaaS, specialized threat
actors sell stolen and leaked data and ready-to-use malicious tools to other
cybercriminals online, enabling their illicit activities.[^54]

CaaS services available online
for cybercriminals to purchase

- Malware-as-a-Service: services to support the development and
deployment of malware that can steal or encrypt victim data or gain
remote control of victim systems

- Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS): a core group of developers will
sell or lease their ransomware variant to other threat actors, called
affiliates; the core developers will support affiliates’ deployment of
their ransomware in exchange for upfront payment, subscription
fees, a cut of profits, or all three

- Access-as-a-Service: specialized threat actors gain access to
victim systems and sell access to compromised systems to clients

- Phishing-as-a-Service (PaaS): detailed instructions, email
templates, and ready-to-use tools for executing phishing attacks

- DDoS-as-a-Service:
