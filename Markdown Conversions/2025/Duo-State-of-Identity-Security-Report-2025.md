2025 State of
Identity Security:
Challenges and
Strategies from IT
and Security Leaders

New Cisco Duo survey finds that 85% of
companies are adopting security-first identity
practices to counter AI-driven threats.

## Introduction

The increasing adoption of remote work,
cloud-first operations, and distributed supply
chain networks has rapidly evolved identity
from a tactical IT consideration to a strategic
pillar of cybersecurity. In a world where AI-
driven threats and sophisticated phishing
attacks are redefining security requirements,
strong identity and access management
(IAM) is no longer optional—it’s essential.

Cisco Duo’s latest study surveyed 650
Security and IT leaders across North
America and Europe to uncover the stark
realities and hidden vulnerabilities of today’s
identity security postures.

## Highlights

### Facing an Identity Crisis

Whether it’s the challenge of managing
identities across multiple systems or the
strain of resolving issues with separate tools,
the data highlights that disjointed processes
and legacy infrastructure are holding

organizations back. Only 33% of leaders
are confident in the security their identity
provider offers.

### Phishing Resistance in a New Threat Era

AI-driven phishing, identity spoofing, and
insider risks are changing how organizations
view authentication and authorization.
Amongst security professionals, 87% agree
that phishing-resistant MFA is critical, but
just 19% have fully implemented FIDO2
tokens. That’s a major disconnect between
awareness and execution.

### A Need for Security-first Identity

Yet, the momentum is shifting. 82% of
financial decision-makers are increasing
identity security budgets and 85% are
adopting security-first identity strategies to
counter AI-driven threats.

## Facing Complexity and
a Confidence Crisis

From legacy tool sprawl to device
and posture visibility, leaders
anticipate significant challenges
as identity threats escalate and
security gaps widen. Security-first
Identity becomes a priority.

## Confidence in Identity
Providers is Worryingly Low

Despite the foundational role identity providers (IdPs)
play in access control, confidence in their ability to stop
identity-based attacks remains strikingly low.

33%

of security leaders
are confident their identity provider protects
against identity-based attacks.

## ISPM Tools Are
Underutilized

Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) offers a
strategic framework for enforcing policy and improving
security outcomes—but adoption is lagging.

32%

believe they have a fully
effective Identity Security
Posture Management
solution.

WHY THIS MATTERS: A lack of confidence is heightened
by complex identity systems and concerns about limited
visibility into potential weaknesses.

TO DO: Evaluate current ISPM capabilities against known
frameworks and prioritize gap remediation. Regular
identity security posture checks can help identify high-
impact recommendations tailored to the organization.

74% admit security is an afterthought.

## Identity Security Often
Comes Too Late

Security often enters the conversation after
core infrastructure decisions have been made—
creating persistent misalignment between
architecture and risk mitigation.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Modern identity solutions
must have security functionality by default, not
as an expensive add-on.

74%

of IT leaders admit identity security is often
an afterthought in infrastructure planning.

97%

value identity and device
telemetry, but only 52%
have it fully integrated.

## Telemetry is Valued
but Incomplete

Nearly all security leaders understand
the strategic importance of identity and
device telemetry—but integration into
daily operations is inconsistent.

TO DO: Invest in solutions that
unify and operationalize telemetry
data across platforms.

6

## Visibility Into Identity
is Fragmented

Lack of visibility into identity risk—especially
privileged access and dormant accounts—
remains a critical vulnerability.

69%

lack full visibility into
identity vulnerabilities, and
55% into admin access.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Unseen identities and
privileged accounts are high-risk blind spots.

## Complexity Is the
Core Issue

From policy enforcement to incident response,
identity-related complexity is undermining security
fundamentals across the board.

94%

say complexity in identity infrastructure
challenges security posture.

KEY INSIGHT:

Simplification should be a top

architectural goal.

With only 33% confident in their identity
provider, can you risk standing still?

Modern identity providers should feel
simple, secure, scalable. Learn how to
manage identities from day one.

7

2025 State of Identity Security

## ITDR Is Held Back by
Deployment Friction

Identity Threat Detection & Response
(ITDR) solutions are a rising priority, but
complexity, scalability, and integration
concerns are stalling rollout.

Top barriers include:

39%

Complexity

39%

Scale

36%

Integration

KEY INSIGHT: Technical and operational complexity
outweighs financial barriers in ITDR deployment.

## Identity Sprawl
is Unchecked

The average enterprise identity is now
spread across nearly five separate systems,
introducing friction and increasing the
attack surface.

Identities are stored
in an average of

4.8
systems.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Dispersed
identity data hampers unified security
enforcement, and makes visibility
across identity providers challenging.

## Persistent Phishing
Threats & MFA Gaps

Advancing identity-based attacks
drive a need for deployable end-to-
end phishing resistance that doesn’t
compromise on usability.

## MFA Gaps and
Phishing Resistance

### MFA Still Incomplete

Many organizations still lack full MFA coverage
across devices and applications, creating
persistent vulnerabilities.

69%

are worried that MFA isn’t
deployed across all devices and apps.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Gaps in MFA due to complex
deployment, inconsistent coverage, and additional
costs are a leading vectors of identity-based attack.
Incomplete MFA coverage is a critical risk vector.

### The Biggest Phishing
Resistance Hurdles

Leaders agree that phishing-resistant MFA is critical—
but operational friction remains a major barrier to scale.

87%

prioritize phishing-resistant MFA, but only
30% feel confident in their phishing controls.

Token management

Extra training/support

Hardware token cost

Compatibility issues

Only 2% say there’s no business need

57%

53%

47%

45%

Stay ahead of credential-
based attacks. See how to
start the journey towards a
passwordless future today.

KEY INSIGHT:

Resistance stems from operational

burdens, not lack of demand.

10

2025 State of Identity Security

## Passwordless is a Goal,
Not Yet a Reality

Despite clear support for passwordless access,
legacy integration and workforce readiness
remain major hurdles.

### FIDO2 Adoption is Low

Hardware tokens offer strong phishing
resistance, yet full implementation of FIDO2
remains rare suggesting resource and
prioritization gaps.

61%want to move to passwordless

access, but expect challenges.

KEY INSIGHT: The future is
passwordless, but retrofitting
legacy systems is the delay.

19%

Only
of teams have fully implemented FIDO2 tokens.

TO DO: Assess hardware token fit for high-risk user groups.
Evaluate phishing-resistant authentication methods that don’t
require additional investments, like proximity-based verification.

Usability shouldn’t be a trade-off for security.

Eliminate login fatigue with a seamless access
experience that doesn’t require extra hardware.
Get phishing-resistant MFA that is easy to deploy.

11

2025 State of Identity Security

## A Need for
Security-First IAM

Treating security as an add-on
can result in additional costs,
complexity, and misalignment that
decreases overall visibility. Modern
IAM protects the expanded identity
perimeter and prioritizes security
from the start.

## Integrated Solutions
Are Essential

As multi-cloud adoption rises, tool
interoperability has become non-negotiable
for efficient and secure identity operations.

76%

say identity tools must
integrate with AWS,
Microsoft, and Google.

TO DO: Prioritize platform-agnostic or
extensible solutions in procurement.

## Third-Party and Insider
Threats Are Growing

The perimeter has expanded—and most organizations
are underprepared to manage access and risk from
contractors and internal actors.

86%are worried about inadequate contractor

controls. 57% reported unauthorized access.

TO DO: Deploy tailored access and monitoring solutions for
external identities. Consider storing third-party or temporary
identities in a separate user directory that enables easy
provisioning, deprovisioning, and granular access controls.

13

enforcement. Enforce security patches and get visibility into device
health on all accessing devices—managed or unmanaged.

## Top Identity
Threats for 2025

Security leaders are preparing
for a new wave of threats
driven by AI, insider misuse,
and increasingly sophisticated
credential theft.

AI-driven phishing, insider
threats, and supply chain
attacks top the list.

KEY INSIGHT:

Threats are

diversifying, but insider and AI
threats dominate risk assessments.

14

2025 State of Identity Security

## Vendor Consolidation
is Gaining Ground

Tool proliferation is creating operational drag—

consolidation as a path to simplification and clarity.

79%are exploring it to improve

identity security visibility.

KEY INSIGHT: Identity consolidation is about
strategic simplification, not just savings.

## Security Investment is Rising

With budgets increasing, identity leaders have a critical window
to accelerate modernization and close long-standing gaps.

82%

of financial decision-makers have
increased budgets for identity security.

KEY INSIGHT: Security teams have momentum—
now’s the time to push forward critical initiatives.

## Financial Impact of
Identity Failures

The cost of identity breaches is no longer
theoretical—more than half of surveyed organizations
have suffered measurable financial damage.

51%

of organizations have
suffered financial losses
due to identity breaches.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Identity risk isn’t theoretical—it hits the bottom line.
