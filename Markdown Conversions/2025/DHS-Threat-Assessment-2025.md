## Scope Note
The Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security presents the 2025
Homeland Threat Assessment, which provides insights from across the Department and other
homeland security stakeholders to identify the most direct, pressing threats to our Homeland during
the next fiscal year (FY). This Assessment organizes evolving threats to homeland security missions
arising from the dynamic terrorist threat, the increasing complexities straining the immigration
system, transnational organized crime, proliferating cyber threats, and geopolitical strategic
competition into four sections: Public Safety and Security, Border and Immigration Security, Critical
Infrastructure Security, and Economic Security. This Assessment employs a traditional intelligence
assessment format in which summary assessment paragraphs are followed by bullets with additional
details that underpin the assessment.

We note that many of the threat actors and efforts addressed in this Assessment appear in multiple
sections as they cut across mission areas and interact in complex and, at times, reinforcing ways.
Throughout this Assessment, we also examine enduring issues, such as the development and proliferation
of new technologies and climate change, which involve various mission areas and impact multiple
threats. Definitions for terms and additional contextual notes are included at the end of this document.

## Executive Summary
The Homeland faces a complex set of threats to our public safety, border security, critical
infrastructure, and economy from violent extremists, transnational criminal organizations (TCOs),
adversarial nation-states, and malicious cyber actors. These threats, while varied in scope and
intended purpose, at times compound one another in unexpected ways, harming our communities
and generating costly disruptions to the US economy. Meanwhile, technological advances, climate
change, and natural disasters have the potential to exacerbate many of the aforementioned threats.

### PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY: Over the next year, the terrorism threat environment in the
Homeland will remain high. We are particularly concerned about a confluence of factors this year,
including violent extremist responses to domestic sociopolitical developments—especially the 2024
election cycle—and international events that domestic and foreign violent extremists likely will use
to justify or encourage attacks in the Homeland. Lone offenders and small groups continue to pose
the greatest threat of carrying out attacks with little to no warning. Meanwhile, foreign terrorist
organizations (FTOs) and their supporters will maintain their enduring intent to conduct or inspire
attacks in the Homeland.

In addition, the production, trafficking, and sale of illegal drugs by transnational and domestic criminal
actors will continue to pose the most lethal threat to communities in the United States. Fentanyl and
other synthetic opioids remain the most lethal of drugs trafficked into the country, but small increases
in overdoses linked to cocaine and methamphetamine highlight the danger from other drug types.

Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

We expect the Homeland also will face threats to public safety from state actors using subversive
tactics in an effort to influence and divide the American public and undermine confidence in our
institutions. Many of these actors—in particular, the People’s Republic of China (PRC)—also target
ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, and journalists in the United States to silence and
harass critical voices, violating our sovereignty and the rule of law.

The 2024 election cycle will be an attractive target for many adversaries. Some domestic violent
extremists (DVEs) likely view a wide range of targets indirectly and directly associated with
elections as viable targets for violence with the intent of instilling fear among voters, candidates,
and election workers, as well as disrupting election processes leading up to and after the November
election. Nation-state-aligned foreign malign influence actors almost certainly will continue to target
democratic processes with the aims of affecting US voter preferences, exacerbating social tensions,
and undermining confidence in our democratic institutions and the integrity of the electoral process.

### BORDER AND IMMIGRATION SECURITY: Migrant encounters at our border have declined over
the last year, but migrants are still arriving in high numbers, complicating border and immigration
security. As overall encounters have declined, so too have encounters with individuals in the Terrorist
Screening Data Set, also known as the “terrorism watchlist,” which includes individuals associated
with information indicating they may be directly engaged in or supporting terrorist activities as well
as known associates of watchlisted individuals, such as family members. For several years prior to
this year's decline, terrorism watchlist encounters had increased, a trend consistent with the overall
increase in migrant encounters at the southwest border.

### CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY: Domestic and foreign adversaries almost certainly will
continue to threaten the integrity of our critical infrastructure with disruptive and destructive cyber
and physical attacks, in part, because they perceive targeting these sectors will have cascading impacts
on US industries and our standard of living. The PRC, Russia, and Iran will remain the most pressing
foreign threats to our critical infrastructure. Most concerningly, we expect the PRC to continue its
efforts to pre-position on US networks for potential cyber attacks in the event of a conflict with the
United States. Nation-states, criminal hacktivists, and financially motivated criminals will likely
hone their techniques to disrupt US services or to conduct espionage focused on gaining access to
US networks, including critical infrastructure entities. We assess that domestic and foreign violent
extremists will continue to call for physical attacks on critical infrastructure in furtherance of their
ideological goals and, at times, in response to international conflicts and crises.

### ECONOMIC SECURITY: Multifaceted and diverse economic threats—primarily from the PRC—will
likely continue to harm US producers and consumers and degrade the competitiveness and future
health of US companies and industries. The PRC likely will remain our greatest economic security
threat because of its aggressive use of anticompetitive, coercive policies and theft of US intellectual
property, technology, and trade secrets. Lastly, we expect our supply chains will remain vulnerable to
foreign manipulation abroad, which could harm global productivity and consumer demand.

Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

# PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY

Overview: Within this section, we examine lethal threats to the Homeland from terrorism and
illegal drugs, and national security threats from nation-state efforts to malignly influence US
audiences and suppress critical voices.

Over the next year, domestic and foreign violent extremist actors, the harmful effects of illegal drugs,
and adversarial states seeking to exacerbate our divisions as well as silence criticism from diaspora
communities will pose a threat to public safety and security in the Homeland. Specifically, we expect
the terrorism threat environment in the United States over the next year will remain high due to a
confluence of factors. These factors include violent extremist responses to domestic sociopolitical
developments and the 2024 election cycle, the enduring intent of FTOs to conduct or inspire
attacks in the Homeland, and the galvanizing effect that successful terrorist attacks abroad and
the ongoing conflict in the Middle East have had on a range of violent actors.1,2 Despite the lethal
and destabilizing threat terrorism poses to our country, the production, trafficking, and sale of illegal
drugs by transnational and domestic criminal actors remain the most lethal and persistent threats
to US communities. Concurrently, adversarial states are intent on sowing distrust in our institutions,
as well as confusion and division in our communities, through their malign influence campaigns, with
some actors seeking to boost these efforts during the 2024 election cycle. These state actors also
violate our rule of law and undermine freedom of speech in their efforts to suppress dissidents living
in the United States. (For more information on threats to the 2024 US election cycle, see page 10.)

## Terrorism

Looking into 2025, the threat of violence from US-based violent extremists—including DVEs who
are motivated by various ideologies and FTO-inspired homegrown violent extremists (HVEs)—will
remain high.3,4 The threat will continue to be characterized primarily by lone offenders or small
cells motivated to violence by a combination of racial, religious, gender, or anti-government
grievances; conspiracy theories; and personalized factors.5,6 We particularly are concerned about
the likelihood of violence motivated by developing domestic and global events, including the 2024
election cycle and the ongoing Israel-HAMAS conflict. A number of violent extremists embrace
multiple, sometimes competing motivations, challenging our ability to identify their potential
targets in advance because their pre-attack statements online are often unrelated or only loosely
related to the targets they ultimately choose.

*   Between September 2023 and July 2024, DVEs driven by various anti-government, racial,

or gender-related motivations have conducted at least four attacks in the Homeland, one of
which resulted in a death.7 US law enforcement disrupted at least seven additional DVE plots.
Two HVE attacks, partially motivated by the Israel-HAMAS conflict, also occurred during this
timeframe, and law enforcement disrupted at least three other HVE plots.

*   Over the last year, DVE efforts have focused on a range of targets, including ethnic and religious
minorities, government officials, and ideological opponents, while HVEs have mostly targeted
faith-based organizations. Some of these incidents focused on less secure targets, like houses
of worship, a store, and a university. DVEs motivated by various ideologies have also used
online messaging to increasingly promote the swatting and doxxing of ideological opponents,
including public and private officials at their residences.8  Other DVE-related violent threats have
targeted court officers associated with divisive sociopolitical cases; migrants and government
officials linked to immigration grievances; and Jewish, Muslim, and Arab communities, partly in
response to the Israel-HAMAS conflict.

*   DVEs and HVEs will continue to be influenced by sociopolitical drivers emphasized in popular
discourse, particularly those related to current events, which are used to amplify existing
narratives and justify violence. HAMAS’s terrorist attack against Israel on 7 October 2023
and the subsequent conflict between Israel and HAMAS and its regional allies have spurred
violent extremists across the ideological spectrum to promote attacks against Jewish, Muslim,
Christian, and Arab communities in the United States. These events will likely be referenced in
FTOs’ official and unofficial messaging and contribute to the radicalization and mobilization of
US-based individuals to violence into at least 2025.9

### Targeted Violence

In contrast to DVE and HVE attacks, most mass casualty attacks in the Homeland
over the last year were not motivated by an ideology, but were rather associated with
suspected or confirmed mental illness or driven by relationship grievances; however,
these factors alone are not diagnostic indicators of likely violence.10 Over the last
year, at least eight mass casualty attacks primarily motivated by reasons other than
an ideology have occurred in the United States, killing at least 38 and injuring 68.
Individuals acting alone conducted most of these attacks while using firearms and
targeting commercial and education facilities. At least one of these attackers cited the
1999 Columbine School shooting as inspiration, suggesting that tragic incident will
continue inspiring threat actors in the years to come.

FTOs, like ISIS and al-Qa‘ida, maintain the enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the
Homeland and have leveraged the conflict in the Middle East to reaffirm this intent. These
organizations maintain worldwide networks of supporters that could target the Homeland. FTO
media outlets promote violent rhetoric intended to inspire US persons to mobilize to violence, while
foreign terrorists continue engaging online supporters to solicit funds; create and share media; and
encourage followers to attack the Homeland, US interests, and what they perceive as the West.
Additionally, individuals with terrorism connections are interested in using established travel routes
and perceived permissive environments to facilitate their access to the United States. (For more
information on terrorist watchlist encounters at the US border, see page 15.) Among state
actors, we expect Iran to remain the primary sponsor of terrorism and continue its efforts to advance
plots against individuals—including current and former US officials—in the United States.

*   Following ISIS’s loss of territorial control in the Middle East in 2019 and three of its most senior
leaders in 2022, ISIS’s branches have taken a greater role in conducting operations on behalf
of the group. ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K)—ISIS’s regional branch in Afghanistan and Pakistan—has
been increasingly active outside of Afghanistan this year and will likely try to capitalize on its
notable 2024 attacks in Iran and Russia to recruit followers in the Homeland and the West,
as well as inspire individuals to mobilize to violence. These attacks, which killed more than 95
and 140 people, respectively, were the first major attacks conducted outside of the group's
traditional operating area in several years, and were the most recent examples of ISIS-K’s
successful recruitment of Central Asian supporters for attacks abroad. ISIS-K’s online media,
particularly its multilingual Voice of Khurasan magazine, continues to emphasize the group’s
intent to reach global audiences and galvanize supporters among Central Asian communities,
including diaspora populations in other countries. ISIS online media groups have also used
the Israel-HAMAS conflict to encourage attacks against the West and Jewish and Christian
communities, and ISIS media outlets have capitalized on recent attacks in Europe to inspire
more violent  action.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security

*   Al-Qa‘ida remains committed to striking the Homeland and has reinvigorated its outreach
to Western audiences. In December 2023, al-Qa‘ida’s affiliate in Yemen released its first
Inspire-branded video and the first Inspire publication since 2021, which encouraged
attacks against civil aviation and prominent individuals, urged retaliation against the West
for supporting Israel, and provided bomb-making instructions. Al-Qa‘ida has also been
inspired by the HAMAS attack against Israel and directed its supporters to conduct attacks
against the Homeland, Jewish targets, and Israel.

*   Iran maintains its intent to kill US government officials it deems responsible for the 2020 death

of its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)-Qods Force Commander and designated foreign
terrorist Qassem Soleimani. In August 2024, a Pakistani national with ties to Iran was indicted
for a planned assassination of US government officials. In June 2023, the US  Department of the
Treasury designated six  IRGC  members for their role in assassination plots targeting former US
government officials, dual US and Iranian nationals, and Iranian dissidents.

### Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
Threats To Endure

We expect predominantly aspirational and rudimentary interest in CBRN attacks will
continue in 2025. Among foreign and domestic threat actors, we assess that DVEs and
criminals will remain the most likely perpetrators of deliberate CBRN-related attacks.
Over the last year, there were 18 known deliberate chemical- or biological-related
incidents in the Homeland, four of which were linked to political or ideological motives
while the rest were criminal in nature. All of the incidents employed simple methods,
and one incident caused at least one death. Two of the 18 incidents involved the alleged
use of ricin, while 14 of the incidents employed easily obtainable chemicals—including
a range of pesticides, chlorine, bear spray, and other chemical irritants. Fentanyl was
weaponized in two instances. Foreign and domestic threat actors maintain aspirational
interest in radiological and nuclear attacks, but these attacks remain unlikely.

We expect threat actors will continue to explore emerging and advanced technologies
to aid their efforts in developing and carrying out chemical and biological attacks.
Over the last year, foreign and domestic extremists online expressed interest in using
DNA modification to develop biological weapons to target specific groups. We remain
concerned about the potential exploitation of advances in artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning to proliferate knowledge that supports the development of novel
chemical or biological agents.  (For more information on AI and threat actors, see pages
26–27.) Such advances could be exploited by state and state-sponsored adversaries,
but the necessary expertise for such exploitation most likely exceeds that of most
nonstate actors. We also remain concerned about the potential for threat actors to use
unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in chemical or biological attacks due to the continued
advancement of UAS technology and the growing availability of UAS.

## Illegal Drugs

We expect illegal drugs smuggled into and sold in the United States will continue to kill more
Americans than any other harmful security threat. Drug consumption kills tens of thousands of
Americans each year, although drug overdoses tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention declined in 2023 for the first time since 2018. While fentanyl seizure volumes are
significantly below those of methamphetamine and cocaine, fentanyl remains a top concern due
to its potency, lethality, and availability.11 Fentanyl seizures have declined this year from record
high seizures in FY 2023, but still remain elevated. DHS still seized enough fentanyl to kill the
entire American population many times over. Criminal actors and criminal drug manufacturers
are responding to increased US and partner nation efforts targeting the precursor chemicals needed
for fentanyl production by modifying existing chemicals and substituting different chemicals in
their drug compositions. Criminals also are adapting their smuggling methods to circumvent US
customs regulations aimed at blocking the import of these chemicals and drug manufacturing
equipment into the United States. US  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in FY 2024
year-to-date has also seized more methamphetamine at the US-Mexico border than in all of FY
2023, and we noted small increases in overdoses related to both cocaine and m  ethamphetamine.

*   We expect US-bound fentanyl smuggling and seizures to remain high into 2025 as

Mexico-based TCOs seek to meet user demand and the drug remains profitable. So far
into FY 2024, CBP and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) seizures of fentanyl and pill presses—which traffickers use to make toxic
drug mixtures that often include fentanyl—have declined compared to 2023, but still remain
elevated. In the first 10 months of FY 2024, DHS seized over 27,000 pounds of fentanyl,
compared to the over 43,000 pounds seized in 2023, a decline of nearly 40 p  ercent. In this
same timeframe, DHS seized 2,200 pill presses bound for the United States, down from
the 3,600 pill presses seized in 2023. We note that seizure totals alone are not necessarily
reflective of drug flow volumes.

*   The Sinaloa Cartel and New Generation Jalisco Cartel, two large Mexico-based TCOs, remain the
primary smugglers of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin into the United States.12
These TCOs and others almost certainly will continue to rely on their vast illicit networks to obtain
chemicals and finished drugs for the illicit US drug market. (For more information on TCO
exploitation of the US border, see page 16.) Primarily US-based traffickers are also increasingly
augmenting their fentanyl-related products with additives, such as xylazine, and fentanyl
alternatives, such as nitazenes—both of which are sourced from China-based firms. Nitazene can
be 10 times more potent than fentanyl alone. These addictive, inexpensive fentanyl combinations
and alternatives increasingly contribute to overdoses in the Homeland.

Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

*   China-based companies that supply chemical precursors and pill pressing equipment, and the
drug traffickers that seek to acquire these drug supplies, continue to adapt and use alternative
routes and chemical compounds to mitigate increased US and third-country law enforcement
efforts targeting the sale and import of these items. For example, this year, China shut down
25 c  ompanies selling fentanyl precursors and sent a warning to its pharmaceutical industry,
which prompted suppliers to change tactics, such as modifying customs labeling on packages
to avoid scrutiny. In 2024, traffickers increasingly used South Korea as an alternative transit
point en route to Mexico or the United States in an attempt to obscure the origins of pill
pressing equipment and evade law enforcement interdictions.

*   In FY 2024, CBP seizures of methamphetamine have surpassed amounts seized in FY 2023,

and we expect this will continue into the next year. Meanwhile, cocaine seizures remain
high relative to other drugs but below totals for FY 2023. Drug traffickers will continue to
produce and smuggle these drugs to meet sustained US consumer demand as long as they
remain lucrative for TCOs. In contrast to overall overdose numbers, overdoses linked to
methamphetamine and cocaine increased about 4 percent in 2023, in part due to consumer
co-use of these drugs with fentanyl. In 2025, we expect that drug traffickers will continue to
adulterate cocaine and methamphetamine to make them more potent and addictive.

### CBP Border Seizures of Fentanyl, Methamphetamine, Cocaine, and Heroin FY 2020–2024

![Image description: A bar chart showing CBP border seizures of Fentanyl, Methamphetamine, Cocaine, and Heroin from FY 2020 to FY 2024. The chart displays the weight of seizures in pounds for each drug type across the years. Fentanyl seizures show a significant increase from FY 2020 to FY 2023, with a slight decrease in FY 2024. Methamphetamine seizures show a steady increase, surpassing FY 2023 levels in FY 2024. Cocaine seizures are high but below FY 2023 levels. Heroin seizures are consistently lower than the other drugs.](Image description: A bar chart showing CBP border seizures of Fentanyl, Methamphetamine, Cocaine, and Heroin from FY 2020 to FY 2024.

## Nation‑States: Infuence Operations and Transnational
Repression

We expect state actors will continue to pose a host of threats to the Homeland and public safety.
Specifically, China, Iran, and Russia will use a blend of subversive, undeclared, criminal, and
coercive tactics to seek new opportunities to undermine confidence in US democratic institutions
and domestic social cohesion. Advances in AI likely will enable foreign adversaries to increase
the output, timeliness, and perceived authenticity of their mis-, dis-, and malinformation designed
to influence US audiences while concealing or distorting the origin of the content.13  (For more
information on the use of AI by threat actors, see pages 26–27; for more on influence operations
against the 2024 US election cycle, see pages 10–11.)14

*   Russia likely will continue to use traditional state-sponsored media, inauthentic websites,

social media networks, online bots, trolls, and individuals to amplify pro-Kremlin narratives and
conduct information operations targeting the United States. For example, over the past year,
Russian influence actors have amplified stories regarding US migration flows to stoke discord in
the United States. One Russian malign influence campaign used generative AI to create current
event news articles on inauthentic websites designed to appear as recognizable Western and
US-based media outlets.15

*   Since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s information operations have focused on justifying
its actions and seeking to reduce US domestic and Western support for Kyiv. In support of
these efforts, Moscow is also leveraging “influence-for-hire” firms—allegedly independent,
nongovernment-linked entities—likely to reach larger US audiences and bolster operational
security by concealing Moscow's ties with these firms’ promotion of pro-Kremlin narratives.
*   Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in its foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord
and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions. Over the last year, Iranian information
operations have focused on weakening US public support for Israel and Israel’s response to
the 7 October 2023 HAMAS terrorist attack. These efforts have included leveraging ongoing
protests regarding the conflict, posing as activists online, and encouraging protests. Prior to
the 2020 US presidential election, Iran also attempted to amplify divisive narratives to incite
violence, influence the US electorate, and degrade trust in the electoral process.

*   The PRC largely focuses its influence operations on discrediting the US government and

enhancing Beijing’s global standing. To this end, it is improving its ability to develop, tailor, and
disseminate disinformation using increasingly sophisticated tactics and technologies, including
AI. For example, AI has enabled Beijing to improve the authenticity of social media accounts
used in disinformation campaigns. The PRC is also conducting information operations targeting
US disaster response operations, which could impact recovery activities and place emergency
management personnel, facilities, and survivors at risk. PRC disinformation campaigns that
seek to exploit US disasters, as when it blamed the Hawaii wildfires on US military activity, may
also reduce trust in US institutions and officials and dissuade survivors from pursuing federal
recovery response and support. (For more information on the PRC’s disinformation efforts,  see
pages 11 and  26.)

Homeland Threat Assessment 2025

Nation-states also continue to engage in transnational repression activity targeting ethnic and
religious minorities, political dissidents, and journalists in the United States.16 We expect China
and Iran to remain the foremost transnational repression threats in the United States.

*   The PRC continues its efforts to control and silence dissent and criticism abroad of the

Chinese Communist Party and its General Secretary, Xi Jinping. In March 2024, the Department of
Justice (DOJ) indicted seven China-based Chinese nationals for their involvement in a PRC-backed
criminal hacking group targeting US-based critics, businesses, and political officials with malicious
cyber operations intended to intimidate and silence dissidents and steal from their businesses.
This group has been active for approximately 14 years, demonstrating the PRC’s commitment to
monitoring and targeting US and foreign critics and bolstering our confidence that the PRC will
continue to pursue perceived enemies in the Homeland.

*   Iran almost certainly will continue to target US-based Iranian dissidents because Iran views
their anti-regime activities as an existential threat. In the past several years, Iran has used
US persons, Iranian diaspora members, and third-country nationals to surveil, harass,
and intimidate regime dissidents. Iran’s use of violence—to include murder—against US-based
regime opponents since the early days of the Iranian Revolution, and the regime’s global
persecution of opponents, strengthens our assessment that it will continue to pursue
dissidents in the Homeland.

## Threat Actors Likely To Focus on 2024 Election Cycle

Our electoral processes are an attractive target for threat actors, and we expect many
will seek to influence the 2024 election cycle, while some others may seek to access or
interfere with election systems. While law enforcement is still investigating the motives
behind the apparent assassination attempts on a former US President, these incidents
highlight the magnitude of the threat surrounding the election cycle. Some  DVEs,
particularly those motivated by anti-government or partisan issues,  will  likely  view  a  wide
range of targets indirectly and directly associated with elections as viable targets for
violence with the intent of instilling fear among voters, candidates, and election workers,
as well as disrupting election processes leading up to and after the November election.
Foreign malign influence actors almost certainly will target democratic processes
across federal, state, and local governments, aiming to affect US voter preferences,
exacerbate social tensions, and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions
and processes, including election operations. Separately, foreign state-affiliated cyber
actors and cyber criminals almost certainly view network infrastructure that supports
US  elections as attractive targets. There is no reporting, however, to suggest that foreign
adversary targeting of such systems has ever prevented an eligible voter from casting a
ballot, compromised the integrity of any ballots cast, or disrupted the ability to tabulate
votes or transmit election results in a timely manner.

*   We expect DVEs will pose the most significant physical threat to government officials,
voters, and elections-related personnel and infrastructure, including polling places,
ballot drop box locations, voter registration sites, campaign events, political party
offices, and vote counting sites. In particular, anti-government or anti-authority DVEs,
many of whom likely will be inspired by partisan policy grievances or conspiracy
theories, will pose the most significant threat. We have also recently observed
a rise in disruptive tactics targeting election officials and offices—like those
observed in past election cycles—including hoax bomb threats, swatting, doxxing,
and mailing white powder letters, intended to instill fear and disrupt campaign
and election operations. We remain concerned that the use of these tactics will
increase particularly as we approach Election Day, with the intent of disrupting voting
and ballot counting processes. Some DVEs could also react violently should their
preferred candidate lose, or they could seek to exploit possible civil unrest if there
are perceptions of election fraud.

*   Online users in forums frequented by some DVEs have increasingly called for violence

linked to the 2024 election cycle and seek to promote violence in response to
politically and socially divisive topics, like immigration, abortion rights, and LGBTQIA+
issues or significant current events. We expect DVEs will continue to rely on these
issues to justify violence and promote their causes into the coming year.

accounts, and agents of influence to launder and spread their preferred narratives
and further their election-related goals. We are beginning to see Russia target
specific voter demographics, promote divisive narratives, and denigrate specific
politicians
