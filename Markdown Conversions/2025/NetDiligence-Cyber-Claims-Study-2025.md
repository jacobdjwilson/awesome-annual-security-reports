## Introduction

Welcome to the fifteenth annual NetDiligence® Cyber Claims Study. This report is based on the summary statistical analysis of over 10,000 cyber claims for incidents that occurred during the five-year period 2020–2024. By comparison, the first Cyber Claims Study, published in 2010, analyzed fewer than 100 cyber insurance claims.

### By the Numbers

*   10,402 claims analyzed, arising from incidents occurring 2020–2024
*   4,108 new and updated claims collected in 2025, from incidents occurring 2022–2024
*   1,691 claims analyzed arising from incidents occurring in 2024
*   98% of claims ($2.4B in total) from small to medium enterprises (SMEs) with less than $2 billion in annual revenue
*   2% of claims ($2.4B in total) from large companies with more than $2 billion in annual revenue
*   2,675 claims due to ransomware, 41% of which occurred between 2022 and 2024
*   1,864 claims due to business email compromise, 58% of which occurred between 2022 and 2024

### With Appreciation

We want to sincerely thank the cyber insurers listed on page 50 for their support of this report and their dedication to industry education. Many of them have contributed to this research every year for the past 15 years. Without their support, this educational report would not be possible.

### Suggestions

If you have ideas or requests for next year’s study, please let us know. Send us your thoughts at cyberclaims@netdiligence.com.

## Key Findings

*   We see enormous variances in the magnitude of loss data. The smallest claims were less than $1,000; the largest were over $500M. The numbers of records exposed ranged from 1 to over 140M.
*   There were dramatic differences between the numbers for SMEs and for large companies—multiples of 10x, 1000x, or more. The biggest large company in the dataset (over $290B in annual revenue) was approximately 29 million times larger than the smallest organization (less than $10K in annual revenue). The average large company ($12.5B in annual revenue) was more than 116 times larger than the average SME ($108M).
*   Even though large companies represented only 2% of claims (N=239), these claims accounted for 51% of the total incident cost analyzed in the report ($2.4B/$4.8B).
*   The dataset contains 8 claims >$100M, 55 claims $10M–$99M, and 432 claims $1M–$10M. Of the 8 claims >$100M, two occurred at organizations with <$700M in annual revenue.
*   In SMEs, there were 395 claims ≥$1M (4%). In large companies, there were 100 claims ≥$1M (43%)
*   Ransomware and business email compromise were the two leading causes of loss. At SMEs, they accounted for 50% of claims ≥$1K in the five-year period 2020–2024, and nearly 55% in 2024.
*   Ransoms rose to new and unprecedented levels, with initial demands as high as $150M and ransoms paid as high as $75M. There were 50 ransoms paid ≥$10M.

In short, incidents were more costly than ever.

## An Overview of the Data

The claims analyzed in this study come from organizations of all sizes, the smallest with less than $10K in annual revenue and the largest with over $290B. As the dataset is overwhelmingly weighted with claims from smaller companies, this may dilute the findings for large companies. Likewise, large companies can function as outliers, skewing the findings for small organizations. Therefore, the dataset has been divided into two categories based on the size of the insured entity. Organizations with less than $2B in annual revenue are defined as small to medium enterprises (SMEs), while those with $2B or greater in annual revenue are defined as large companies.

### Proportion of Claims by Company Size
2020-2024
(N=10,402)

![Figure 6: Proportion of Claims by Company Size](https://i.imgur.com/example.png)

66% of study participants provided estimates of the annual revenue of the insured entities. Analysis of this data provides the following company demographics:

*   SMEs: annual revenue ranged from less than $10K to $1.9B. The average was $108M. SMEs accounted for 98% of claims but only 49% of total incident cost.
*   Large companies: annual revenue ranged from $2B to more than $290B. The average was $12.5B. Large companies accounted for only 2% of claims but 51% of total incident cost.

As artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes the ways in which we work and communicate, its integration into business operations has created new risks that are reshaping the cyber insurance landscape. Coupled with the persistent threat of third-party vulnerabilities, cyber insurers are facing unprecedented challenges in accurately assessing emerging risks. These challenges place cyber insurers in a unique position to effect critical change within information security frameworks by requiring more from insureds. By embracing a more agile approach to underwriting and requiring more programmatic “skin in the game” from insureds, cyber insurers can preserve or increase market share, protect or reduce loss ratios, and contribute to a more secure digital environment.

## Claims by Year of Event

The study includes 10,402 incidents occurring 2020-2024. The incident distribution by year is depicted in Figure 8.

The claims analyzed in this report come from incidents at organizations in 7 revenue groupings and 18 business sectors, across 25 causes of loss and 13 types of data.

Demographic analyses are based on all 10,402 claims while cost analyses are based upon the 9,171 claims that reported incident cost ≥$1,000.

### Percentage of Claims by Year
(N=10,402)

![Figure 8: Percentage of Claims by Year](https://i.imgur.com/example.png)

## Incident Cost and Payout

Study participants were asked to provide information about the amount of money paid on a claim and to give an estimate of the total cost of the incident, including self-insured retention (SIR) and other costs that may have been excluded due to the terms of the policy.

The largest incident at a large company occurred in 2021 (>$500M). Between 2020 and 2024, there were 11 claims at large companies with over $50M in total incident cost, and another 29 claims with $10M-$50M in total incident cost.

There were 395 SME claims over $1M, and another 341 claims $500K–$1M. The largest SME claims occurred in 2022 (>$100M). These incidents happened in the manufacturing and healthcare sectors. Both involved ransomware with very large ransoms and extremely large business interruption losses (>$90M). Neither company was extremely large—annual revenue for each was <$700M.

Payouts for all organization sizes covered 32% of the total incident cost. For SMEs, the five-year payout was 69% of the total incident cost. At large companies, this number was 27%.

For SMEs, these proportions have dropped from last year’s report (69% vs 81%). For large companies, they remain steady (27% vs 24%).

Figures 9 and 10 provide year-by-year averages of payout versus total cost, plus the five-year averages of payout amount and total incident cost for both SMEs and large companies.

The five-year numbers for SMEs are significantly higher than reported last year. Average total incident cost rose from $205 to $264K while average payouts increased from $167 to $183K.

At large companies, the changes were less dramatic. Average total incident cost and payouts for 2020-2024 were $10.3M and $2.7M, compared to $12.7M and $3.1M for the period 2019-2023.

## Incident and Crisis Services Costs

For all organizations, crisis services costs ranged from less than $100 to almost $26M. Incident costs for these claims, inclusive of SIR, ranged from less than $1,000 to over $160M. The averages were influenced by some very expensive claims. Not every claim involves a crisis services element, causing the number of claims or the “N” values on the graphs to vary.

### SMEs

At SMEs, average crisis services costs ranged from $121K in 2020 to $144K in 2024, as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 12 depicts the percent of total cost expended on crisis services —47% for the five-year interval 2020–2024. Notably, this represents a dramatic increase since our last report, 40% higher than the 2019-2023 average.

Figures 13 and 14 depict average crisis services costs by individual component, as well as the percentage of total crisis services cost that each component represents. During the five-year period, forensics accounted for 21% of the total, and legal guidance accounted for another 9% of the total. These proportions are similar to those reported last year.

### Large Companies:

Figure 15 illustrates considerable variability in both the average crisis services cost and the incident cost at large companies. Here, average incident cost ranged from $4.7M to $22.5M. Outlier events in 2021 and 2023 contributed to spikes in averages for those years.

Figure 16 shows crisis service cost as a percent of total cost. Over the five-year period, this percentage ranged from 20% to 75%, with an average of 25%. The previous five-year period showed a similar average (28% from 2019-2023).

Figure 17 breaks down crisis services costs into a variety of service components and shows much variability.

> Experian saw a shift in breach dynamics last year: fewer events overall, but enterprise organization breaches were 22% larger and impacted more individuals. This contributed to higher overall crisis services costs, as organizations needed to notify more individuals and scale response efforts accordingly. Services like notifications, call center support, and identity protection continue to represent a significant portion of total incident costs and play a key role in managing stakeholder expectations.

## Business Interruption (BI)

### SMEs

BI costs were reported for 316 incidents. Since 2020, the average BI cost and corresponding average incident cost have remained high. The increase in 2022 was caused by two very large outlier incidents, each in excess of $100M.

Additional analysis shows that the five-year average incident cost of a claim with BI was over 650% greater than a claim without BI. In 2024, the average claim involving BI was 250% greater than one that did not.

Further, ransomware incidents at SMEs accounted for 81% of claims with a BI component. The five-year average BI cost for ransomware incidents was $1.4M with a total incident cost of $2.1M. In 2024, these numbers were $751K and $1.1M, respectively.

## Recovery Expense

### SMEs

274 claims reported recovery expense. As Figure 20 shows, both recovery expense and total incident cost have been steadily increasing since 2020. The average five-year incident cost of these claims is over 300% higher than incidents without recovery expense.

Ransomware incidents accounted for 78% of the claims with reported recovery expense. The five-year average incident cost of these events was $961K, 400% higher than incidents without recovery expense. In 2024, these incidents cost almost 130% more.

### Large Companies

Eleven large company claims reported recovery expense spanning 2020-2024. Recovery expense for these incidents ranged from $20K to $4.5M (average=$822K). The corresponding incident cost ranged from $25K to $28.0M (average $10.2M). Nine of these claims were due to ransomware, with ransoms averaging $7.2M paid in six incidences. The corresponding average incident cost for these six claims was $11.7M.

So far, we have collected no claims with recovery expense in 2024. That may change next year as we collect additional data for 2024.

#### Average Recovery Expense
SMEs

![Figure 20: Average Recovery Expense SMEs](https://i.imgur.com/example.png)

## Legal Costs

### SMEs

There were 203 claims in the dataset that reported legal or litigation expense from one or more of these categories: legal settlement, legal defense, regulatory fines, and regulatory action. Figure 21 depicts the year-by averages for these four categories as well as their five-year averages. There was much year-by-year variability in these costs.

#### Average Legal Costs
SMEs
(N=203)

![Figure 21: Average Legal Costs SMEs](https://i.imgur.com/example.png)

### Large Companies

The dataset contained only 15 claims reporting at least one type of legal or litigation expense. For the five-year period, the overall average was $20.1M, with a maximum of over $500M (settlement). This large settlement drives up the overall averages. Average settlement defense cost was $155K. There were no regulatory fines in the five-year data.

> This study appears to indicate that the increasing number of lawsuits arising from data privacy/security events have driven down the average cost. As the leader of our firm’s cybersecurity litigation practice—currently defending over 150 data privacy/security-related class actions—I know that smaller populations notified of data breaches are triggering more class actions, especially in the healthcare and financial services industries.
>
> Allen E. Sattler, Partner & Vice-Chair Constangy Cyber Team

## Records Exposed

When looking at the five-year window, we see both the number of claims reporting records exposed and the overall number of records continuing to decrease. The 2020–2024 range contains 396 claims that reported more than one¹ record exposed, whereas the 2019–2023 range contained 436 of these claims. These incidents exposed over 715M records —260M at SMEs and 455M at large companies —down 20% from last year’s report.

We cannot pinpoint why the number of claims with exposed records is decreasing, nor can we say whether this represents a change in exposure or a change in reporting. However, we can speculate:

*   The large proportion of ransomware and BEC claims since 2020 do not involve exposed records.
*   Perhaps (as we have speculated in the past) the lack of utility of per record metrics is causing insurers to be less concerned with the number of records than they once were.

Figures 22 and 23 illustrate the number of exposed records year-by-year and with a five-year average. There is no clear pattern. As found in previous NetDiligence Cyber Claims reports, the number of records exposed does not correlate well with either the size of an organization or the total incident cost.

(N=40)

![Figure 23: Average Number of Records Exposed Large Companies](https://i.imgur.com/example.png)

## Recordless Claims and Claims with Exposed Records

“Recordless” claims are incidents that do not expose records. Ransomware, business email compromise (BEC), wire transfer fraud, DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), and theft of money accounted for most of these incidents.

As Figure 24 shows, the average incident cost for each category is about the same over five years.

Please note that in a certain number of incidents, study participants indicated that records were exposed but did not provide a number. We included these incidents in the records exposed analysis here but excluded them from the number of records analysis above.

## Criminal and Non-Criminal Activities

Criminal activities include:

*   Hacking
*   Ransomware
*   Social Engineering
*   Business Email Compromise (BEC)
*   Phishing

Non-criminal events include:

*   Staff Mistakes
*   Mishandling of Paper Records
*   Improper Disclosure
*   Lost Laptops
*   Programming Errors
*   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
*   System Glitches
*   Stolen Devices
*   Theft of Money
*   Banking/ACH Fraud
*   Legal Actions

### Criminal vs Non-Criminal—Percentage of Claims
SMEs
(N=8,200)

![Figure 25: Criminal vs Non-Criminal—Percentage of Claims SMEs](https://i.imgur.com/example.png)

There are fewer and fewer non-criminal incidents, which may be attributed to better employee training and more sophisticated controls. At SMEs, the proportion of claims caused by criminal activities ranged from a low of 97% in 2020 to a high of 100% in 2023. This proportion has been over 97% since 2020.

Over five years, criminal incidents at SMEs were, on average, much more costly than non-criminal incidents. Several large events in 2022 involving wrongful data collection, trademark infringement, and privacy breaches (incident cost between $1M and $5M) caused the non-criminal average cost in that year to exceed the criminal average cost by a large margin. (Figure 26, below)

> The sophistication of hacking groups varies, so ransom demands don’t always match a company’s revenue. Instead, attackers often consider a combination of factors: the company’s revenue, access to sensitive data that could be further exploited, and the urgency to restore critical services. This combination creates a strong incentive for attackers to strike.

Comparisons of criminal to non-criminal incidents at large companies are outlined in Figures 27 and 28 below. Here we see that 90% of incidents reported at large companies involved criminal activity. The cost of criminal incidents was dramatically higher than the cost of non-criminal ones.

## Self-Insured Retentions (SIR)

The dataset contained 5,576 claims for SMEs that provided an amount for SIR. These amounts ranged $0–$10M. Year-by-year averages are shown below.

The dataset contained 139 claims for large companies that reported an amount for SIR. These amounts ranged $0–$10M. The year-by-year averages are shown below. Since 2020, the average SIR has been rising steadily for large companies—the average SIR in 2024 was over three times the amount in 2020.

## Causes of Loss

The top four causes of loss at SMEs were

*   Ransomware
*   Business Email Compromise (BEC)
*   Hackers
*   Wire Transfer Fraud

Losses in these four categories accounted for 72% of claims and 85% of total incident cost ($2.0B). For metrics on all sectors, please see the graphs and tables in the appendices.

### Ransomware

The number of ransomware incidents reported to NetDiligence decreased from 757 in 2020 to 397 in 2024. Since anecdotal evidence does not support the narrative of decline in ransomware, we posit that apparent decreases may be due to delays in reporting. Each Cyber Claims Study collects data for three previous years. As more data for 2023 and 2024 is added to the composite picture, totals will likely climb.²

Ransom amounts and total incident cost have increased dramatically over the past five years.

At SMEs, outlier events drove up the average incident cost in 2022. At large companies, outlier events heavily impacted the averages in 2021 and 2023.

> Once again, ransomware is the primary driver of losses in this year’s report—it’s the most impactful type of attack, potentially creating significant financial, operational and reputational harm. Recently, we’ve seen multiple third-party and supply chain breaches across industries. As demonstrated in the survey, these breaches have enabled threat actors to be able to ratchet up ransom demands and, in some cases, secure payments. This is because the service provider needs to restore lots of clients, since the attack doesn’t just affect them as a company. With businesses deeply integrated with third parties, software providers and SaaS platforms, recovery can take weeks, causing considerable business and productivity losses. These challenges emphasize the importance of implementing effective controls and recovery strategies.

### Business Email Compromise (BEC)

BEC was the second leading cause of loss at SMEs. The number of BEC claims per year had been consistent from 2020-2023, ranging from 300 to 400 per year. We have seen a notable increase in the number of BEC claims in 2024 (N=468), although the average incident cost is low ($75K).

> We saw a notable increase of BEC cases in 2024. Despite worries of sophisticated compromises, 84% of those cases involved someone clicking an email link. Email security that prevents accidental clicking on a malicious attachment from turning into a compromised network is more critical than ever, and strong payment controls to validate transaction identities can prevent fraudulent funds transfers altogether.

### Hackers

Hackers were the third leading cause of loss at SMEs. Figure 35 below tells the good news: after large increases in 2022 and 2023, the average cost of a hacking incident has dropped in 2024.

> The Cyber Claims Study showed an increase in wire transfer fraud losses in 2024. This finding mirrored what Surefire Cyber experienced firsthand. Not only did the average dollar amounts rise, but we also responded to a case where $15 million was stolen. Threat actors continue to target organizations of all sizes, exploiting urgency and trust. We urge clients to develop clear protocols for verifying financial transactions and changes to account information. They should remain alert to last-minute changes to email account addresses and require a second verification method and dual approval before altering employee payment details. These layered defenses help stop fraud before the funds leave the account. By implementing these safeguards into daily operations, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to these attacks.
