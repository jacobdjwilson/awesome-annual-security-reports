## Executive Overview

Welcome to the 2025 Identity Security Landscape! This study wouldn't be possible without the generous insights from our 2,600 security decision-makers across 20 countries around the globe—a big thank you to our contributors and researchers.

This report examines cyberattack trends impacting identity across modern IT ecosystems and shares insights on how security professionals can and should prepare.

Our report highlights how the race to adopt AI has inadvertently expanded the attack surface with a surge of machine identities.  Attackers use AI to create new threats; defenders use it to defend against them—and businesses incur new identity-centric risks as they embed agenetic AI across the enterprise.

Nine out of 10 organizations report a successful identity-centric breach. Over half (51%) fell victim to phishing and vishing attacks multiple times.  72% of employees regularly use AI tools on the job—yet 68% of respondents still lack identity security controls for these technologies. Machine identities now outnumber human identities by more than 80 to 1.

The geopolitical landscape is also concerning. State-sponsored attackers are increasingly using AI in disruptive operations. Nation-states are collaborating with cybercriminal organizations to ramp up cyber espionage and disinformation.

AI can both protect and attack.  It can detect vulnerabilities—and exploit them.  Organizations are creating a surge of unmanaged and unsecured machine identities. The privileged access of AI agents represents an entirely new threat vector.  We must own our identity risk strategy and modernize our approach.

This report covers:

1. AI’s potential to be an identity-centric threat trifecta.
2. The surge of machine identities and the unique challenges they present.
3. The emergence of identity silos and how they undermine business resiliency.


Sincerely,

Clarence Hinton

## The AI Trifecta: Attacker, Defender and Identity Risk

In 2025, AI is used across many sectors.  Our survey found that 94% of respondents use AI and LLM processes to enhance their overall identity security strategies.  61% are considering using AI to secure both human and machine identities in the next 12 months.  However, bad actors are using AI to make their attacks faster, smarter, and harder to stop.

AI and LLMs are expected to drive the creation of most new identities with privileged and sensitive access in 2025.  Organizations must secure the AI systems they deploy and the new identities those systems create. We must manage AI as a weapon, a defender, and a system we must secure.

**Clunky, error-filled spam—and other things we miss**

In the last 12 months, phishing has remained the leading cause of identity-related breaches. AI-driven phishing emails are highly personalized and nearly indistinguishable from legitimate senders. AI automates and coordinates outreach across multiple channels. Nine out of 10 organizations reported experiencing a successful breach of this nature. Over three-quarters of respondents reported falling prey to successful phishing attacks.

**Identity security’s new clutch player**

For security teams, AI can reduce response times. It can analyze historical attack patterns, predict what’s next, prioritize vulnerabilities, and automatically shut down threats.  AI handles time-consuming tasks, allowing security teams to focus on bigger threats. 55% of respondents say they use AI for advanced analytics and anomaly detection.

**Meet your new sidekick/supervillain**

Securing AI systems, including their machine identities, is critical. AI’s reliance on vast amounts of data increases the risk of breaches.  AI models can be manipulated into executing malicious commands. Attackers are finding new ways to “jailbreak” LLMs.

**Shadow AI: No one approved it. Everyone’s using it.**

Enterprises use multiple approaches when hosting AI tools. While 64% say that all their organization’s AI tools are approved and managed by IT, almost half (47%) say their organization is unable to secure and manage all the “shadow AI” tools in use.  36% of respondents report using AI tools that are not fully approved or managed by IT.  Shadow AI is harder to detect because AI capabilities are often embedded invisibly into approved software.

**Future shock: The emergence of AI agents**

AI agents introduce a new layer of complexity—dynamic, machine identities with human-like autonomy.  Securing thousands or millions of these entities requires ensuring proper authentication, regulating privileged access, and maintaining strict lifecycle control. The attack surface of an AI agent spans three layers: infrastructure, access, and model.  Traditional IAM systems aren’t equipped to handle this.

**CyberArk Insight**

We recommend a three-tiered approach: Secure Development, Secure Deployment, and Secure Use.  Machines that behave like humans require both human and machine security controls.


## Machine Identities: The Sprawl Awakens

Machine identities quietly keep digital infrastructures humming.  Every day, new cloud workloads, AI/ML services, and interconnected systems come online, requiring new machine identities. 94% of respondents report an increase in machine identities over the past three years.  Enterprises are operating amidst a staggering proliferation of machine identities: more than 80 machine identities for every human identity.

Over half of survey respondents (54%) predict AI and LLM tool adoption will continue to drive the creation of machine identities with privileged and sensitive access. 88% still define ‘privileged user’ as human-only. 42% of machine identities have access to sensitive data.

**Any (unsecured) port in a storm**

Cybercriminals can exploit machine identities with excessive privileges. They can register their own devices or apps, extract API keys, hijack abandoned service accounts, etc. Machine identities emerged as this year’s top perceived identity risk.

**Ignorance is risk: The human side of identity sprawl**

Human identities remain a challenge. Users need access to many applications and tools, and unmanaged endpoints represent significant security blind spots.

**CyberArk Insight**

Organizations should centralize solutions and adopt an identity security strategy that recognizes all identities pose security risks.  Some recommendations include: secure every identity, reassess the definition of privileged user, discover secrets in cloud service providers’ built-in secrets stores, automate the certificate lifecycle, reduce unmanaged endpoint risks, and leverage different approaches like just-in-time secrets rotation.


## Breaking Silos, Taking Names

For most enterprises, identity security was assembled piecemeal.  Silos are deadly for business resiliency. 70% of respondents identify silos as a root cause of organizational risk.

**Privileged access: More management, less mystery**

This fragmentation impacts tracking entitlements and permissions. While 94% of respondents use tools that automatically protect and monitor all cloud sessions, 68% say that the lack of integration of their identity and security tools hinders their efforts to detect attacks.  88% of respondents report that insurers are demanding stricter privilege controls.

**You can’t secure what you can’t see**

Almost half (49%) of survey respondents report that their organization lacks full visibility into entitlements and permissions across their entire cloud environment.  Controls drop further for DevOps environments, AI and LLMs, and service accounts.

**The top 6 strategic identity security investments for 2025**

87% of respondents say they experienced at least two successful identity-centric breaches in the past 12 months. 75% of security professionals agree that business efficiencies are prioritized over strong cybersecurity in their organization.  Respondents are prioritizing better application-based security controls, stronger privileged access management (PAM) controls, and identity governance and compliance (IGA).

**CyberArk Insight**

Addressing fragmented legacy solutions is key.  Adopt a “build to protect mindset”. Streamline and automate IAM and identity security processes. Consolidate and centralize identity security tools. Modernize with a faster, more adaptive IGA solution.


## Parting Thoughts

Today’s cybersecurity threats and AI buzz are pervasive. Ransomware is a funding mechanism for nation-states, and cybercrime is lucrative. Adversaries are embedding AI into their tactics, while organizations are embedding AI into their workflows, creating new security blind spots.  The volume of machine identities is forcing organizations to rethink how they manage and secure them.

The goal of every attacker is to compromise an identity. Organizations need to secure every identity, human and machine, and deliver a cohesive end-to-end experience.

To build business resilience, organizations need a practical, risk-based approach grounded in identity security.  We must authenticate and secure AI agents at scale, manage and limit access to sensitive data, control AI identity lifecycles, and consolidate security tools.
