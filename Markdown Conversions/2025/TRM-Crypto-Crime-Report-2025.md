2025 Crypto
Crime Report

Key trends that shaped the illicit
crypto market in 2024

TRMLABS.COM

## Introduction

In 2024, crypto transaction volume[^1] grew to over USD 10.6 trillion, up 56%
since 2023. Illicit volume currently appears to have dropped to USD 45 billion,
down 24% since 2023. This represents 0.4% of overall crypto volume and marks
a 51% decrease from 2023. TRM now determines that illicit volume accounted
for approximately 0.9% of total crypto volume in 2023.

The top categories of illicit activity on the blockchain currently remain largely
the same as in 2023: Sanctions (33% of illicit volume), Blocklisted[^2] (29% of illicit
volume), and Scams and Fraud (24% of illicit volume).

[^1]: Volume on Bitcoin, Ethereum, TRON, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon.

[^2]: Blocklisted addresses are addresses that appear on public blocklists of stablecoin issuers, trusted
law enforcement agencies’ advisories and alerts, and well-established VASPs’ or community-
driven organizations that serve the purpose of informing other entities on the risk associated with
published addresses. These addresses may contain funds associated with a range of illicit activities.
Some addresses such as stablecoin contracts are also blocklisted to prevent users from sending
funds to them or to prevent them from being called.

TRM expects overall illicit volume figures to be
revised upwards

These overall figures represent TRM’s current estimates of illicit volume based
on our latest available intelligence. However, due to the inherent complexities of
detecting and attributing illicit transactions — and delayed reporting — we expect
overall figures for illicit volume to increase over time as new data emerges.

At the time of publication of this annual report in early 2024, TRM’s estimates
for illicit volume were USD 34.8 billion for 2023. TRM now estimates the figure
to be USD 58.7 billion, reflecting an upward revision of 69%. It is important
to note that even the revised figure may not be final, as attribution is likely to
expand across the coming years. In line with attribution expanding over time,
the illicit volume for 2022 has been revised upwards from USD 49.6 billion
reported last year to USD 56.6 billion based on our current estimate — two years
after the end of 2022.

Given the high likelihood of future upward revisions to overall illicit volumes,
readers should consider the figures in this report as a dynamic baseline. The
final estimate for 2024 illicit volume will most likely be well above USD 44.7
billion reported here, and may even be above USD 75 billion if we carry forward
our upward revision for the 2023 figure so far. We anticipate that category-
specific trends and assessments of threat actor tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) will remain more consistent and provide reliable insights into
evolving risk patterns.

### Methodology

Our estimate of total illicit crypto volume is based on the USD value of funds
stolen in crypto hacks[^3], combined with the USD value of transfers to blockchain
addresses on Bitcoin, Ethereum, TRON, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon
that we have linked to entities in illicit categories such as investment schemes,
sanctions, and darknet marketplaces. We consider our estimate as the minimum,
or "floor," for the volume of illicit cryptocurrency, and expect figures to increase
over time with delayed attribution and reporting.

The following are excluded from our estimate of illicit cryptocurrency volume:

1.  Proceeds from crimes initially conducted in fiat currency and subsequently
converted into cryptocurrency: These proceeds are typically converted into
crypto through on-ramp services and are challenging to identify with on-
chain data alone. Accurately assessing the value of these proceeds would
require additional data from virtual asset service providers and national
financial intelligence units.

2.  Transfers to blockchain addresses that have not been linked to illicit

activities: We estimate the potential maximum volume of such transfers by
analyzing transactions with unattributed addresses that do not appear to
represent internal transfers within a single entity.

3.  Transfers related to the laundering of illicit crypto proceeds: Our figure of
illicit crypto USD volume estimates the crypto revenue generated by illicit
entities; it excludes the laundering of these proceeds. In calculating illicit
crypto volume as a percentage of total crypto volume, we only consider
incoming transaction volume linked to attributed entities, excluding transfers
that appear to be internal to entities such as peeling chains and certain
swaps on decentralized exchanges.

[^3]: USD value at time of hack.

## TRON saw the largest drop in illicit volume in 2024

In 2024, the largest percentage of illicit crypto activity occurred on the TRON
blockchain (58% of illicit volume), followed by Ethereum (24% of illicit volume),
Bitcoin (12% of illicit volume), Binance Smart Chain (3% of illicit volume), and
Polygon (3% of illicit volume), reflecting continued preference for blockchains
that have low transaction fees, smart contracts, and popular stablecoins.

However, of all the blockchains analyzed, TRON saw the most significant
decline in illicit volume, dropping by USD 6 billion and halving its proportion
of illicit volume. 49% of TRON's illicit volume was linked to sanctioned entities,
while 32% involved blocklisted funds — assets that have been effectively
neutralized and are no longer accessible to threat actors. Of the subset of
blocklisted funds in USDT on TRON, roughly 20% has been reissued to victims
and government accounts.

This reduction in illicit volume reflects, in part, TRON’s focus on rooting out illicit
actors on its blockchain. In August 2024, TRON, Tether, and TRM announced
the establishment of the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a first-of-its-kind
initiative aimed at facilitating public-private collaboration to combat illicit
activity associated with the use of USDT on the TRON blockchain.

In the months since launch, the initiative — in collaboration with law enforcement
— facilitated the freezing of over USD 130 million in illicit proceeds.

## Sanctioned entities continued to drive illicit crypto volume

Sanctioned entities drove the largest share of illicit crypto volume in 2024,
though inflows decreased from USD 21.9 billion in 2023 to USD 14.8 billion
— a 33% decline.

Garantex, Russia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Nobitex, Iran’s largest
cryptocurrency exchange, accounted for over 85% of the inflows to sanctioned
entities and jurisdictions, though their overall volumes also decreased. This
is likely due to a number of factors, including the potential use of alternative
services and the uncertainty of regime support for cryptocurrency use in heavily
sanctioned jurisdictions. The end of 2024 saw reports from Iran indicating that
the Iranian regime is preparing to regulate the crypto economy for increased
transparency, as well as reports that the Central Bank of Iran would be closing
access to the portals of cryptocurrency exchanges.

### Leveraging sanctions to disrupt the Russian illicit economy, Hamas, and Hezbollah

In 2024, the sanctions landscape centered on efforts by the United States and
its global partners to disrupt Russia’s illicit economy, targeting key entities
and individuals involved in sanctions evasion and money laundering through
virtual currencies. OFAC issued 13 sanctions designations that included 86
cryptocurrency addresses — many of which targeted Russia and cyber-related
individuals and entities, including members of the Trickbot ransomware
group, money laundering networks, and cryptocurrency exchanges facilitating
illicit activities.

![Chart: Distribution of 86 designated addresses by OFAC sanctions regime]

Centralized and peer-to-peer exchanges NetEx24, Bitpapa, and Cryptex were
among those targeted for facilitating millions worth of transactions for illicit and
sanctioned actors. Inflows to these three exchanges dropped an average of
82% in the three months post-designation, compared to their pre-designation
volumes. Individuals like Elena Chirkinyan and Khadzi-Murat Dalgatovich
Magomedov were also designated following a major global investigation led by
the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) “Operation Destabilise,” for
their role in money laundering and sanctions evasion operations through various
means, including cryptocurrency.

In addition to Russia and cyber-related designations, there were a number
of crypto-related designations of entities and individuals connected to
Hamas and Hezbollah in the wake of the October 7 attack in 2023. These
designations included GazaNow (a Gaza-based entity) and its founder Mustafa
Ayash for raising funds for Hamas following the October 7 attack, as well as
Tawfiq Muhammad Sa’id al-Law (a Lebanon-based Syrian hawala operator)
for providing Hezbollah with digital wallets to receive funds from IRGC-QF
commodity sales and conducting crypto transfers on behalf of sanctioned
Syrian entities.

## Cryptocurrency use in terrorist financing expanded

While it’s highly likely that cash, traditional financial institutions, money service
businesses, and hawalas still constitute the majority of terrorism financing,
evidence of the growing use of cryptocurrency by terrorist groups is clear.
Of particular concern is cryptocurrency’s growing role for ISIS’ affiliate in
Afghanistan, Islamic State Khurasan Province (ISKP), one of the most significant
transnational terrorist threats today.

### ISIS continued to grow its use of cryptocurrency

Over the past year, ISKP has been linked to numerous attacks, foiled plots, and
arrests in countries such as Russia, Turkey, Iran, Germany, France, Austria, Italy,
and the United States. In several cases, cryptocurrency played a central role.

-   In March 2024, ISKP carried out a deadly attack in Moscow that was partially
    financed with cryptocurrency.

-   In June 2024, a German individual, who sent USD 1,700 of cryptocurrency
    to ISKP, was arrested after applying to work as a security guard at a major
    European soccer tournament — the type of event ISKP has repeatedly urged
    its supporters to target.

-   In the same month, Turkish authorities announced that they had arrested ISIS
    financiers operating within the country and seized cryptocurrency wallets.

-   In December 2024, a UK-based individual was sentenced to prison for
    sending more than GBP 16,000 worth of cryptocurrency to ISKP.

![Image: ISKP soliciting cryptocurrency donations via its newsletter]

Over the past year, TRM has identified hundreds of transactions linked to ISKP,
ranging between USD 100 to USD 15,000. These transactions have flown through
regulated exchanges, high-risk exchanges, and individual cryptocurrency traders,
some of whom may knowingly facilitate ISKP’s activities.

TRM also identified on-chain links between ISKP-affiliated addresses and Syria-
based fundraising campaigns for ISIS members and families held in camps,
which remain a significant driver of cryptocurrency use by ISIS supporters
around the world. TRM works diligently to identify addresses that various terror
financing campaigns are using so that law enforcement can trace and disrupt
campaigns and actors.

### Hamas, GazaNow, and Mujahideen Brigades received thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency donations

In Gaza, where the conflict between Israel and Hamas entered its second year,
cryptocurrency donations continued to flow into addresses associated with
Hamas, GazaNow, and the Mujahideen Brigades.

While Hamas had announced in the spring of 2023 that they had stopped
accepting cryptocurrency donations — largely due to the success of Israel
and the United States in targeting their cryptocurrency infrastructure — TRM
data indicates that the group still received tens of thousands of dollars in
cryptocurrency donations, albeit more discretely.

Additionally, the Hamas-linked entity, GazaNow, still solicited cryptocurrency
donations, despite being targeted by Israel and sanctioned by OFAC and other
agencies around the world. GazaNow has raised tens of thousands of dollars
since the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.

Other fundraising campaigns that have raised tens of thousands of dollars
include one for the Mujahideen Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian
Mujahideen Movement, which was sanctioned by the United States in
November of 2018.

### Stablecoins remained the primary choice for terrorist financing organizations

Shifts related to terrorist financing organizations’ reliance on stablecoins,
identified by TRM beginning in 2022, persisted in 2024. TRM analysis indicates
that, despite growing interest in Monero, stablecoins remain the primary choice
for terrorist financing organizations.

While ISKP, for example, promotes Monero in the magazine produced by its
media unit, TRM assesses that ISKP predominantly utilizes stablecoins to move
and store funds. Furthermore, fundraising campaigns tracked by TRM still
overwhelmingly prefer stablecoins, although it remains to be seen whether the
rising prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will have a long-term impact
on their choices.

As it relates to Monero, in the fall of 2023, ISKP’s official media arm launched its
inaugural donation drive with Monero as the chosen currency. First announced in
the magazine “Voice of Khurasan,” produced by ISKP’s media unit, al-Azaim, calls
for donations using Monero have since become a regular occurrence. TRM has
identified fundraising campaigns linked to other ISIS affiliates, including in India
and the Philippines, that have also solicited donations in Monero. While these
developments are of concern, widespread adoption of Monero remains unlikely
in the short term given the technical challenges and restrictions associated with
its use, including the delisting of privacy coins by major exchanges.

### Threat actors displayed increased operational security

Terrorists and their supporters began to display growing sophistication in their
use of cryptocurrency, with the numerous arrests of individuals in 2024 being a
likely driver of improved TTPs. This included:

-   Growing use of unhosted wallets and mixers. Terrorists and their supporters
    have been sharing tips online regarding best practices and services or
    websites that provide the most protection.

-   Use of fake credentials to bypass Know Your Customer (KYC) controls
    imposed by exchanges.

-   Growing interest in privacy coins such as Monero.

As terrorists’ use of cryptocurrency grows in sophistication, ongoing
monitoring, threat intelligence, and advanced technical capabilities will be
required to identify their activity on the blockchain.

## Ransomware demands reached an all-time high

Ransomware has remained a prolific and growing threat in 2024, with 5,635
publicly reported attacks[^4] — surpassing 5,223 in 2023. The financial demands
of ransomware actors have also reached unprecedented levels, exemplified
by a record USD 75 million payment made to the Dark Angels ransomware
group in March 2024. These escalating ransom demands highlight the
increasing boldness and sophistication of threat actors, who are leveraging
advanced tools and techniques to maximize their extortion efforts.

![Image: Dark Angel’s record-breaking ransom payment]

The landscape of ransomware and crypto crime is highly fluid, where today's
standards are subject to rapid evolution. A notable trend identified by TRM’s
threat intelligence team in 2024 was the decline in the use of cryptocurrency
mixers for laundering ransomware proceeds. Instead, threat actors are

[^4]: This analysis is based on ransomware leak site data available as of January 6, 2025, and excludes
underreported incidents.

increasingly leveraging cross-chain bridges to obfuscate transactions and
enable seamless cryptocurrency conversions before cashing out. Though
bitcoin remains the primary currency for ransomware payments, a substantial
portion of these funds is converted to other cryptocurrencies downstream. The
use of bridges provide a quicker and more efficient means of converting illicit
funds, while creating an illusion of greater anonymity for cybercriminals.

### New ransomware groups entered the field, while other existing groups rebranded

2024 saw the emergence of several new ransomware groups, including Brain
Cipher, dAn0n, DragonForce, Fog, Funksec, RansomHub, Sarcoma, and
Trinity. These groups have quickly gained notoriety for their sophisticated
tactics and successful attacks across various industries. For example, Trinity has
been associated with targeting critical infrastructure such as healthcare and
government organizations — including two healthcare providers based in the
United Kingdom and United States.

In addition to new entrants, several prominent ransomware groups rebranded
or shifted operations under new names to evade law enforcement scrutiny.
Notable examples include the resurgence of groups like Lynx (aka INC),
DennistheHitman (aka GlobeImposter), and Qilin (aka Agenda), which have
adopted innovative extortion methods to enhance their effectiveness.

The Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model continues to dominate the
ecosystem, empowering less-skilled actors to carry out high-impact attacks.
Affiliates have become increasingly adaptable, often switching between
platforms and groups, as evidenced by on-chain activity.

![Image: Ransomware affiliate consolidation address receiving payments from multiple variants]

While the ransomware landscape has traditionally been strongly associated
with Russian-speaking actors, especially at the administrator level, it has
diversified over the years. Groups are now incorporating affiliates from
geographies around the world with a wide spectrum of language skills.
For instance, DragonForce ransomware demonstrates this shift, with ties to
Northern or Central Asia, as suggested by audio recordings of its associated
actors on their TOR site.

Despite this change, Russian-speaking ransomware groups remain very active
— with some of the most sophisticated actors in the cybercriminal landscape.
Many of these groups are linked to high-profile attacks, leveraging advanced
encryption techniques, innovative extortion tactics, and RaaS models to scale
operations.

### Notable attacks in 2024 primarily targeted the technology, retail, and financial services sectors

Data leak sites have proliferated, serving as platforms for public shaming and
extortion. These sites are increasingly used in multi-layered extortion strategies,
adding pressure on victims to pay ransoms by posting victim names and
company details.

Ransomware attacks in 2024 continued to target critical sectors, causing
widespread disruption — with the top three sectors being technology,
manufacturing, and professional services[^5]. Trends leading into 2025 suggest
ransomware groups will continue to target healthcare and critical infrastructure,
supply chain vulnerabilities, and cloud service providers to maximize their
efficiency and impact.

-   Healthcare and critical infrastructure: Healthcare systems remain a prime
    target, with attacks causing significant disruptions to patient care and
    operations. Attacks against organizations like Change Healthcare and PIH
    Health underscore the vulnerability of critical services to cyber threats.

-   Supply chain compromises: Attackers have increasingly focused on vendors
    and service providers like CDK Global and Blue Yonder to maximize
    downstream impacts. This tactic has been particularly disruptive in the
    technology and manufacturing sectors, where dependencies are high.

-   Cloud service providers: High-profile attacks have targeted cloud service
    providers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive data and global service
    disruptions. In June 2024, data theft attacks targeted customers of the
    cloud data platform Snowflake, leading to breaches at companies like AT&T,
    Ticketmaster, and Santander Bank. Attackers obtained login credentials
    through infostealer malware, compromising sensitive customer data.

### International collaboration is critical in disrupting ransomware actors

In 2024, global efforts to combat ransomware included major international
collaborations like Operation Cronos, which disrupted LockBit's infrastructure,
and Operation Endgame, targeting ransomware networks across Europe.
The Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI) gathered 68 nations to enhance
strategies against ransomware, while sanctions targeted key figures in groups
like Evil Corp. Increased collaboration between public and private entities has
been instrumental in these successes. Real-time intelligence-sharing and joint

[^5]: This analysis is based on ransomware leak site data available as of January 6, 2025, and excludes
underreported incidents.

operations have expanded resources and allowed for the timely disruption
of ongoing attacks, highlighting the importance of strong partnerships in
combating ransomware.

## USD 2.2 billion was stolen in crypto-related hacks

In 2024, USD 2.2 billion was stolen in hacks and exploits — a 17% increase from
2023 — bringing the three-year total to over USD 7.7 billion. The crypto space
continues to grapple with evolving threats, with decentralized finance (DeFi)
protocols remaining prime targets. The average hack size stood at USD 14
million, reflecting both the sophistication and scale of modern breaches.

Infrastructure attacks (primarily private key and seed phrase compromises)
accounted for nearly 70% of stolen funds in 2024. These compromises are
common because private keys and seed phrases serve as the foundational
access credentials for crypto wallets and platforms. Hackers exploit poor storage
practices, conduct phishing campaigns, and deploy malware to gain access
to these sensitive credentials. Once the private key is stolen, the thief typically
transfers the funds to their own wallet — often obfuscating the trail using mixers,
tumblers, or other money-laundering techniques to evade detection.

The surge in hacking activity in 2024 highlights the evolving threat landscape
in the crypto space. With a 17% year-over-year increase in stolen funds and
North Korea’s outsized role in these attacks, the industry faces mounting
pressure to implement stronger security measures. The scale of North Korean
operations, combined with their reliance on private key and seed phrase theft,
underscores the need for innovation in securing digital assets and mitigating
state-sponsored cyber threats.

### North Korea stole nearly USD 800 million of cryptocurrency

North Korea accounted for approximately 35% of all stolen funds in 2024,
approaching nearly USD 800 million in stolen cryptocurrency (including only
attacks for which TRM has moderate or higher confidence). On average,
North Korean attacks were nearly 5 times larger than those by other actors,
underscoring their emphasis on high-impact operations. Their primary method
— stealing private keys and seed phrases — highlights the urgent need for robust
key management solutions.

Pressure from US and international law enforcement on the crypto mixing
industry led to the shutdown of key services like Samourai Wallet and
Wasabi's original coordinator. In their place, North Korea has turned
to smaller services like JoinMarket, Mixero, and the new, independent
coordinators for Wasabi's protocol.

Law enforcement continues to face steep hurdles blocking and recovering
stolen funds. North Korea, and the laundering groups it works with, have
increased and diversified the number of bridges and blockchains they use
to move crypto assets. Many of these services are truly decentralized and
incapable of freezing stolen funds as they transit their protocols. The movement
of many of these funds from theft addresses to ultimate disposition with likely
brokers, mostly on the TRON blockchain, often occurs within the space of hours.
The speed and efficiency of these transfers make freezes by law enforcement
extremely challenging; TRM's analysis of recent thefts suggests frictional losses
to freezes or other interdictions by government remain small.

## Scam and fraud volumes declined, but remain a significant threat in the cryptosphere

In 2024, funds sent to fraud amounted to at least USD 10.7 billion, representing
a 40% decrease from 2023. This continued the decline from 2022, a year when
funds sent to Ponzi schemes and financial grooming schemes (commonly
referred to as "pig butchering" scams) reached an all-time high of about USD
16.8 billion.

As with all types of crypto crime discussed in this report, TRM’s coverage of
fraud in 2024 will rise over time as more instances are found. Fraud numbers
appear to be much more affected than other crimes, likely due to delayed fraud
reporting by victims. Accordingly, TRM assesses that fraud volumes likely still
declined in 2024, but not nearly as sharply as the data currently shows.

### Fewer Ponzi and pyramid schemes received over USD 100 million

Approximately 45% of the decrease in 2024 fraud volume appears to be
driven by a decrease in flows to apparent Ponzi and pyramid schemes. These
schemes received a total of USD 4.3 billion in funds from victims, marking a
37% decrease from 2023 inflows. While this fraud typology remains popular,
and hundreds are still being created every month (targeting victims in diverse
regions such as the United States, Argentina, South Korea, the United Kingdom,
Italy, Cyprus, and the Philippines), TRM did not see as many large schemes
receiving over USD 100 million as in previous years (six in 2024 vs. 14 in 2023),
which had volumes disproportionately driven by a handful of massive schemes.

Ponzi and pyramid schemes rely on word-of-mouth, marketing, and social
networks in order to become popular and yield large losses. They can obtain
a level of virality similar to other types of social media activity via both off- and
online methods that can supercharge a scheme — taking it from a scheme that
receives USD 5 million in inflows to one receiving hundreds of millions of dollars.

This does not appear to have happened as often in 2024 as in previous years.
Much like determining why particular social media posts “go viral” and others
don’t, it is difficult to say why no schemes appear to have “gone as viral” in 2024
as in previous years. It could be that people are more aware of such fraudulent
schemes and did not fall for them as much. Or, recruitment into and marketing of
these schemes could have moved offline or to private messaging, making them
more difficult to find and track.

### Self-reported instances of fraud remain high

Though the overall volume for fraud dipped, TRM still saw thousands of new
investment scam and phishing websites being deployed each month, and
received thousands of reports from Chainabuse, the largest publicly available
reporting platform for illicit crypto activity.

Incoming volume to addresses reported on Chainabuse appeared to remain
steady in 2024 — and at relatively high volumes compared to earlier years.

Finally, reported fraudulent activity on Chainabuse matches TRM internal
data showing that bitcoin is the most common payment method requested
by scammers — though its dominance has decreased over time.

### Financial grooming, or “pig butchering” scams, received more than USD 2.5 billion in 2024

Financial grooming scams, also known as “pig butchering,” experienced a
significant decline in 2024. Addresses associated with this fraud typology
received at least an estimated USD 2.5 billion, a possible 58% decrease from
2023. This total is very likely an undercount of the true number, as many victims
do not report their losses — and even fewer report their experiences publicly.

TRM attributes this reduction, in part, to heightened law enforcement efforts
worldwide. For example, the number of freezes of USDT (historically the
cryptocurrency of choice for financial groomers) increased substantially in late
2023 and continued in 2024.

TRM analysis also revealed fewer high-volume financial grooming entities
active in 2024 compared to 2023. This decline is likely a combination of the
aforementioned enforcement actions, along with increased awareness, delayed
reporting, and shifts in fraudsters’ tactics.

-   Increased awareness: News media and social media users have been
    publishing stories relating to victims’ large losses, the method of the scam,
    and its connection to transnational organized crime and human trafficking all
    throughout 2023 and 2024. The more people are aware of this scheme, the
    harder it is for the scammers to find victims.

-   Delayed reporting: It frequently takes time — often many months — for
    victims to report scam losses, if they report at all. TRM will continue to
    attribute more volume to specific typologies over time as more known scam
    instances are found. For example, in TRM’s 2023 Illicit Crypto Economy
    report, our estimate for funds received by financial grooming addresses
    was approximately USD 4.4 billion. Today, we assess this 2023 figure to be
    approximately USD 6.0 billion.

-   Shifting fraudster tactics: TRM has observed that fraudsters’ money
    movements have changed. Fraudsters appear to be using DAI more than
    they had in 2023, perhaps in response to more frequent USDT seizures. They
    also appear to be using more varied decentralized services and are bridging
    funds via decentralized services more often than in the past.

Unfortunately, the publicly-reported connection between financial grooming
and forced scamming appears to still be live. Addresses known to be used for
ransom payments facilitating the rescue of forced scamming victims continued
to receive several million dollars of inflows in 2024.

### Threat actors increasingly leveraged AI to defraud victims

TRM saw fraudsters use AI in multiple ways in 2024. Financial groomers and
other scammers use large language models (LLMs) to:

-   More easily create personas customized to the area in which their targeted
    victim resides, and to have more realistic conversations

-   Create live voice and video deepfakes of famous individuals (or of victims’
    relatives or CEOs) to trick victims to invest money, pay an invoice, or make a
    hostage payment

-   Send a higher quantity of (and better quality of) phishing messages

-   Create pornographic images of individuals in order to extort them

-   Create fake personas to bypass Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements

TRM believes criminals of all kinds will heavily expand their use of AI in 2025,
and is working to counter this grave threat.

## Illicit drug sales continued to grow and expand outside of the darknet marketplace ecosystems

Cryptocurrency-enabled online sales of illicit drugs saw a year-on-year growth
of over 19% between 2023 and 2024, nearing USD 2.4 billion.

2024 saw 42% fewer new darknet marketplaces (DNMs) launched year over
year, with the proportion of Monero-only DNMs launched increasing from little
more than a third in 2023 to nearly half in 2024.

### Drug sales are continuing to move to encrypted chat and social media platforms in the West

Over the last year, the online illicit drug trade has continued to decentralize
away from darknet markets and towards encrypted chat and social media
platforms. This trend, already prevalent in Western communities, has been
increasingly seen in the Russian-language ecosystem as well.

Vendors today are choosing to establish vendor shops and engage in direct
deals through a diverse array of encrypted communication applications
and email. These platforms allow vendors to reach customers who are less
technologically savvy, whilst also mitigating against market turbulence caused
by darknet market exit scams or law enforcement takedowns. In this respect, the
use of encrypted communication apps like Telegram and Signal have reduced
the barriers to access for drug buyers to purchase products online, whilst also
reducing fees that vendors pay to darknet markets for sales. This migration is
further bolstered by the fact that the majority of new Western DNMs launched
in 2024 have been characterized by poor design features or security issues.

The reduction in the quality and user numbers of Western DNMs stands in
contrast to the Russian-language ecosystem, where fierce competition and
high profits are driving innovation. Russian darknet market admins are now
experimenting with developments including artificial intelligence-facilitated
dispute resolution, closer integration with encrypted communication
applications, incentive programs, harm reduction, UX customization, and
aggressive marketing campaigns across digital and physical spaces.

### Russian language darknet marketplaces continue to drive overall volume of illicit drug sales

Despite the many challenges faced by darknet marketplaces over the course
of 2024, these platforms have nevertheless seen a slight increase of income
compared to 2023, generating more than USD 1.7 billion.

Keeping to the trend witnessed in 2023, Russian-language darknet
marketplaces continue to be responsible for the vast majority of revenue
generated, contributing over 97% to the overall volume of illicit drug sales (up
more than 1% from 2023) in bitcoin and TRON.

The lower threat of action from Russian law enforcement — coupled with the
dead drop-based delivery model (read more here), focus on synthetic drugs
(such as alpha-PVP and mephedrone, which can be produced locally), and the
wide availability and low price of drug precursor chemicals typically imported
from China — have enabled Russian-language darknet marketplaces to thrive.

Only four Russian-language DNMs left the approximately 20-strong ecosystem
in 2024. The departure of market leaders such as Solaris Market — which
ceased operations in autumn 2024 — is a rare occurrence. And while there have
been no more successful law enforcement takedowns of Russian-language
DNMs since the fall of Hydra Market in April 2022, the administrators of these
platforms also avoid exit scams (typical of the Western DNM ecosystem),
preferring instead to voluntarily cease operations and allow all users to
withdraw their funds from the marketplace escrow.

### Western darknet marketplaces struggled under sustained law enforcement action and exit scams

In contrast to Russian-language DNMs, Western darknet marketplaces
continued to struggle throughout 2024 as a result of sustained law
enforcement action, coupled with several high profile exit scams.

This has curtailed user confidence and stunted the ecosystem's growth,
creating a climate of distrust that is reminiscent of the aftermath of Op.
Onymous (the law enforcement takedown of the Silk Road 2.0 darknet
marketplace together with a host of smaller DNMs in 2014) and Op. Bayonet/
GraveSac (the coordinated takedown of the AlphaBay and Hansa Market
darknet marketplaces by US and European law enforcement in 2017), which left
the Western DNM ecosystem reeling.

After the disappearance of Bohemia Market (a prolific Western DNM) and
Cannabia Market (its sister market) in a suspected exit scam in January 2024
(later revealed by the Dutch authorities to have been under investigation),
the community witnessed the exit scam of Incognito Market in March 2024.
This incident also marked the never-before-seen attempt of its administrator,
Pharoah (arrested in May 2024 and revealed to be 23 year-old Taiwanese
national Rui-Siang Lin), to extort the marketplace’s users.

This crisis was further compounded by the seizure of Nemesis Market by German
law enforcement in March 2024, as well as the exits of other important and
trusted players including Cypher Market (which disappeared in April 2024) and
GoFish Market (September 2024), which had even been included in the Superlist
of marketplaces trusted by the community.

Nevertheless, the Western DNM ecosystem experienced some innovation in
spite of recent enforcement actions. Amongst the most notable was the first
merger and acquisition between two marketplaces on the darknet — whereby
the struggling SuperMarket was absorbed by the now-Superlisted DrugHub in
an operation that lasted around one month. 2024
