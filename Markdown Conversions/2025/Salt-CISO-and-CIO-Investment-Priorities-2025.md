WHITE PAPERCISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

Executive summary
CISOs and CIOs are prioritizing cloud infrastructure security, internal cybersecurity
talent, and the ethical control of data in 2025. The threat environment continues to
change, with AI-driven cyberthreats escalating the potential damages on the
offensive side in parallel with tightening cybersecurity insurance requirements
forcing a recalibration of the defensive side.

More organizations are experiencing a higher number of cybersecurity incidents
each year, which drives the need to re-assess the efficacy of current posture against
the organization’s desired standard of performance. Having done so, the CISOs and
CIOs in this research are investing in protections to shore up the critical areas
above. In addition to the overall prioritization of cybersecurity areas, we offer a
more nuanced analysis of CISO and CIO priorities within the areas of applications,
cloud platforms and services, identities, and data.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The key takeaways from this research are:

•  Cybersecurity driven by changing threat response calculus

Increasing prices for cybersecurity insurance, the growing use of AI in
cyberattacks, software supply chain compromise, and return-to-office
mandates for employees are the top trends and challenges driving how CISOs
and CIOs approach cybersecurity in 2025. All force a reevaluation of how best
to address current and emerging threats.

•  Cloud infrastructure security, cybersecurity talent availability, and control and

ethical processing of data top the priority stack
Out of 24 potential investment areas for cybersecurity, two thirds of
organizations assigned the highest priority to cloud infrastructure, internal
cybersecurity talent, and compliant data processing. They see weaknesses in
their current posture that are misaligned with where they want to be and are
investing the resources to do something about it.

•  Budgets continue to rise, showing resilience across economic cycles

Almost all organizations have received a higher budget for cybersecurity over
the previous two years, and most believe they could put even more budget to
productive and effective use.

•

Strong risk management disciplines make a significant difference
Organizations with higher efficacy in managing the business risks associated
with key cybersecurity areas such as applications, cloud, and identities show
much higher commitment to address security weaknesses and are spending
accordingly. Being able to see what is and isn’t happening drives change.

•  Organizations must do the work to understand their priorities

Investment priorities for any given organization must be set within the context
of their current posture, real-world threat data, and known areas of concern
(and unknown areas of weakness). This is the fundamental work that
cybersecurity decision-makers and influencers must coordinate.

METHODOLOGY
The data presented in this white paper is based on a survey of 268 CISO or CIO
respondents at organizations in the United States with more than 1,000 employees.
Methodology details and respondent breakdowns are provided on page 33.

WHAT IS AN “INVESTMENT PRIORITY?”
This research presents a deep dive into investment priorities for cybersecurity in
2025. To do so, we analyzed the data collected from the CISO and CIO respondents
to our survey in line with two principles:

•

Evidence of alignment essential
Merely espousing something as a priority was not enough. Among the survey
responses, we looked for alignment with both current posture and intended
expenditure before labeling something as a priority. For example, if an
investment area was stated as a priority in one question but there was no
sense of concern around current shortcomings nor an expressed intent to
address the area through financial investment in other questions, we didn’t
give it the “priority” label.

•  Merely spending more does not make something a priority, just as merely

spending less does not necessarily render something not a priority
The level of spending required depends on the current state and what is
needed. It is the gap between the two which says what investment is required,
and in the case where an organization needs to double its expenditure to reach
its desired state, doing significantly less than that indicates it is not a priority in
any given year.

COMPARISONS WITH OUR 2023 RESEARCH
This is our second biannual research on CISO and CIO investment priorities for
cybersecurity. The first was published two years ago in February 2023—see CISO
and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2023. All comparisons to our
previous research on this topic are against this 2023 report.

The majority of the data in this current report and our 2023 report provide a look-
forward perspective on investment priorities for the coming year. The data from
one question in both research cycles—on cybersecurity incident types
experienced—profiles experiences from the previous 12 months; it is look-back
data. For accuracy, these are referenced as data from calendar year 2022 and
calendar year 2024.

Cybersecurity incident types
Of all potential indicators for assessing the efficacy of current posture, a
cybersecurity incident provides the strongest evidence of vulnerability. Incidents
are a costly and disruptive signal that current security protections are insufficient.
Our research found:

•

•

72% of organizations experienced three or more types of cybersecurity
incidents over the previous 12 months (during calendar year 2024), up slightly
from 70% in our 2023 research report (highlighting incidents from calendar
year 2022).1 In both time periods, we asked about the types of incidents
experienced, not the number of incidents within each type.

The shape of the incident type count graph is similar across both time periods,
although fewer organizations in our latest research indicated four or fewer
incident types. More organizations are experiencing a higher number of incident
types; the trend line is moving in the wrong direction.

See Figure 1.

The most frequently occurring types of incidents during the past 12 months were:

•

•

•

For one in three organizations
Cyberattack against a cloud service.

For one in four organizations
Ransomware attack that encrypted data, misconfigured identity and access
management systems, supply chain attack, and ransomware attack that
exfiltrated data.

For one in five organizations
Fined for not complying with data privacy regulations, breach of sensitive
employee data, and making a ransom payment after a ransomware attack.

See Figure 2, which excludes five incident types occurring at less than 7% of
organizations, e.g., threat actor bypassing safety features of AI-enabled cyber defenses.

Trends, challenges, priorities
We explore the trends and challenges driving cybersecurity’s prioritization in 2025.

TRENDS AND CHALLENGES DRIVING CYBERSECURITY
CISOs and CIOs are closely aligned in how they assess the impact of many trends
and challenges on cybersecurity in 2025. Two trends top the list with 83% of all
respondents indicating a “very impactful” or “extremely impactful” rating. The
increasing cost of cybersecurity insurance premiums is followed closely by the
growing use of AI in cyberattacks. See Figure 3.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

The top four trends and their impact on cybersecurity are:

•

•

The increasing cost of cybersecurity insurance premiums
Higher premium costs and elevated minimum requirements for securing
coverage push organizations to rebalance where their cybersecurity budget is
spent. Few organizations could now afford to rely on cybersecurity insurance
alone, even if that were a possibility. If security protections and resilience are
weak, potential insurers are unwilling to extend coverage at affordable rates—
if at all. This prices the cost of inaction and low efficacy in stark terms for
organizations. More CISOs rated this trend or challenge as highly impactful
compared to CIOs, indicating the higher relative responsibility carried for
addressing systemic issues. This trend has increased in impact from fourth
overall in our 2023 research to first place this year.

The growing use of AI in cyberattacks
That cybercriminals are already using AI in cyberattacks is widely recognized,2
but how far that usage will extend is uncharted territory for most.
Organizations are already investing in AI-powered cyber defenses to mitigate
growing threats. Still, the net effect of escalating offensive threats against an
increasingly AI-powered defensive posture has not yet played out sufficiently.
CISOs and CIOs rate this challenge almost equally. We did not ask about this
challenge in our 2023 research program.

•  Compromise of software supplied by partners and other third parties and

return-to-office mandates for employees (tied for third)
Two trends or challenges tied for third place overall. CISOs and CIOs ranked one
equally: the compromise of software supplied by partners and other third
parties. During 2024, the CrowdStrike incident bore witness to the devastating
consequences of trusted partners getting something wrong. The other trend
tied for third place is return-to-office mandates for employees, which CIOs view
as more highly impactful than CISOs.

CISOs and CIOs provided almost equal ratings for half of the trends. Among the
other half, the most significant differences were for:

•  Ongoing business disruption from COVID, which CIOs rated 10% higher than

CISOs (72% versus 62%).

•  Return-to-office mandates for employees, with a 9% higher rating by CIOs than

CISOs (82% versus 73%).

•

Increasing cost of cybersecurity insurance premiums, with a 7% higher rating
among CISOs (as discussed above).

These variations may reflect enduring role-specific differences between CISOs and
CIOs or signal areas where each can better assist the other. For example, a CISO
could initiate a conversation with the CIO to see if there are cybersecurity aspects
to ongoing COVID disruptions and return-to-office mandates that the CISO is
systematically under-addressing. Likewise, if there are aspects of DevOps where
security considerations are under-addressed that negatively impact cyber insurance
requirements for the CISO, a conversation with the CIO would be prudent.

PRIORITIZING CYBERSECURITY ISSUES HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL
Given the continued rise of cyberthreats, the growing menace of AI-enabled
cyberattacks, the devastating consequences of triple-threat ransomware attacks,
and massive data breaches that resulted in the victim organization filing for
bankruptcy (e.g., National Public Data), it would take a brave CISO or CIO to dismiss
the importance of cybersecurity to their organization’s success. The data from this
research shows this is not happening. Addressing cybersecurity issues is already a
high or extreme priority at more than nine out of ten organizations, with continued
growth in priority anticipated over the next two years. See Figure 4.

Figure 4

Percentage of respondents indicating “high priority” or “extreme priority”

In looking at the data:

•

•

The composition of priority is shifting dramatically
More CISOs and CIOs ranked priority as “high” in January 2023 rather than
“extreme.” For both respondent groups, however, this switched for the January
2025 and 2027 rankings, with more indicating “extreme priority.” Among
CISOs, almost two thirds said “high” for 2023 but “extreme” for 2027.

The level of priority rose more than anticipated two years ago
Our previous research assessing cybersecurity investment priorities saw CISOs
and CIOs forecasting only a marginal uplift in cybersecurity priority within their
organizations over the subsequent two years, from an average of 77%
indicating the two highest importance rankings to 81%. We wrote at the time
that “neither CISOs nor CIOs are currently able to perceive that cybersecurity
could still become significantly more important than it is today.” In retrospect,
another conclusion would have been better: that neither CISOs nor CIOs could
perceive that the attention paid to cybersecurity issues within their
organization could be significantly higher. On the tail of SolarWinds, multiple
global Exchange Server incidents, and the shock of crippling ransomware
attacks against critical infrastructure organizations, many assessed their
organizations as nearing maximum attentional capacity two years ago.

Assessing investment priorities against
cybersecurity posture
In this section, we analyze respondents’ assessment of their cybersecurity posture
in 24 areas and the investment required to improve posture.

METHODOLOGY
We asked respondents to provide an assessment of their current cybersecurity
posture in 24 areas. For each area, we asked three numerical rating questions:

1.  Level of concern about current posture

The level of concern with the current cybersecurity posture of a given area at
their organization, e.g., security of endpoints. Each respondent was asked to
answer the question based on how their organization approached each area—
that is, against their own internal framework, standard, or baseline. The
question did not seek any assessment against an external framework or
imposed baseline. Respondents had to balance their assessment of current
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for each of the 24 areas.

2.  Level of investment required to meet the organization’s standard or desired

level of posture
The level of investment required to raise the cybersecurity posture of a given
area to the internal standard or framework set by their organization. This
question was phrased as an internal rating rather than seeking alignment with
any universal standard, external framework, or imposed baseline. Hence, in
conjunction with the first question, respondents defined investment required
against their own internal assessment of the current and desired state.

3.  Level of priority in 2025 of investing in each area

The level of priority within the organization for improving the cybersecurity
posture of a given area in 2025.

CORRELATING CONCERN, INVESTMENT LEVELS, AND PRIORITY IN 2025
The data in Figure 6 above presents the raw data for investment priorities in 2025.
To analyze investment intent more deeply, we correlated the answers to the three
questions assessing concern, required investment, and investment priority. We
divided the responses to the three questions into two groups each, creating eight
combinations. See Figure 8.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

Comparing the raw prioritization of the Top 7 in Figure 6 with the correlated
analysis in Figure 10 leaves several priorities unchanged but others moderately to
dramatically different. Key changes are:

•  Prioritization remains unchanged for both cloud areas

Security of cloud infrastructure ranks first in both lists, and security of cloud
apps/services ranks sixth in both lists. These are the only two items that remain
unchanged in relative rank ordering between the lists.

•

Three priorities fell off the Top 7 list based on correlated ratings
Security of data used for training AI models drops from second in the Top 7 to
eighth in the correlated list, and post-incident recovery resilience of employees
not in cybersecurity roles drops from fifth in the Top 7 to ninth. The most
dramatic change is for the efficacy of the incident response process, which
dives from third in the Top 7 to 16th. For each of these, while the priority is
asserted, we don’t see the flow-through from current concern around posture
nor intended budgetary adjustments. For some organizations, the reason could
be that knowing what to do to address weaker areas is unclear. For example,
securing data used for training AI models is still an emerging area with a lot of
uncertainty around which products work best. Market education, product
maturity, and ranking vendors takes time to get right, but once there,
investment decisions and associated budgetary implications are easier.

•

Three priorities join the correlated ratings list that aren’t on the Top 7
Three areas that didn’t make the Top 7 are highly rated on the correlated list.
Availability of cybersecurity talent for internal roles is in second place, and level
of control and ethical processing of data in third. Network security also joins
the correlated list, in seventh place.

•  Data discovery and classification becomes more important

The ability to discover and classify data moves from seventh place in the Top 7
to fourth in the correlated list. It sits directly after a related area—the level of
control and ethical processing of data (in third place, as above). It has become
essential for organizations to be able to discover and classify data in response
to a changing regulatory environment where greater differentiation of data
types is required.

DISCUSSION
Some priorities are quickly espoused. Others become clearer only when contextual
reasoning and intended consequential actions align. This research shows the
enduring importance of strengthening cloud security (for infrastructure primarily,
and apps/services secondarily), having the right people in cybersecurity roles, and
upleveling various aspects of data security. These are the major themes and
priorities for 2025.

Having the right people in cybersecurity roles is necessary but insufficient in the
ongoing fight against cybersecurity threats. Organizations cannot solely hire their
way to success, because there aren’t enough people or resources available to do so.
Having the right tools, technologies, mitigations, and protections available to
deflect attacks, provide early warning signals, and enable resilient recovery are
equally essential. The two go together.

Budget outlook
The predominant pattern is higher budgets year on year, with the greatest
frequency of increase for the 2024 to 2025 years (at 98.5% of organizations). The
percentage of respondents expecting a higher budget in 2026 compared to 2025 is
slightly lower, although still very high. See Figure 11.

Source: Osterman Research (2025)

The most surprising budget finding is that when asked about their dream or ideal
budget for 2025—assuming every dollar could be put to productive and effective
use—only 70.9% wanted a higher budget. In other words, almost 30% wanted the
same or less, and the data says those wanting less were twice the amount of those
wanting the same. By comparison, in our 2023 research, the percentage wanting a
higher dream budget was the highest of the three data sets. Speculatively, this
could represent financial fatigue at the relentless growth in cybersecurity budgets, a
preference for shifting to platform offerings that combine multiple point solutions
at a lower overall net cost, or an acknowledgement—at least among some
organizations—that they hit maximum absorption capacity for new cybersecurity
solutions for the time being. We will need another cycle of research data to
determine if this is a trend or a blip in normal operations.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

Four areas of focus for 2025
In the following sections, we investigate investment priorities for CISOs and CIOs in
four focus areas. This section talks methodology for that analysis.

DIGGING DEEPER
Complementary to the assessment of overall posture, required investment, and
investment priority in 2025 in the opening sections above, we asked respondents to
provide deeper insight into their security posture and investment priorities in four
specific areas. These were chosen for their importance to cybersecurity in 2025. The
four areas are applications, cloud platforms and services, identities, and data.

METHODOLOGY
For each of the four areas, we asked respondents to provide a rating across three
related questions:

•

Efficacy at managing the associated business risks
For each topic or issue in the focus area, we asked for a rating of how well the
organization is currently managing the associated business risks. The “business
risks” as such were not defined, leaving it up to each respondent to answer in
terms of the visibility and optics into the business risks seen at their
organization. Respondents answered on a five-point scale: poor, fair, good,
very good, and excellent.

•  Priority of security in 2025

For each topic or issue, we asked for a rating of how the organization is
prioritizing security in 2025. Respondents answered on a five-point scale: not a
priority, low, medium, high, and extreme.

•  Budget change in 2025 compared to 2024

For each of the topics or issues within the focus area, we asked for a rating of
how the budget allocated to the topic is changing in 2025 compared to 2024.
Respondents answered on a seven-point scale, ranging from a budget decrease
of 20% or more to a budget increase of 20% or more.

In the subsequent four sections, we present the following analysis for each area:

•  Overall risk management posture, priorities, and budget change

Across all organizations and on average, what is the overall level of risk
management efficacy, security priority, and budget change in 2025? These
answers present an overall picture of the data without correlating the answers
for each respondent.

•  Correlating risk management posture with priorities and budget change

The current assessment of risk management efficacy is used to split the data on
priorities and budget change in 2025. Correlating the answers in this way
provides a different view of the data than the overall one. A near-universal
finding across the four focus areas is that organizations with higher risk
management efficacy place higher priority on security in 2025 and are
allocating a greater budget increase as well. By implication, organizations with
a lower rating of risk management efficacy manifest lower priority and a lower
intent to invest in improvements in 2025.

A discussion on each area follows the quantitative analysis.

Applications

Focusing on API security is essential due to
the specific vulnerabilities they pose and the
serious repercussions of API breaches,
such as data loss and financial harm

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

TOPICS FOR APPLICATIONS
We investigated six topics in the applications focus area:

•  Assessing security vulnerabilities when introducing new applications.

•

Ensuring data is kept safe when migrating away from legacy or unused applications.

•  Developing APIs without introducing new security risks.

•  Discovering APIs as they are developed.

•  Managing API security posture across our organization.

•

Preventing data from leaking from an application to other applications with
reduced security.

OVERALL PRIORITIES IN 2025
In looking at the rankings given to the six issues (see Figure 12):

•  Risk management efficacy is evenly distributed across the six issues, with only a

net variation of 10%. Highest efficacy is for discovering APIs as they are
created. Lowest is ensuring data is kept safe when migrating away from legacy
or unused applications.

•

•

Spending priority is highest for preventing data leakage, discovering APIs as
they are created, and assessing security vulnerabilities when new applications
are introduced. The second and third of these issues are about promptly
detecting changing conditions in the design and functioning of applications.

Two of the API-related issues have the highest anticipated budget increase:
developing APIs (17% of respondents expected a budget increase of more than
10%) and discovering APIs as they are created (15%).

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

CORRELATING RISK POSTURE WITH PRIORITIES AND BUDGET CHANGE
There is a dramatic difference in investment priorities and anticipated budget
increases between organizations that are and are not appropriately managing the
business risks of each issue. Organizations that are managing the business risks well
place higher priority on each issue in 2025. They have also allocated a larger budget
increase in all but one situation—preventing data from leaking from an application
to other applications with reduced security.

The data in this research positions two of the three API issues as high priority in
2025 and with the largest anticipated budget increases out of the six issues. APIs
are critical to modern application design and functioning. Being able to securely
develop and discover APIs as they are developed are ranked more highly than
managing API security posture as such. API security posture can be managed to
some extent by strengthening the guardrails for the other two issues, and hence
the relative ratings make sense to some degree. But it is vital to understand that
API security posture governance extends beyond just reducing risks during
development. Continuous monitoring and safeguarding of APIs in production are
key to identifying and addressing threats as they arise. This encompasses the
integration of runtime protection, mechanisms for threat detection, and
automated response capabilities to maintain continuous API security. Organizations
would be shortsighted to ignore API security posture entirely, but the data in this
research doesn’t support that conclusion. API security posture attracts a somewhat
lower prioritization, not outright abandonment.

See Figure 13.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

Only 29% of respondents say their organization is “very good” or “excellent” at
managing the business risks for all six application-related issues we asked about. The
majority (71%) have differing levels of risk management efficacy across the six issues.

DISCUSSION ON INVESTMENT PRIORITIES FOR APPLICATIONS IN 2025
Under both ways we examined the data, the organizations in this research place
high priority on the ability to promptly detect changing conditions in the design and
functioning of applications. This means the ability to assess vulnerabilities when net
new applications are introduced to the organization, and to minimize security risks
when application design constructs—such as APIs—are created or updated. This
includes the ability to identify and secure hidden or unmanaged APIs (“shadow
APIs”), which represent a significant security risk to organizations.

With new AI coding assistants being increasingly used across DevOps teams, the
velocity of developing new APIs and code is dramatically increased. By implication,
so too is the risk of introducing vulnerabilities that bypass access controls, give
access to commercially sensitive process logic, and allow unauthorized access to
data for breach and extortion attacks. AI coding assistants can only generate APIs
and other code based on underlying training data, and any prominence of security
weaknesses in training data gets perpetuated in future development cycles.

The risks and threats against APIs are reflected in the OWASP API Security Top 10
list for 2023,3 which identifies prevalent API vulnerabilities like broken
authentication, excessive data exposure, and security misconfiguration. These
weaknesses can be targeted by attackers seeking unauthorized access to
confidential data and systems. Focusing on API security is essential due to the
specific vulnerabilities they pose and the serious repercussions of API breaches,
such as data loss and financial harm.

AI-driven API security solutions offer organizations a way to level up their API
security posture. AI-driven solutions can analyze API traffic, identify anomalies, and
detect threats in real-time, providing crucial defense against advanced attacks.
Integrating AI into API security helps organizations manage the complexity of
modern development and protect its vital assets.

Migration of data away from legacy or unused applications ranked in last place for
efficacy at managing the associated business risks well. It also had the second to
lowest budget increase across the collection of topics we investigated. One
possibility is that organizations have largely completed their digital transformation
efforts and legacy applications are a minor issue, and therefore it is of lower relative
priority. Another possibility is that organizations are blind to what’s happening with
legacy and unused applications and the data stored inside, creating an exposed and
uncontrolled vector for data breach. It would be good for organizations to double-
check if unsure.

Cloud platforms
and services

Cyberattacks against a cloud service were the
most common incident type respondents
experienced. Organizations with good risk
management capabilities are all in on dealing
with everything that needs to be strengthened to
make the cloud as secure as possible.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

TOPICS FOR CLOUD PLATFORMS AND SERVICES
Cloud incidents and the prioritization of cloud security feature prominently in this
research. In taking a deeper look at the cloud, we asked respondents about six
topics:

•

The use of shared passwords when accessing cloud platforms and services.

•  Managing configuration of access rights on cloud platforms and services to

prevent unauthorized access to data, including the difference between up-to-
date access rights and MFA protections.

•  Addressing inconsistencies between security capabilities (and hence diverging
security policies) when using multiple cloud platforms to host applications.

•

•

Finding appropriately trained cybersecurity talent to protect cloud platforms
and services.

Implementing data-centric security to protect sensitive data in use for secure
data portability and sharing across multiple cloud platforms.

OVERALL PRIORITIES IN 2025: CLOUD PLATFORMS AND SERVICES
In looking at the rankings across the six issues (see Figure 14):

•  Risk management efficacy is lowest for the two issues related to access rights—
having them up to date and protecting access with MFA. Access rights are a
fundamental control and weakness in this area is highly concerning.

•

•

Spending priority is highest for data-centric security. This is unsurprising given
the frequency of data breaches affecting cloud platforms and services.

The budget numbers are essentially the same (ranges 33% to 39%).

CORRELATING RISK POSTURE WITH PRIORITIES AND BUDGET CHANGE:
CLOUD PLATFORMS AND SERVICES
When splitting the data on cloud investment priorities and budget increases based
on risk management efficacy, the anticipated variation in priorities remains. In all
cases, those managing risks well place a higher priority on all six issues (average
85% versus 54%). For anticipated budget increases across the six issues, however,
current efficacy drives less of a differentiation (average 38% versus 30%). In other
words, irrespective of how well organizations are currently managing the risks of
cloud platforms and services, the general intent is to increase budget in 2025 for all
the issues we asked about. See Figure 15.

Among organizations who are currently managing risks well, there is little variation
in the priority given to the six issues, and little variation in budget allocations, too.
They are all in—dealing with everything that needs to be strengthened to make the
cloud as secure as possible. By contrast, among those not currently managing risks
well, there’s a greater degree of variation in priorities. Highest priorities are data-
centric security (72%), cloud talent (65%), and consistent security policies (64%).
Lower priorities are identity and access. For this group, choosing the best cloud
platforms available and having the talent to run it is essential, but without the
operationalization of security through strong identity and access, much is lost.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

DISCUSSION ON INVESTMENT PRIORITIES FOR CLOUD PLATFORMS
AND SERVICES IN 2025
Cloud represents a significant strategic bet for most organizations, and by
implication, security needs to be as well. With cyberattacks against a cloud service
the most common incident type experienced by the organizations in this
research—affecting one out of three organizations during the past 12 months—and
with other incident types giving access to sensitive data for failings including
misconfigured access rights, organizations know they must do better.

The difference in rankings given to data-centric security and access rights in the
overall analysis (see Figure 14) feels backward. Why is a comparatively higher
priority put on securing data in the cloud for secure data portability (85%) versus
stopping unauthorized access to the cloud and its data (66%)? Isn’t that just like
leaving the front door open? The correlated analysis in Figure 15 provides a
potential answer: there’s a significant difference in access rights as a priority
among those that are managing risks well versus those not doing so. For this group,
priorities must be re-evaluated. It is insufficient to merely have the best cloud
platforms and talent available; matters pertaining to identity and access control are
fundamental.

Having the right talent available is rated as a high priority, but the details matter in
what that talent is then tasked with. Repetitive tasks should be the domain of
automated cloud security systems for operational efficiency, not cybersecurity
talent. Automation allows for consistent application of defined controls and real-
time re-alignment of configuration drift against established policies. Trying to
maintain this with human talent alone is a losing proposition.

The majority of respondents (71%) were not consistently good at managing the
business risks for all six issues related to cloud platforms and services. If some of
the issues we asked about are unimportant to a particular organization, then such
variation is appropriate. However, if the issues are all important, it would be good
to see investment in developing more consistent risk management practices across
the six. That should be a priority for organizations in itself.

Data-centric security managed independently of the cloud provider ensures secure
data portability and secure data sharing irrespective of the cloud in use. Moving
data from one cloud environment to another does not require the removal of
protection when independent security capabilities are used, unlike when cloud-
specific protections are embraced. As organizations embrace a multi-cloud posture
for resilience and business advantage, re-evaluating how to achieve cloud-
independent data security and policy adherence becomes a more significant issue.

Identities

A username and password alone for gaining
access to a resource, device, or application no
longer offers sufficient strength to prevent
unauthorized access.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

TOPICS FOR IDENTITIES
Compromised identities feature prominently in many cyberattacks. We asked about
eight identity-related issues in assessing investment priorities for this area:

•

•

•

Tightening identity requirements in three different ways.

Protecting against attacks that seek to compromise human identities.

Protecting against attacks that seek to compromise non-human identities.

•  Managing identity security posture.

•  Governing user identities and access rights.

•

Ensuring that credentials for offboarded employees are promptly revoked.

OVERALL PRIORITIES IN 2025: IDENTITIES
From an overall perspective for identities in 2025 (see Figure 16):

•  Around 80% of respondents claim high-risk management efficacy across all eight
issues. The notable exception is the lower rating for protecting against attacks
that seek to compromise human identities, such as phishing.

•

•

Investment priorities for six of the issues are relatively similar (average 77% for
issues 3 to 8 below). The data varies on which approach to take to MFA (issues
1 to 2 below). The priority for enforcing MFA for all applications is higher than
increasing the strength of MFA methods, e.g., adopting biometric devices.

The anticipated increase in budget numbers is very similar, with an average of
36% for the middle six issues below. MFA for all applications and revoking
credentials for departed employees are on the low end of the increase scale.

CORRELATING RISK POSTURE WITH PRIORITIES AND BUDGET CHANGE: IDENTITIES
Only 25% of respondents say their organization is “very good” or “excellent” at
managing the business risks for all the issues related to identities. Most (75%) have
differing levels of risk management efficacy. This low result could highlight why many
organizations struggle with detecting and stopping identity-based attacks.

Splitting the data on investment priorities and anticipated budget increases for
2025 by current risk management efficacy results in several issues being indifferent
to the correlation. The priority and anticipated budget increase for protecting
against credential compromise attacks of both human and non-human identities
are essentially the same, irrespective of current risk management efficacy. In other
words, all organizations know they need to do better as a matter of urgency,
irrespective of whether they have the risk management processes in place already.
Other issues in the list are similar but not the same, e.g., governing user identities
and tightening identity requirements with stronger MFA methods. This indifference
to current risk management efficacy is not seen to the same extent in the other
deep-dive areas in this research.

Protecting against identity attacks that seek to compromise non-human identities is
the only issue across all four areas where the security priority in 2025 is higher
among those not managing risks well compared to those who are. This is an
unaddressed issue for too many organizations, and the warning bells are sounding.

See Figure 17.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

DISCUSSION ON INVESTMENT PRIORITIES FOR IDENTITIES IN 2025
A username and password alone for gaining access to a resource, device, or
application no longer offers sufficient strength to prevent unauthorized access.
Credentials have been too easily compromised through phishing attacks in recent
decades, and unrelenting data breaches have given threat actors a treasure trove of
credentials that can be used in attacks. Mitigating or compensating controls on
credentials and their usage has become essential for organizations, and often
mandatory for some industries and any organization looking for cyber insurance
coverage. MFA is one example of a compensating control, and there are clear
signals in the data that senior leaders are placing priority in 2025 on widening the
usage of MFA and strengthening MFA devices. Passwordless is another
compensating control, and that too is attracting high interest and budgetary
investment in 2025. Finally, managing identity security posture—having the optics
to see who is logging in where and how and if there are abnormalities in patterns
that may signal malicious activity—is a third. Something must be added to the use
of a username and password, and the embrace of a multi-level defensive posture is
showing up in the data. These are positive movements.

Protecting non-human identities (e.g., service accounts) has received less cut-
through compared to human identities, and hence many organizations have
significantly lower optics and visibility into their risk factors. Such a situation is ideal
for threat actors. If they can compromise access to a service account—especially
ones that are highly privileged and where access patterns are not regularly
audited—the longer the potential footprint becomes for unauthorized data access
and subsequent lateral movement. In the data from this research, the priority for
protecting both human and non-human identities is closely aligned. This is a
promising sign that organizations are elevating attention on both.

Deactivating credentials for offboarded employees had the second highest priority
in both the overall chart and the correlated one for organizations that are managing
business risks well. Failing to close out the possibility of such credentials being used
raises the risk of surreptitious usage by threat actors and ex-employees alike.
Hardening offboarding controls and processes for identities prevents a whole set of
downstream compromise incidents.

Data

Classification for classification’s sake is a
less compelling proposition than using that
analysis to drive automated and elevated
protections over data.

CISO and CIO Investment Priorities for Cybersecurity in 2025

TOPICS FOR DATA
Data is targeted in many cyberattacks, as its exfiltration, unauthorized publication,
or threatened irreversible destruction has proven an effective method of financial
extortion. Data is always in the crosshairs; it’s the thing that threat actors are after.
We looked into six issues about data:

•  Data discovery, e.g., where data is stored

•  Automatic data classification, e.g., personal data subject to privacy regulations

•

Implementing data minimization, defensible data deletion, and data retention
in support of privacy compliance and risk reduction

•  Automatically protecting data, e.g., encrypting personal data subject to privacy

regulations

•

Implementing capabilities for preventing the exfiltration of data, e.g., to stop
the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property
(IP), classified information, and other sensitive information

•

The ability to restore data after a cyber incident

OVERALL PRIORITIES IN 2025: DATA
The overall viewpoint on data in 2025 is (see Figure 18):

•

•

•

In sum, risk management efficacy is fairly evenly distributed across the six issues.

The highest investment priorities in 2025 are data discovery and stopping data
exfiltration. There is often a relationship between these in attacks: exfiltrated
data was somewhere unknown.

There is not a lot of variation in the budget increase numbers (average 35%).

CORRELATING RISK POSTURE WITH PRIORITIES AND BUDGET CHANGE: DATA
Only 22% of respondents say their organization is “very good” or “excellent” at
managing the business risks for all the issues related to data. Most (78%) have
uneven levels of risk management efficacy across the six data issues. As data is
continually targeted in cyberattacks—by ransomware, data breaches, and as a
result of misconfigured access rights (see Figure 2 earlier)—strengthening these
controls is linked directly with shrinking the accessible attack space.

Among organizations managing risks well, there is slight variation around the
priority associated with the six data issues in 2025 (ranging from 75% to 86%).
Budgets, too, are similar, although the largest budget increases are targeted for
automatically protecting data with encryption and preventing data exfiltration. The
first often enables the second, or at minimum, eliminates the threat carried by the
second if the encryption approach can withstand brute-force decryption attempts.

Several budget increase comparatives have significant variations between those
managing risks well and those not doing so. The largest percentage variation is for
automatically protecting data with encryption (28%); the second largest is for data
discovery (25%). By contrast, some are much closer. The ability to restore all data
after a cyber incident has the smallest variation (10%), indicating that irrespective
of current risk management efficacy, being able to get back to business after a
cyber incident is highly important to many organizations.

See Figure 19.

DISCUSSION ON INVESTMENT PRIORITIES FOR DATA IN 2025
The relative priority around the two potential automatic actions taken on data is
interesting and something we saw in the 2023 research too. There is higher priority
for both groups of respondents in Figure 19—those managing risks well and those
not managing risks well—to automatically protect data with encryption rather than
merely automatically classifying data. There’s a strong case to be made for
strengthening data classification methods. Still, if that’s where it ends—in
classification only—it’s not as compelling as using that classification to drive
automated and elevated protections over data. Encryption is a key contender for
reducing the fallout from data breaches.

Conclusion
The priorities presented in this white paper around cloud, talent, and data reflect a
snapshot of representative organizations in the United States for the 2025 calendar
year. The CISO and CIO respondents who engaged in this survey have shared their
perspective and plans across a wide selection of cybersecurity areas, along with a
deeper dive into topics associated with the specific areas of applications, cloud
platforms and services, identities, and data.

The priorities presented in this white paper may not, however, immediately
resonate for your organization. Investment priorities for any given organization
must be set within the context of their current posture, real-world threat data, and
known areas of concern (and unknown areas of weakness). This is the fundamental
work that cybersecurity decision-makers and influencers must coordinate within
their own organizations. Do that work, assess what is needed, and use this white
paper as an external reference point to ensure the right issues are being addressed.
