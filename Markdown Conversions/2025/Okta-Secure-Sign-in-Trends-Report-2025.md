# The Secure Sign-in Trends
# Report 2025

An inside look at MFA adoption and the authenticators that
influence it

09 DECEMBER 2025

The enterprise security landscape is characterized by two contrasting
trends, according to Okta’s annual study of billions of anonymized
authentications. Organizations are maintaining the steady adoption of
traditional defenses while rapidly shifting toward advanced security
standards.

The analysis reveals that while overall multi-factor authentication (MFA)
adoption within the workforce context (employees accessing apps and
tools) has reached 70%, organizations are also making a critical shift: The
adoption of phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication has grown by
63%, rising from 8.6% to 14.0% in one year.

The findings also show that these phishing-resistant methods are
demonstrably faster and more user-friendly than less secure
authenticators, upending the idea that security comes at the expense of
user experience.

## Key findings include:

*   Overall, workforce MFA adoption continues its upward trajectory,
    reaching 70%, but nearly a third of users still lack MFA.
*   The adoption rate of phishing-resistant authenticators increased 63%
    in one year, with Okta FastPass adoption nearly doubling.
*   Phishing-resistant authenticators offer superior security and better
    user experience than traditional authenticators.
*   The technology sector leads MFA adoption (87%), while retail saw the
    biggest growth (up 9 percentage points).
*   The Asia Pacific region saw the strongest year-over-year growth, with
    its MFA adoption rate increasing 7 percentage points (from 61% to
    68%).

(Note: All data and conclusions in the report are based on analysis of
anonymized Okta Workforce Identity data and workforce use cases unless
otherwise noted. See the methodology at the end of this article for more
information.)

## User MFA adoption continues to climb

The data reflects monthly user-level MFA adoption rates exclusively for Okta Workforce
Identity customers, who use the platform to secure access for their employees, contractors,
and partners. Data from Okta Customer Identity, customer-facing use cases, and regulated
environments is excluded.

Overall, MFA adoption reached 70% of users as of January 2025, reflecting
a mostly steady annual increase since 2020. This upward trend in adoption
suggests organizations are increasingly recognizing the need for additional
authentication security.

## AMER leads in MFA adoption rate, APAC posts the
highest growth

MFA user adoption rates in North, Central, and South America (AMER); Asia-Pacific (APAC);
Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).

We observed consistent rates of MFA adoption growth over the last three
years across the three regions studied: North, Central, and South America
(AMER); Asia-Pacific (APAC); Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).

APAC saw the strongest year-over-year growth: Its adoption rate increased
7 percentage points (from 61% to 68%), compared to the 2 percentage-
point increase in AMER and EMEA. This growth was driven by significant
improvements in MFA adoption in Hong Kong (62% to 81%), South Korea
(63% to 80%), and Japan (53% to 62%).

This regional growth likely reflects a stronger regulatory focus and rising
security awareness across the APAC region, where governments and
enterprises are accelerating digital transformation initiatives that
emphasize identity protection and modern authentication.

## Tech tops MFA user adoption rates, retail posts the
highest MFA growth

MFA user adoption rates across industries, listed in descending order by rate.

MFA adoption rates are relatively consistent across industries, with the
majority falling within the 60% to 80% adoption range. Outliers include
transportation and warehousing (42%) and retail (52%) at the low end of
adoption and technology at the high end (87%).

The industries with the largest rate of MFA growth year over year included:

*   Retail: from 43% to 52%
*   Arts, entertainment, and recreation: from 63% to 68%
*   Healthcare and pharmaceuticals: from 70% to 74%

The retail sector experienced the largest growth of all industries, rising 9
percentage points year over year. It was also one of three industries
targeted by cybercriminal group Scattered Spider (a.k.a. Scatter Swine,
Muddled Libra) in early 2025. We expect further MFA adoption by the retail
sector in the wake of these events.

## Smaller organizations show higher adoption rates

MFA user adoption rates across organizations of different sizes, by number of employees.

When we view MFA adoption by organization size, we continue to observe
an inverse correlation between the number of employees and the rate of
MFA adoption: The larger the organization, the lower the adoption rate.

That said, we observed higher MFA adoption rates since 2024 in
organizations with 1,250 to 3,999 employees (from 74% to 77%) and 4,000
to 1,9999 employees (from 67% to 71%). This growth suggests that the
tide might be turning, especially as large organizations increasingly adopt
centralized identity management platforms.

## Passwords reign, but phishing-resistant authenticators
gain ground

User adoption rates for authenticators available with Okta Workforce Identity. The sum of the
adoption rates for each authenticator is higher than the overall MFA adoption rate, given that
users may use multiple authenticators.

While passwords continue to have the highest adoption rate by a wide
margin, we see more secure forms of authentication making promising
gains.

When we look at phishing-resistant authenticators (FastPass, WebAuthn,
and Smart Card) combined, we see a 63% increase in the adoption rate,
which rose from 8.6% to 14.0% of users in one year.

This growth indicates that companies are actively replacing vulnerable,
traditional security methods, such as SMS and passwords, with higher
assurance authenticators. The adoption of phishing-resistant
authenticators coincides with a decline in reliance on weaker factors.

Adoption of FastPass — which uses public key cryptography to offer a
secure, passwordless sign-in experience — almost doubled, rising
from 6.7% to 13.3%.

Usage of low-assurance SMS fell from 17.5% to 15.3%, and overall
password usage decreased from 95.1% to 93.0% of users.

MFA user adoption rates for FastPass, WebAuthn, and Smart Card combined. This overall
rate counts a user only once, even if they use multiple phishing-resistant authenticators. It is
lower than the sum of individual authenticator adoption rates, where a user utilizing multiple
authenticators (such as WebAuthn and FastPass) is counted separately for each.

## Security versus user experience is a false choice

Authenticator usability, security, and adoption for password, email, hardware token, push,
security question, SMS, soft token, voice, FastPass, and WebAuthn authenticators as of
January 2025. The size of the bubble reflects the authenticator’s adoption rate on a scale of
0% to 100%.

"Security introduces friction" is no longer a foregone conclusion. Analysis of
authentication data contradicts this outdated industry assumption by
showing that phishing-resistant methods can be more secure and more
user-friendly.

To assess the usability and security of each authentication method, we
developed scoring rubrics for each. For the usability score, we evaluated
backend identity provider metrics, including challenge time, enrollment
time, and challenge failure rate. For the security score, we evaluated
challenge failure rate, challenge brute-force failure rate, phishing-resistant
coverage, and phishing-resistant alert coverage.

We then polled 81 external IT and security practitioners on the relative
importance of each metric and weighted the metric based on their
responses to arrive at the overall scores. Each authenticator's performance
is represented by its usability and security scores shown in the matrix.

We did not assess metrics requiring data external to the identity flow, such
as the lead time to purchase the authenticator, qualitative user experience,
or data detailing authenticator use during verified malicious credential
attacks and account takeovers.

As the matrix demonstrates, phishing-resistant methods WebAuthn and
FastPass deliver a superior user experience and have the highest security
scores. While lower assurance authenticators, such as password, email,
security question, and soft token, score poorly for both security and
usability.

Authenticators such as FIDO2 WebAuthn and FastPass perform well by
combining multiple factors simultaneously. They provide high assurance by
verifying something you have (a possession factor, like a registered device)
with something you are (an inherence factor, like a biometric scan). Those
who use these methods gain security assurance while enjoying a sign-in
process that is demonstrably faster and simpler than traditional, more
vulnerable methods.

Users are starting to take note, with some ditching the password
altogether. Our study found that in January 2025, 7% of users did not use a
password for any sign-ins, validating that enterprise-scale password
elimination is achievable today. While the number may seem small, it
demonstrates exciting potential: Passwordless for enterprises is possible
now.

## Policy, proof, and the new security baseline

Our findings confirm that the industry has passed the point of treating MFA
as an optional enhancement. It is critical for businesses to stay secure.
Given the success rate of social engineering and phishing campaigns, the
accelerated adoption of phishing-resistant authentication methods is a
necessary market response.

The old argument that robust security must come at the expense of user
productivity is not supported by the data. The security landscape is no
longer about compromise, but transformation. Major technology
companies, including Salesforce, GitHub, AWS, and Microsoft, are
signaling this shift by committing to mandatory MFA enforcement for their
privileged users, indicating that MFA is transitioning from a recommended
best practice to a mandatory security baseline.

Policy can be a powerful driver of change. For example, Okta's mandatory
MFA policy for administrator console access in 2024 resulted in 100%
adoption among customer admins by August 2025.

Phishing-resistant authentication is secure, user-friendly, and demonstrably
achievable. It is critical for protecting organizations against today's threats
while reducing user friction.

## 5 tips to improve your authentication strategy

To successfully navigate this security transformation, leaders must
transition from discussing best practices to mandating new standards.
Organizations should focus on these requirements:

*   **Prioritize phishing resistance**: Mandate phishing-resistant MFA for all
    sensitive access, while eliminating low-assurance methods (like SMS) from
    all sign-on policies.
*   **Elevate MFA as a risk metric**: Treat the adoption of MFA, particularly
    phishing-resistant MFA, as a C-suite and board-level risk metric, enabling
    visibility and accountability for organizational security posture.
*   **Adopt a Zero Trust framework**: Shift access control to a per-session, least-
    privilege basis, dynamically evaluating the user, the device's posture, and
    the network context at the moment of access and throughout the session.
*   **Secure the full user lifecycle**: Apply phishing-resistant authentication
    methods to user enrollment and account recovery flows to prevent
    attackers from using these entry points for account takeover.
*   **Plan for password minimization**: Develop a clear, long-term strategic plan
    to phase out the reliance on passwords as a primary factor across the
    enterprise.

## Methodology: About the data

The study is based on data from Okta Workforce Identity as of January
2025, with the exception of the MFA user adoption rate over time, which
extends from October 2019 to January 2025.

The data was anonymized and aggregated from billions of monthly
authentications and verifications originating from countries worldwide. The
report methodology has been updated this year to reflect only commercial
customer environments, excluding data from regulated environments. The
charts and stats in this report, including data from prior years, reflect the
new methodology.

Customers and their employees, contractors, partners, and clients use the
Okta Platform to securely log in to devices, websites, applications, and
services, leveraging security features to protect their data. These
organizations span every major industry and vary in size, from small
businesses to some of the world’s largest enterprises.

Company size is defined by the number of full-time employees in the
company. Company industry taxonomy aligns with the North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS). Company size, industry, and
geographic region were all validated using third-party resources.

All user adoption rate metrics are determined by the percentage of users
who signed in using the studied authenticators over a one-month period.

Unless otherwise noted, this analysis focuses exclusively on Okta
Workforce Identity data and workforce use cases. It does not include Okta
Customer Identity data.
