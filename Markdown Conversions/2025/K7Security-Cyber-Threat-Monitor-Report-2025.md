# PHISHING’S EVOLVING DISGUISE: HUMAN-CENTRIC ATTACKS

K7 Cyber Threat Monitor

Phishing attacks are not new. It has been there since the cyber world was unleashed; just that it has become more and more sophisticated with a growing cyber population. Targeted socially engineered attacks have increased over the years in cyberspace.

Though cyber awareness campaigns have been on the rounds to help cyber users identify and learn from phishing attacks, humans still continue to be the most vulnerable in identifying whether it is a phishing threat or not.

So why are human-centric attacks still on the rise? This is primarily due to human emotions.
For instance, employees still continue to urgently reply to emails if they come from a sender with whom they are emotionally connected with. In this case, it has to do with respect. Obeying a seniors’ orders is a matter of showing respect to their position and authority. So humans will think twice to check the authenticity of the email when it appears to come from a known sender.

To minimise this, organizations should start focusing on remediation, not just once their network has malware in it, but to restrict this payload from intruding into their organizations’ network through socially engineered channels; by applying rules to restrict such threats from reaching the users’ and also through increased cyber awareness.

We at K7 Labs offer significant protection from emerging and latest threats by closely examining and identifying such incidents and providing security at multiple layers.

Kindly read and share the report with your colleagues. Have a safe digital experience!
Enjoy reading!

# INFECTION RATE (IR)

K7 Cyber Threat Monitor

Regardless of its type, a security breach is something to be concerned about in every aspect of our digital lives.

And that’s precisely what our infection rate indices indicate.

Those new to our quarterly report need to understand an important concept called “Infection Rate” (IR), which serves as the basis for benchmarking cybersecurity risk for enterprises and netizens.

We use this IR factor to identify enterprises and netizens’ exposure to cyber threats. IR is determined as the proportion of active K7 corporate or consumer users who encountered at least one cyber threat event that was blocked and reported to our K7 Ecosystem Threat Intelligence infrastructure (K7ETI). The higher the IR, the greater the risk.

Active users indicate users who have activated and updated their products.

The concept of Infection Rate is better explained by the below picturization.

# VULNERABILITIES AND INDUSTRY IMPACT

K7 Cyber Threat Monitor

The era of isolated attacks is over; we are firmly in a persistent cyber conflict driven by state-sponsored actors and highly professionalized cybercrime cartels. Our data, showing IT/ITES (28%) and Manufacturing (21%) as the most-hit sectors, is not a coincidence; it’s a direct reflection of an adversary strategy focused on high-value intellectual property and supply chain choke points.

![Vulnerability Impact grouped by Industry](Image description)

For the C-suite and founders, this means two things: First, vulnerability debt is business debt. The continued exploitation of old flaws like MS17-010 (76%) highlights a critical failure in patching hygiene. Second, initial access vectors are becoming sophisticated. Current headlines, such as the major Jaguar Land Rover disruption in October 2025 and the surge of the Qilin ransomware group targeting critical Fortinet vulnerabilities, confirm that supply chain attacks and the exploitation of edge devices are now the main entry points. Furthermore, the DaVita healthcare attack in August 2025, compromising over 2.6 million patient records, proves that the Healthcare (12%) and Government (12%) sectors are consistently under siege.

The lower proportional figures for Banking (2%) and Finance (4%) shouldn’t breed complacency; instead, they signal these sectors face fewer, but far more sophisticated, low-volume, high-impact intrusions that bypass signature-based defenses.

# INDUSTRIES UNDER SIEGE: A SECTOR-BY-SECTOR THREAT PROFILE

K7 Cyber Threat Monitor

The Infection Rate (IR) data of significant industries serves as a stark warning, translating generalized threats into specific operational risks for CXOs and founders. The top-tier IR for Government (23%) and Hospitality (20%) confirms these sectors are high-velocity targets, prized for sensitive public data and high-volume transaction records, respectively. This signifies persistent threat actor activity and often reflects a critical lack of immediate patch deployment or robust segmentation.

![Most Impacted Industries around the Globe](Image description)

The elevated rates for Food and Beverage (19%), Manufacturing (18%), IT/ITES (17%), and Consultants (17%) highlight the pervasive threat environment across the economic engine. For these C-Level leaders, the risk is about supply chain contamination and intellectual property theft. An IR of 17% in a consulting firm, for instance, implies direct exposure of client-sensitive data. Even the seemingly modest 15% for Banking is alarming, suggesting high-volume, albeit potentially lower-impact, commodity malware is frequently finding footholds, often through employee endpoints. The lowest rates in Textiles (8%) and Retail (8%) may indicate a proportionally smaller volume of attacks, but not necessarily less severity.

# ENTERPRISE INSECURITY

K7 Cyber Threat Monitor

Case Study: Purplefox installed using exposed SMB shares

SMB shares are used by enterprises to access their data on a remote system as if they were on local devices.

However, this traffic can be exploited by threat actors to deploy malware.

In one of our enterprises’ networks, Purplefox malware was attempted to be installed using SMB.

The kill-chain is as detailed below:

*   Threat actors discover SMB shares exposed to the internet, beaconed by multiple Keygens and KMSAuto being used by customers
*   Threat actors then bruteforce themselves into the enterprise’s network
*   Network settings are change for installing the RDPWrap application for better remote access
*   Firewall is turned off, and threat actors reassign the server’s port numbers
*   The PAExcel tool is then used to remotely create a service, which in turn downloads the Purplefox malware

# CYBER THREATS EXECUTIVE BRIEFING: Q2 2025-26

K7 Cyber Threat Monitor

## 1. Executive Summary

*   Global Risk Variance: Certain regions face a higher threat level than others. Countries like Pakistan (33% infection rate) and Japan (30%) are disproportionately affected compared to the UK (10%) and the US (18%). This disparity directly impacts global operations and third-party risk management.

This briefing outlines key findings from the Q2 2025-26 Cyber Threat Report. Cyberattacks are evolving into persistent threats, driven by advanced state-sponsored groups and professional cybercriminals. The growing issue of “vulnerability debt,” unaddressed software weaknesses, poses a significant risk to operations and financial stability across the global threat landscape. Adversaries are exploiting these flaws to target intellectual property and disrupt supply chains. Immediate action is required to strengthen our defenses and reduce these risks.

## 2. Background

The current threat landscape features coordinated attacks targeting specific industries, exploiting both legacy and new vulnerabilities to maximize impact. High-profile incidents like the Jaguar Land Rover supply chain attack and the DaVita healthcare breach demonstrate that no sector is immune. This briefing translates broad threat data into actionable risks for our organization, enabling informed decision-making.

## 3. Key Findings

*   Targeted Attacks by Industry: Industries such as IT/ITES (28%) and Manufacturing (21%) are primary targets due to their critical roles in the supply chain and valuable intellectual property. Healthcare and Government also face consistent attacks. Even Finance (4%), with lower attack volumes, experiences sophisticated intrusions designed to evade standard defenses.
*   Exploitation of Old Vulnerabilities: Widespread use of outdated vulnerabilities, such as MS17-010 (76% of related incidents), highlights systemic issues in patch management. This “vulnerability debt” is the most significant risk for network breaches and ransomware attacks.
*   Platform-Specific Threats:
    *   Windows: Remains the most targeted platform for enterprise attacks, focusing on credential theft and lateral movement.
    *   Android & macOS: Increasingly targeted with sophisticated Trojans (86% of Android threats, 88% of macOS threats) aimed at stealing credentials and compromising corporate data.

## 4. Business Implications

The findings present clear risks to our business:

*   Operational Disruption: Attacks on supply chains or Manufacturing can lead to production downtime, revenue loss, and reputational damage.
*   Financial and Legal Exposure: Ignoring “vulnerability debt” increases the risk of costly ransomware incidents, regulatory fines, and lawsuits.
*   Loss of Competitive Advantage: The theft of intellectual property, such as proprietary designs or strategies, can harm our market position.

## 5. Recommendations

To address these risks, we recommend the following actions:

*   **Prioritize Vulnerability Management**: Implement a rigorous, time-bound patch management program. Treat critical patches with the same urgency as financial system outages to eliminate legacy “vulnerability debt.”
*   **Strengthen Access Controls**: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, especially for remote access and privileged accounts, to prevent credential theft.
*   **Invest in Advanced Detection**: Deploy security solutions that focus on behavioral analysis rather than traditional signature-based tools to improve detection of modern, fileless attacks.
*   **Reassess Third-Party Risk**: Evaluate the security posture of key partners and suppliers, particularly in high-risk regions, to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities.

## 6. Conclusion

The evolving cyber threat landscape presents a strategic challenge that demands executive attention. By prioritizing cybersecurity as a core business function and implementing the recommendations above, we can safeguard our assets, enhance resilience, and protect our competitive edge.
