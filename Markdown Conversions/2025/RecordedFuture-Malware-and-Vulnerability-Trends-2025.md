H1 2025 Malware and Vulnerability Trends

Vulnerabilities in Microsoft products and edge security appliances were the most exploited in H1 2025, with state-sponsored actors driving over half of observed exploitation campaigns.

RATs such as XWorm and Remcos overtook infostealers as primary tools for persistent access and data theft compared to H1 2024, while ransomware groups adopted new affiliate models and evasion tactics.

Android banking trojans adopted overlays and NFC relay attacks for real-world fraud, while Magecart operators expanded beyond Magento to WooCommerce and used modular e-skimmers to evade detection.

## Executive Summary

The first half of 2025 (_H1 2025_) reflected a rapidly evolving threat landscape defined by the convergence of persistent legacy threats and advanced new tactics.

The total disclosed CVEs[^1] increased by 16% from H1 2024, and threat actors exploited 161 vulnerabilities with assigned CVEs, with nearly half linked to malware or ransomware campaigns. Microsoft remained the most targeted vendor, while edge security and gateway devices continued to be high-value targets for initial access. Malware activity was similarly dynamic: while law enforcement takedowns disrupted major players like LummaC2, a resurgence of legacy malware such as Sality indicated that old tools still offer utility for modern actors. Remote access trojans (_RATs_) like AsyncRAT, XWorm, and Remcos also gained prominence, marking a tactical shift away from the previous dominance of dedicated information stealers (infostealers) in H1 2024 toward more versatile tools that combine data theft capabilities with persistent, hands-on access.

Mobile malware threats continued to grow in H1 2025, with Android banking trojans adopting virtualization-based overlays and near-field communication (_NFC_) relay attacks to bypass user defenses and enable real-world financial fraud. These innovations reflect a growing trend in financial fraud toward mobile-first exploitation targeting both app and payment ecosystems. Ransomware groups, meanwhile, leaned further into affiliate-driven models, offering ready-made payloads and infrastructure to lower barriers for new entrants. Some ransomware families introduced stealth features such as protected payloads or novel loaders designed to evade endpoint detection. Meanwhile, Magecart skimming campaigns adopted multi-stage, modular infection chains and innovative obfuscation techniques to evade content security policies and inject malicious scripts only during critical moments like checkout.

Taken together, H1 2025 underscores that the threat landscape is not only expanding but fragmenting, with threat actors exploiting both novel and legacy tools across diverse attack surfaces. To respond effectively, organizations should prioritize patching of internet-facing systems, particularly gateway and edge security products, which are frequently targeted for initial access. Detection capabilities must extend beyond endpoint telemetry to include behavioral monitoring, command-and-control (_C2_) traffic analysis, and script obfuscation detection in web environments. Investment in threat intelligence is essential for staying ahead of rapidly changing tactics, such as malware repackaging. Organizations should also revisit mobile device policies and strengthen application vetting and user awareness to counter increasingly sophisticated mobile malware campaigns.

[^1]: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

## Key Findings

- CVE disclosures increased 16% compared to H1 2024, with 161 of those vulnerabilities actively exploited in H1 2025. Of those, 42% had a public proof-of-concept (_PoC_) exploit, nearly 69% required no authentication, and 30% enabled remote code execution (_RCE_), underscoring attackersʼ preference for low-friction, high-impact exploits. Microsoft and edge-gateway appliances each made up 17% of exploits, and more than half of the attributed exploitations were state-sponsored, highlighting state-sponsored threat actorsʼ high capabilities to weaponize flaws quickly.
- Based on Recorded Future Triage submissions and Insikt Group reporting, Command and Control (`TA0011`) was the most frequently observed malware tactic, with over 194,000 detections. Top techniques (according to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix) included data encrypted for impact (`T1486`), valid accounts (`T1078`), and data from local systems (`T1005`), emphasizing the prevalence of ransomware deployment and the importance of persistent access to obtain and exploit sensitive data.
- The mobile threat landscape continued to evolve during the first half of 2025, marked by the discovery of eleven new mobile malware strains and the resurgence or continued operation of nine others. This included banking trojans, infostealers, spyware, and RATs. Long-standing tactics, techniques, and procedures (_TTPs_) like overlay attacks remained common, though with some innovation.
- Threats to contactless payments increased, as evidenced by the discovery of SuperCard X, a Chinese MaaS platform that enables NFC relay fraud by capturing and transmitting contactless card data to attacker-controlled devices.
- Ransomware threat actors adopted new TTPs across the attack chain during the first half of 2025. This included ClickFix-based social engineering for initial access, endpoint detection and response (_EDR_) evasion via bring-your-own-installer (_BYOI_) techniques, and custom payloads using just-in-time (_JIT_) hooking and memory injection to bypass detection. Ransomware threat actors also continued to use legitimate tools for persistence, data theft, and stealthy C2, including AnyDesk to maintain access, Syteca for keylogging, and GC2 for cloud-based C2.

## Vulnerability Exploitation Trends

### Key Takeaways

- 23,667 CVEs were published in H1 2025, a 16% increase compared to H1 2024. Attackers actively exploited 161 vulnerabilities, and 42% of those exploited flaws had public PoC exploits. 21 out of the 27 Nuclei templates published by Insikt Group corresponded to vulnerabilities that appear in the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (_CISA_) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (_KEV_) catalog.
- Microsoft products accounted for 17% of such exploitations, but attackers also concentrated on edge-security and gateway appliances such as SSL-VPNs and next-gen firewalls (similarly 17%), whose position at the network perimeter makes them attractive entry points for attacks that can later propagate through downstream supply chains.
- 69% of exploited vulnerabilities did not require authentication, and nearly one-third enabled RCE. 151 exploited vulnerabilities were used to deploy malware and 73 to launch ransomware, with backdoors the most common payload. State-sponsored actors drove more than half of the attributed exploitation, highlighting the significant strategic drivers of such attacks, as well as such actorsʼ capabilities to weaponize flaws shortly after disclosure.

### Microsoft Leads Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities as Total Disclosed Vulnerabilities Rise Compared to 2024

In the first half of 2025, the volume of disclosed vulnerabilities continued to climb. The total number of CVEs increased by 16% compared to H1 2024, rising from 20,385 in H1 2024 to 23,667 in H1 2025. This growth suggests an expanding attack surface and more opportunities for threat actors to find exploitable flaws. Notably, the most common vulnerability types by weakness were web application issues: Cross-Site Scripting (`CWE-79`) and SQL Injection (`CWE-89`) represented the highest share of weaknesses, followed by Cross-Site Request Forgery (`CWE-352`), generic Injection flaws (`CWE-74`), and Missing Authorization (`CWE-862`). This highlights that fundamental security gaps in web applications remain widespread, and organizations should heed these trends; the persistence of injection and scripting weaknesses means attackers will continue to find easy targets in poorly secured web interfaces.

When looking at actively exploited vulnerabilities in H1 2025, Microsoft products dominated the field. Microsoft accounted for the highest number of actively exploited CVEs with 28 (see Figure 1), of which twenty targeted Windows specifically. This tally was more than triple that of the next most targeted vendors: Apple (eight), Ivanti (seven), and Linux (six). The outsized targeting of Microsoft likely reflects the ubiquity of Windows across enterprises; attackers naturally prioritize vulnerabilities in widely deployed systems to maximize potential victims. In total, Insikt Group identified exploited vulnerabilities affecting 81 distinct vendors. This breadth indicates that exploitation in the wild is not concentrated on just a few big-name software suites; instead, attackers are casting a wide net.

Attackers continue to opportunistically probe less common software and environments, likely perceiving that organizations may delay patches or have limited monitoring on those systems, making them softer targets. For defenders, this means a robust patch management program cannot ignore the long tail of software assets: a vulnerability in a lesser-known product can still be the entry point for a major breach if left unpatched.

Another notable trend is the focus on vulnerabilities in the tools designed to keep networks safe. 17% of the actively exploited CVEs affected edge-security and gateway products. This included SSL-VPNs, next-gen firewalls, secure gateways, and remote access portals from vendors such as Ivanti, SonicWall, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, Citrix, Juniper, and Sophos, as well as virtualization underlays like VMware.

Because these appliances terminate VPNs, decrypt traffic, and broker trust between networks, a single exploit instantly grants attackers a privileged, authenticated pathway into an organizationʼs environment for initial access and lateral movement. For instance, `CVE-2025-0282` (Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure) allowed remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the appliance and steal credentials for further lateral movement inside the network. This trend underscores that threat actors — including well-resourced state-sponsored groups — are increasingly targeting these security infrastructure platforms to operate with minimal detection. Organizations must harden and promptly patch their network edge devices and monitor them closely, as these systems have become high-value targets that attackers use to bypass traditional defenses and pivot deep into corporate networks.

Attackers were observed exploiting 161 distinct vulnerabilities in the first half of 2025, according to Recorded Future data. This exceeds the 136 vulnerabilities listed in CISAʼs KEV catalog for the same timeframe. In other words, Recorded Future telemetry identified 25 additional exploited CVEs beyond what was publicly recognized by CISA during that period.

Of those 161 exploited flaws, 68 (42%) had a publicly available PoC exploit (see Figure 2). The availability of a PoC lowers the bar for exploitation, effectively allowing a larger pool of attackers (including less-skilled threat actors) to weaponize the vulnerability. In multiple cases, Insikt Group has observed exploitation activity surge within days or hours of a PoC release. Organizations should therefore implement rapid patching or interim mitigations to limit the window of exposure.

In terms of access requirements and impact, Figure 3 shows that 111 (69%) of the 161 vulnerabilities required no authentication to exploit, and 78 (48%) could be exploited remotely over a network (as opposed to requiring local access or user interaction). In other words, this heavy tilt toward unauthenticated, remote exploits means that attacks can be launched directly from the internet against vulnerable hosts, with no credentials or insider access needed.

48 (30%) of the exploited CVEs enabled RCE, which often grants an attacker full control over the target system, while another 11 (7%) enabled privilege escalation, which is typically used to gain higher system access. None of the exploited vulnerabilities facilitated lateral movement (exploits that facilitate jumping from one system to another). Given that so many exploited flaws are both remotely exploitable and require no valid user account, organizations must proactively scan and prioritize patching for internet-facing applications and services.

### UNC5221 Focuses on Ivanti Products as Cobalt Strike Is Most Frequently Associated with Post-Exploitation Activity

The threat actors exploiting these vulnerabilities range from sophisticated state-sponsored groups to profit-driven cybercriminals, and the data from H1 2025 highlights the significant role of state-sponsored campaigns. In cases where Insikt Group could determine attribution, nearly 53% of the observed exploitation activity was driven by state-sponsored and suspected state-sponsored actors. This illustrates that more than half of the attributed exploitations were strategic in nature and conducted for espionage, surveillance, or other geopolitical objectives.

Financially motivated groups (those involved in, for example, theft and fraud and not necessarily linked to ransomware) accounted for 27% of exploitations. Another 20% of exploitation was attributed to ransomware and extortion groups, reinforcing how common it has become for ransomware operators to leverage exploits as an initial access vector to then conduct file-encrypting attacks at scale.

This breakdown highlights that both strategic and criminal motivations are driving vulnerability exploitation, with a notable absence of any known hacktivist campaigns; hacktivist collectives are typically motivated by disruption and likely lack the intent and capability to conduct such exploitations.

By contrast, the presence of state-sponsored actors at the top underlines that many governmentsʼ cyber units have the resources to weaponize new flaws quickly, often within days of a disclosure. The significant state-sponsored involvement also implies that these threats are not just random or opportunistic but often targeted and persistent campaigns aiming at specific sectors or high-value systems.

Geographically, the majority of state-sponsored campaigns were conducted by Chinese state-sponsored actors or suspected China-linked actors. Such groups are known to exploit edge infrastructure and enterprise solutions to establish footholds in target networks, and Insikt Groupʼs observations in the first half of 2025 reaffirm that. The suspected China-linked group UNC5221 exploited the highest number of vulnerabilities and demonstrated a preference for Ivanti products, targeting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (_EPMM_; `CVE-2025-4428`) and Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure (`CVE-2025-22457` and `CVE-2025-0282`).

![Vulnerabilities by triggered risk rule, based on Recorded Future data (Source: Recorded Future)](image-placeholder-4.png)

Of the 161 exploited vulnerabilities, Recorded Future data shows that 151 were leveraged in some form of malware deployment (see Figure 4). Within those, 73 vulnerabilities were specifically tied to ransomware deployments — they were either the initial access point for a ransomware attack or used at some stage in the ransomware kill chain. In practical terms, unpatched vulnerabilities are a common entry point for attackers to introduce malware into a victimʼs environment; whether the ultimate payload is a remote access trojan (_RAT_) or ransomware, the initial step of exploiting a weakness is the same.

Insikt Group found that the most commonly observed malware used post-compromise was the offensive security tool Cobalt Strike. Tools such as Cobalt Strike are ideal for gaining a reliable foothold for attackers as they provide a full-featured toolkit to run commands, escalate privileges, and move laterally, while blending in with normal network traffic. After Cobalt Strike, the Vshell RAT was the malware most frequently observed alongside exploitation.

Overall, as shown in Figure 5, backdoor malware accounted for nearly 23% of all post-exploitation activity. The frequent appearance of backdoors and various trojans means that a single exploit often leads to multi-payload efficiency for attackers: with one vulnerability, they may deploy a backdoor, which then allows them to stage additional tools or eventually deliver ransomware, all from that same initial entry point and without needing to develop custom malware.

For defenders, this trend is a reminder to monitor for known post-exploitation tools and behaviors. The presence of Cobalt Strike beacons, for example, should be treated as an immediate high-priority incident, while an unusual use of legitimate admin tools or new services could indicate that a RAT or backdoor is running.

![Actively exploited vulnerabilities by malware category (Source: Recorded Future)](image-placeholder-5.png)

From a tactics and techniques perspective, the patterns of exploitation in the first half of 2025 align with known adversary behaviors in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The most frequent ATT&CK technique was Exploit Public-Facing Application (`T1190`), observed in 73% of actively exploited vulnerabilities. This was followed by Exploitation for Client Execution (`T1203`) and Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (`T1068`). These three techniques demonstrate a clear picture of attacker preferences and playbooks. `T1190` indicates that attackers are heavily targeting servers and services exposed to the internet (for example, web servers or VPN gateways), which is a direct route into a network.

The prevalence of `T1203` shows that attackers are also investing in exploits that require user interaction (for example, a malicious email attachment or drive-by download that triggers an exploit on the victimʼs end). In these scenarios, the vulnerability may be in a client-side application such as a browser or office document software, and the attacker socially engineers the victim into running the exploit. `T1068` underscores that once attackers get a foothold, they often elevate their privileges (for example, going from a normal user to SYSTEM or root). This pattern shows how attackers frequently leverage initial access, execution, and privilege escalation into a single exploit chain, and illustrates how an attacker can go from having no access to domain admin privileges if the right combination of unpatched flaws exists.

Internet-facing systems and unpatched client software will remain prime targets, and failing to patch those creates an avenue for attackers to get in and escalate their privileges. Defenders should ensure both their perimeter systems and endpoint applications are up to date, and have monitoring in place for exploit attempts.

### Insikt Group Detection Rules Maintain Alignment with Known Exploited Vulnerabilities

In the first half of 2025, Insikt Groupʼs own detection efforts kept pace with the evolving threat landscape by continuously creating new Nuclei templates (automated vulnerability detection signatures). Insikt Group created 27 new Nuclei templates designed to identify vulnerable systems, focusing on the most dangerous flaws. 21 out of the 27 templates corresponded to vulnerabilities that appear in CISAʼs KEV catalog. In other words, the majority of Insikt Groupʼs detection rules were directly aligned to vulnerabilities that were known to be actively exploited in the wild.

The vendors that showed up most frequently in Insikt Groupʼs Nuclei templates were Fortinet, Apache, and Ivanti, which is consistent with the threat trends observed. By developing Nuclei templates for these vendorsʼ vulnerabilities, Insikt Group helped equip organizations to rapidly scan their infrastructure and find any unpatched instances before attackers do.

Notably, Insikt Group published 13 unique Nuclei templates that do not have an existing public template available from Project Discovery (see Figure 7). In those cases, Insikt Group authored and shared the detection logic for vulnerabilities that were not yet covered by the open-source community for Nuclei signatures, filling critical detection gaps for Recorded Future customers.

![Overlap of Insikt Group Nuclei templates with CISA KEV and Project Discovery (Source: Recorded Future, CISA, Project Discovery)](image-placeholder-7.png)

Additionally, Figure 8 shows the time between Insikt Groupʼs publication of a Nuclei template and the targeted vulnerabilityʼs addition to CISAʼs KEV catalog (the below chart only lists CVEs that both had a template and were added to KEV). Five vulnerabilities that were added to KEV in H1 2025 — `CVE-2025-32433` (Erlang SSH), `CVE-2025-24813` (Apache Tomcat), `CVE-2024-41713` and `CVE-2024-55550` (Mitel MiCollab), and `CVE-2024-56145` (Craft CMS) — had an existing Insikt Group Nuclei template available. This means organizations leveraging Insikt Groupʼs detections could scan for those issues as soon as (or even before) they were formally recognized as actively exploited by
