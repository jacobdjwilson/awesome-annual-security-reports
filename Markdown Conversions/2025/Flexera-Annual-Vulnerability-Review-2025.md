# Introduction

Welcome to our Monthly Vulnerability Insights by Flexera. This comprehensive, monthly review is based upon data from the Secunia Research team at Flexera who produces valuable advisories leveraged by users of Flexera’s Software Vulnerability Research and Software Vulnerability Manager solutions.

The Secunia Research team is comprised of several security specialists who methodically test, verify and validate disclosed vulnerabilities from hundreds of sources. Since the founding of the Secunia Research team in 2002, it has been our goal to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

## Secunia Research software vulnerability tracking process.

A vulnerability is an error in software which can be exploited with a security impact and gain. Secunia Research validates, verifies and tests vulnerability information to author security advisories which provide valuable details by following consistent and standard processes which have been refined over the years.

Whenever a new vulnerability is reported, it’s verified and a Secunia Advisory is published. A Secunia Advisory provides details, including description of the vulnerability, risk rating, impact, attack vector, recommended mitigation, credits, references and more, including additional details discovered during verification and testing, thus providing the information required to make appropriate decisions about how to protect systems. Click here to learn more about Secunia Advisories and their contents.

## The anatomy of a Security Advisory

A security advisory is a summary of the work that Secunia Research performs to communicate standardized, validated and enriched vulnerability research on a specific software product version.

We issue Secunia Research criticality ratings and common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) metrics after a distinct analysis in the advisories. This dual rating method allows for a much-improved means of prioritizing by criticality—delivering a review that includes product context and security best practices.

A rejection advisory issued by the research team issues means we’ve determined it’s not worthy of your attention. This advisory comes if a vendor issues an advisory acknowledging vulnerability that we don’t believe to be valid—and would have a product solution we aren’t recommending or exceeding already. We send that out to save you considerable time.

If someone other than the vendor issues an advisory and we don’t believe to be valid, we discard it. We take that action, so you don’t waste your time processing inconsequential vulnerability information.

# Notable Vulnerability – and Threat Intelligence news:

November 2025 told a different story beneath the surface. From surging vulnerability disclosures to state-level breaches and ransomware attacks, the month revealed a cybersecurity landscape marked by speed, stealth, and severity. From an Advisory view:

*   SA147563 & SA147563| Microsoft Edge & Google Chrome |
    Zero Day: Yes |Extreme Critical | CVSS: 8.8 | Threat Score: 96
    Type Confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 142.0.7444.175 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)

    These threats have been associated with the following exploits:
    *   Tsundere (Botnet)
    *   Clop Ransomware (Ransomware)
    *   BadIIS
    *   EVEREST Ransomware (Ransomware)

    CVE-2025-13223 ⚫Actively being exploited!

# NVD Update

After nearly two years of unrelenting growth, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) backlog has finally shown a modest but noteworthy decline. This downward trend, while not dramatic, suggests a potential turning point in how disclosed software vulnerabilities are managed. However, this development calls for closer examination, especially regarding its causes and implications for organizations depending on accurate and timely vulnerability intelligence.

The improvement is not primarily due to an increase in analysis from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Instead, it appears to be the result of a significant reduction in new CVEs published by CVE.org and subsequently ingested by NVD. This distinction is important. The dip in numbers may reflect a slowdown in reporting or publishing activity rather than a fundamental solution to the underlying backlog.

Currently, more than 26,000 CVEs remain unanalyzed by the NVD. This leaves a substantial gap in vulnerability coverage and puts organizations at risk if they rely solely on NVD-based data. Many third-party solutions draw from the same incomplete source, which means they also miss critical information. As a result, security teams may lack the full picture required to assess and respond to threats in a timely and effective manner.

For organizations with compliance obligations or operating in high-risk sectors, this data gap poses a serious problem. Security teams must be able to trust the intelligence that informs their vulnerability management and patching strategies.

## Why Independent Vulnerability Research Matters

This is where independent research becomes essential. Flexera’s Secunia Research provides an alternative approach, one that goes beyond public data sources. It delivers verified, timely, and actionable intelligence backed by expert analysis. Rather than relying solely on automation, Secunia Research adds human verification, context around exploitability, and insights into product-specific risks.

Organizations need more than raw data. They need clarity on which vulnerabilities are relevant, which are exploitable, and which should be prioritized. This can only be achieved through high-quality, continuously updated intelligence that helps reduce the time between disclosure and remediation.

With the increasing pressure from regulations such as the NIS2 Directive in Europe or Australia’s Essential Eight, the need for reliable and complete vulnerability intelligence is greater than ever. These frameworks require proactive and auditable approaches to cyber risk, something that cannot be delivered through partial or delayed CVE data.

Secunia Research helps close this gap, giving security and IT operations the insight they need to act quickly and confidently. For those serious about reducing risk and maintaining compliance, relying on trusted and complete intelligence is not optional. It is essential.

# Risk Scoring Model:

There are many ways to prioritize Software Vulnerabilities , a previous article I wrote on LinkedIn : Key Elements of a Balanced Risk Scoring Model I shared some key components that can build a balanced risk scoring model. There is no standard in prioritizing vulnerability remediation , but the goal is to spark some discussion about what’s important, and for obvious reasons , I’ve used the Secunia Research Data to perform the calculation.

My current model is based on 7 variables that have been normalized to a score between 0 and 1 based on custom scaling or just using the score as is (CVSS)

*   Attack Vector
*   Secunia Criticality Score
*   Impact / Consequence
*   CVSS Score
*   Patch Availability
*   Threat Intelligence
*   Zero Day

With that the Risk Score will be between 0 – 7 (0 = rejected)

## Top Advisories released this month based on the calculated
Risk Score:

| Risk Score Thresholds | Attack Vector     | Secunia Criticality | Impact Severity              |
| :-------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------- |

↑ increased ↓lower ↔ same

\* 188 advisories have received the “rejected” status which means in general that leveraging it would require one or more violations of security best practices (e.g., product not securely configured or not used securely) or that it was “too weak of a gain” (e.g., administrative, local users already being too privileged so that additional gain becomes neglectable). More information about rejections can be found in the rejection section.

# Rejected advisories.

There are many vulnerabilities posted to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) by a lot of people and companies. They are not always valid, assigned a proper criticality, and in some cases, a vulnerability may be legitimate but not afford the attacker any benefit.

The Secunia Research team at Flexera evaluates vulnerabilities from hundreds of sources, rescores them when necessary and even rejects vulnerabilities not worth your attention. Rejection Advisories help you to reduce the volume of vulnerabilities to be mitigated by helping you focus only on those that present a reasonable risk to your environment.

An advisory may be rejected many reasons. The most common are:

*   **No reachability**: The vulnerability cannot be exploited because the affected systems cannot be reached by an attacker.
*   **No gain**: The vulnerability may be reached, but without any gain for the attacker.
*   **No exploitability**: The vulnerability cannot be exploited because, for example, policy forbids installation of the affected software.
*   **Dependent on other**: The vulnerability cannot be exploited by itself but depends on another vulnerability being present.

# Addressing awareness with vulnerability insights

## Prevalence:

*   How many systems would benefit from any given security update?
*   Does it pose a risk? It’s on all systems? Patch.

## Asset Sensitivity:

*   What systems would result in the most risk if compromised?
*   Is it a high-risk device? Patch.

## Criticality:

*   The most popular method of thoughtful prioritization.
*   If exploited, how bad could it affect your security? Is it designated to be of a high criticality? Patch.

## Threat Intelligence:

*   The newest and most impactful method focuses on the likelihood of exploitation.
*   Is it likely to be exploited? Patch.

### How do we know that more insights/data is needed?

Focusing on vulnerabilities with CVSS 7 or higher would address about 50 percent of exploits. Most exploits are CVSS scored between 4 and 7. Focusing on vulnerabilities for the top 20 vendors would address only about 20 percent.

**Take away 1:**
Critical vulnerabilities do not necessarily present the most risk. Leverage threat intelligence to better prioritize what demands your most urgent attention. Organizations who do not have Threat Intelligence data should consider implementing this to ensure they have the complete picture.

**Take away 2:**
Most vulnerabilities have a patch available (typically within 24 hours after disclosure).
*   **No fix**: no patch available for this insecure version, therefore need to upgrade
*   **Likely (Possibly) fixed**: related to a rejection advisory

# Threat intelligence

In a world where there are more than 40,000 new vulnerabilities every year, being smart about prioritizing remediation efforts is essential. Leveraging Threat Intelligence, another valuable layer of insight is provided to help you understand which of the vulnerabilities affecting your environment are actually being exploited in the wild.

Leveraging machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human curation from thousands of sources in the open, deep and dark web, Threat Intelligence augments Software Vulnerability Research’s vulnerability intelligence with a Threat Score that provides the ultimate prioritization tool for your busy desktop operations teams.

## Threat intelligence data:

| Type of Threat affecting Advisories | # SAIDS | Last month |
| :---------------------------------- | :------ | :--------- |
| Penetration Testing Tools           | 659 ↑   | 655        |

# Patching

Most of this month’s vulnerabilities are vendor patched. In fact, most vulnerabilities are patched within 24 hours after disclosure.

The challenge remains that organizations do not have full visibility or awareness when a vulnerability is disclosed (time to awareness).

For the benefit of the cybersecurity community and network defenders—and to help every organization better manage vulnerabilities and keep pace with threat activity—CISA maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild: the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog. CISA strongly recommends all organizations review and monitor the KEV catalog and prioritize remediation of the listed vulnerabilities to reduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.
