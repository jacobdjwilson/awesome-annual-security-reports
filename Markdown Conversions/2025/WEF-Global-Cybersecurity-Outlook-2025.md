## Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025

### Foreword

Jeremy Jurgens
Managing Director,
World Economic Forum

Paolo Dal Cin
Global Security Lead,
Accenture

Following decades of relative stability, the world
today is marked by increased geopolitical conflicts.
The fallout of this turbulence in the digital realm –
the growing prowess of cybercriminals, rapid
advances in emerging technologies and widening
cyber capabilities – have led to a cyberspace that
is more complex than ever before. Against this
backdrop, the Global Cybersecurity Outlook serves
as an indispensable tool to help leaders navigate
such complexity and identify essential actions to
build resilient ecosystems.

Last year’s report brought to the fore the prevailing
inequity between the cyber haves and have-
nots. Despite increased executive awareness of
cybersecurity risks, the complexity in cyberspace
is further exacerbating cyber inequity as resilient
organizations pull ahead, while others struggle
with limited resources. Amid increasingly
interdependent supply chains, this cyber inequity
is resulting in systemic points of failure with
significant consequences for the overall resilience
of the ecosystem.

The transformative potential of AI technologies
presents both unprecedented risks and unmatched
opportunities for cybersecurity. As organizations
race to adopt AI, cybercriminals are moving at
breakneck speed to exploit vulnerabilities while
enhancing the efficacy of their methods. Cyber
defenders, too, are leaving no stone unturned in
harnessing the potential of these technologies to
shift the balance in this growing AI arms race.

Looking to the future, the level of complexity shows
no signs of abating. In a borderless cyberspace,
greater collaboration between actors in the public
and private sectors is crucial for safeguarding
the benefits of digitalization for all. This is a call to
action, and the time to act is now.

### Executive summary

In a complex cyberspace characterized by
geopolitical uncertainties, widening cyber
inequity and sophisticated cyberthreats,
leaders must adopt a security-first mindset.

While the 2024 edition of the Global Cybersecurity
Outlook highlighted the growing inequity in
cyberspace, this year’s report shines a light on
the increasing complexity of the cyber landscape,
which has profound and far-reaching implications
for organizations and nations.

This complexity is driven by a series of
compounding factors:

*   The rapid adoption of emerging technologies
    is contributing to new vulnerabilities as
    cybercriminals harness them effectively to
    achieve greater sophistication and scale.
*   Simultaneously, the proliferation of regulatory
    requirements around the world is adding a
    significant compliance burden for organizations.
*   Escalating geopolitical tensions are contributing
    to a more uncertain environment.

All of these challenges are exacerbated by a
widening skills gap, making it extremely challenging
to manage cyber risks effectively.

*   Increased integration of and dependence on
    more complex supply chains is leading to a
    more opaque and unpredictable risk landscape.

**Figure A**: Factors compounding the complex nature of cybersecurity

The growing complexity of cyberspace is
exacerbating cyber inequity, widening the gap
between large and small organizations, deepening
the divide between developed and emerging
economies, and expanding sectoral disparities.¹

Some 35% of small organizations believe their
cyber resilience is inadequate, a proportion that
has increased sevenfold since 2022. By contrast,
the share of large organizations reporting insufficient
cyber resilience has nearly halved.

![Image description]
**Figure B**: Organizations reporting insufficient cyber resilience
Smaller organizations are struggling to ensure cyber
resilience, while larger organizations show steady progress

71% of cyber leaders at
the Annual Meeting on
Cybersecurity 2024 believe
that small organizations have
already reached a critical
tipping point where they can
no longer adequately secure
themselves against the growing
complexity of cyber risks

This disparity in cyber resilience is further
highlighted by regional differences in preparedness:
while only 15% of respondents in Europe and North
America lack confidence in their country’s ability to
respond to major cyber incidents targeting critical
infrastructure, this proportion rises to 36% in Africa
and 42% in Latin America.

The public sector is disproportionately affected, with
38% of respondents reporting insufficient resilience,
compared to just 10% of medium-to-large private-
sector organizations. This inequity extends to
the cyber workforce, with 49% of public-sector
organizations indicating they lack the necessary
talent to meet their cybersecurity goals – an
increase of 33% from 2024.

The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025 report includes
a deeper analysis of the most important drivers of
complexity and provides valuable insights into the
most pressing cyber challenges in the year ahead
and their potential implications for executives.

These are the key findings from this year’s report and the main
trends that executives will need to navigate in 2025:

### Supply chain vulnerabilities are emerging
as the top ecosystem cyber risk

Of large organizations, 54% identified supply chain
challenges as the biggest barrier to achieving cyber
resilience. The increasing complexity of supply
chains, coupled with a lack of visibility and oversight
into the security levels of suppliers, has emerged as
the leading cybersecurity risk for organizations.
Key concerns include software vulnerabilities
introduced by third parties and propagation of
cyberattacks throughout the ecosystem.

### Geopolitical tensions shape cybersecurity strategy

Nearly 60% of organizations state that geopolitical
tensions have affected their cybersecurity
strategy. Geopolitical turmoil has also affected the
perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing
cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/
intellectual property (IP) theft as their top concern,
while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about
disruption of operations and business processes.

### Rapid adoption of AI introduces new vulnerabilities

While 66% of organizations expect AI to have the
most significant impact on cybersecurity in the year
to come, only 37% report having processes in place
to assess the security of AI tools before deployment.

This reveals the paradox of the gap between the
recognition of AI-driven cybersecurity risks and the
rapid implementation of AI without the necessary
security safeguards to ensure cyber resilience.

In your view, which of the following will most significantly
affect cybersecurity in the next 12 months?
Does your organization have a
process in place to assess the
security of AI tools before
deploying them?

Yes
No

Generative AI is augmenting cybercriminal capabilities,
contributing to an uptick in social engineering attacks

Some 72% of respondents report an increase
in organizational cyber risks, with ransomware
remaining a top concern. Nearly 47% of
organizations cite adversarial advances powered
by generative AI (GenAI) as their primary concern,
enabling more sophisticated and scalable attacks.
In 2024 there was a sharp increase in phishing
and social engineering attacks, with 42% of
organizations reporting such incidents.

### Regulations bolster cyber resilience, yet their fragmentation
introduces significant compliance challenges

Regulations are increasingly seen as an important
factor for improving baseline cybersecurity posture
and building trust. However, their proliferation and
disharmony are creating significant challenges
for organizations, with more than 76% of chief
information security officers (CISOs) at the
World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting on
Cybersecurity in 2024 reporting that fragmentation
of regulations across jurisdictions greatly affects
their organizations’ ability to maintain compliance.

### Organizations are grappling with a shortage of critical cyber talent

Since 2024, the cyber skills gap has increased
by 8%, with two out of three organizations
reporting moderate-to-critical skills gaps, including
a lack of essential talent and skills to meet their
security requirements. Furthermore, only 14%
of organizations are confident that they have the
people and skills they need today.

# 1 Understanding
complexity in
cyberspace

As cyberspace becomes increasingly
complex, it has the potential to exacerbate
cyber inequity for organizations that are
unable to meet growing challenges.

8

Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025

---

Cybersecurity is entering an era of unprecedented
complexity. Geopolitical tensions are intensifying,
new technologies are emerging at breakneck
speed and threats are evolving into ever more
sophisticated attack vectors. At the same time,
expanding regulatory demands, vulnerabilities
in interwoven supply chains and a widening
cyber skills gap are compounding the challenges
organizations face in staying secure. The stakes
have never been higher.

## 1.1 Major disparities and disruptions

72%
of GCO survey
respondents reported
a rise in cyber risks.

The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2024 revealed
significant cyber inequity, exposing stark disparities
in resilience between small and large organizations.²
The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report
2024 found that cyber insecurity is a global risk
over multiple time horizons, with cyber risks
such as malware, deepfakes and misinformation
threatening supply chains, financial stability and
democratic systems.³ Additionally, the Chief Risk
Officers Outlook from October 2024 ranked cyber
risk among the top three threats severely affecting
organizations.⁴ A striking 71% of chief risk officers
anticipated severe organizational disruptions due to
cyber risks and criminal activity.⁵

In 2024 the world witnessed the largest IT outage
in history, disrupting airlines, banks, broadcasters,
healthcare providers, retail payment systems and
ATMs globally and causing an estimated $5 billion in
losses.⁶ This incident underscored the vulnerabilities
stemming from dependence on a limited number
of critical providers. Cyberthreats continued to
escalate, with 72% of respondents to the Global
Cybersecurity Outlook (GCO) survey (see Appendix:
Methodology) reporting a rise in cyber risks. The
survey further revealed that cybercrime grew in
both frequency and sophistication, marked by
ransomware attacks, AI-enhanced tactics – such
as phishing, vishing and deepfakes – and a notable
increase in supply chain attacks.

## 1.2 The challenge for the year ahead

The 2025 report finds that a series of compounding
factors are driving an escalating complexity in the
cyber landscape:

*   Geopolitical tensions are contributing to a
    more uncertain environment.
*   Increased integration and dependence on more
    complex supply chains are leading to a more
    opaque and unpredictable risk landscape.
*   The rapid adoption of emerging technologies
    is contributing to new vulnerabilities and
    new threats.

Meanwhile, the proliferation of international
regulatory requirements adds an additional
compliance burden for organizations. All of these
challenges are compounded by a widening skills
gap, further complicating the ability to manage
cyber risks effectively.

Together, these factors drive increasing complexity
and unpredictability in the cyber landscape,
which affects organizations in many ways. First,
it drives inequity throughout the cyber ecosystem,
undermining resilience by creating a divide between
those organizations that have the resources to
adapt and those that do not and subsequently
fall behind. This affects the resilience of the
ecosystem, because many larger and more
mature organizations typically depend on extensive
networks of smaller, often less-mature suppliers,
and any incident affecting them could also impact
the entire supply chain. Second, it drives greater
demand for more specialist skills in cybersecurity,
further exacerbating the skills gap. Keeping up
with technological advances requires more specific
skills that are in greater demand in the cyber
skills market. At the same time, complexity puts
increasing pressure on often already stretched
cybersecurity teams.

These challenges demand a comprehensive re-
evaluation of cyber strategies at the organizational
and ecosystem level to address the complexity that
has become inherent in the cyber landscape.⁷ A
broader understanding of cyber risk is necessary
that goes beyond mere “IT” and considers cyber
from an overall business risk perspective.

**Figure 1**: Factors compounding the complex nature of cybersecurity

"Against a backdrop of growing cyberthreats and expanding attack surfaces,
network defenders are drowning in the operational complexity of a legacy
security mindset. They struggle to stitch together dozens of disparate security
solutions and enforce security policies across an enterprise’s network, cloud
and endpoint environments. As a result, people – our most precious cyber
resource – are left manually triaging alerts from increasingly automated attacks.
To stay ahead of adversaries, we need to reimagine cybersecurity operations,
leverage the power of AI and deprive attackers of any technological advantage."

Nikesh Arora, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks

As cybercriminals embrace advanced tools,
the evolving threat landscape demands
innovative strategies to combat increasingly
sophisticated and far-reaching attacks.

## 2.1 The cyberthreat landscape

### The evolution of cybercrime

Ransomware remains the top organizational
cyber risk year on year, with 45% of respondents
ranking it as a top concern in this year’s survey.
According to leaders at the Annual Meeting on
Cybersecurity 2024, significant innovations in
ransomware attacks should be expected. This
is compounded by the continued adoption of
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), entrenching
the commoditization of the ransomware model.⁸

Cyber-enabled fraud ranks as the second-highest
organizational cyber risk for 2025, viewed by
CEOs as a significant threat alongside ransomware
and supply chain disruptions. At the same time,
identity theft climbs to the top of the agenda,
emerging as the primary personal cyber risk for
both CISOs and CEOs.

"The rapid advancements and increasing adoption of digital
platforms globally is matched by an equally evolving cyberthreat
landscape. Cybercrime today is increasing not just in scale but also in
sophistication. As our digital footprints widen, so does the potential
attack surface for nefarious actors. It is essential that we work together
to address this growing menace. The borderless nature of the internet
necessitates collaboration across various jurisdictional limitations to
ensure that threat actors have no safe haven for their evil activities."

Ivan John E. Uy, Secretary of Information and Communications
Technology of the Philippines

Cyberattackers are adopting new tools to increase
the effectiveness and scope of familiar forms of
attack, such as ransomware and business email
compromise (BEC). GenAI tools are lowering
the cost of the phishing and social engineering
campaigns that give attackers access to
organizations. Therefore, while the core character
of cyberattacks has remained stable, organizations
may need to place additional emphasis on
protecting themselves against well-developed
phishing and cyber-fraud campaigns.

Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) platforms
continue to be a dominant and rapidly growing
business model in the criminal landscape, allowing
individuals or groups without technical expertise to
engage in illicit online activities by purchasing the
necessary tools and support.⁹ This model, which
is already well established among criminal groups,
has progressively been adopted in other areas of
cybercrime, such as AI-enhanced phishing attacks.
These platforms present a challenge, as they remove
the barriers for entry into cybercriminal activities.
While progress has been made in dismantling
some of the platforms, enforcement efforts remain
inconsistent as CaaS platforms continue to thrive.

### The convergence of cybercrime and organized crime groups

The surge in the volume and value of cyber-enabled
fraud has attracted “traditionally” violent organized
crime groups into the cybercrime market. The
interaction of organized cybercrime with organized
violent crime groups is changing the nature of
cybercrime and greatly increasing their social impact.

This is perhaps most starkly shown by the trafficking
of more than 220,000 people to forcibly work in online
scam-farms in South-East Asia.¹⁰ With such farms
engaging in the harvesting of data, disinformation and
social engineering to name a few capabilities, they are
essentially becoming “criminal service providers”.¹¹
According to the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, scammers
have siphoned away more than $1 trillion globally in
the past year, costing certain countries losses of more
than 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP).¹²

The entry of traditional organized crime groups
into the cybercrime arena changes the character
of the criminal market. Organized crime groups
are accustomed to causing physical harm and are
arguably less concerned about the risk created by
attacking critical social services such as medical
services.¹³ When this cultural change is paired with
the scale provided by CaaS platforms, the range
of organizations that could be targeted by attacks
such as ransomware becomes wider.¹⁴

"Cybercrime has persistently evolved alongside the threat landscape,
and its reach extends beyond financial loss, becoming a disruptive force
that threatens our societies. We must remain vigilant and collaborate
across sectors to safeguard the future of our digital world. Cybercrime’s
impact is far-reaching – it can halt operations, undermine confidence
and permeate to our operational technology and critical infrastructure.
In the year ahead, we must prioritize not only defence but proactive and
systemic disruption of these criminal networks as part of our collective
effort to ensure cyber resilience and protect our digital future."

Ken Xie, Founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Fortinet

### AI as a catalyst of cybercrime

GenAI tools are reshaping the cybercrime
landscape by enabling criminals to refine their
methods, and automate and personalize their
techniques. With 47% of organizations citing their
top concern surrounding GenAI as the advance
of adversarial capabilities, cybercriminals are
harnessing the efficiency of AI to automate and
personalize deceptive communications. Some
42% of organizations experienced a successful
social engineering attack in the past year, a number
that can only increase with advances and the
malicious adoption of AI.

![Image description]
**Figure 6**: Cybersecurity issues linked to GenAI
Which cybersecurity issues related to GenAI concern you the most?

"Cybercriminals are using GenAI to convincingly
replicate the communication styles of an
organization’s senior leaders. These tools harness
contextual data from sources such as social
media, public statements or leaked documents,
making social engineering attempts much more
sophisticated and challenging to identify. GenAI also
supports attackers in developing credible social
engineering attacks in a wider range of languages,
which helps threat actors target a greater number
of people in more countries at a lower cost."

When augmented with GenAI, threat actors can
create convincing impersonations of the voice, video,
images and writing styles of senior leaders. When
these deepfakes are maintained over prolonged
interactions with targeted staff, they can be used to
defraud organizations or help attackers gain access
to their IT systems. Accenture’s research has noted
a 223% rise in the trade of deepfake-related tools on
dark web forums between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024.¹⁵

Additionally, 55% of CISOs polled during the
Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity 2024 stated
that deepfakes pose a moderate-to-significant
cyberthreat to their organization. With staff
remaining the real target of deepfake attacks,
as well as phishing campaigns in general,
organizations will need to rethink how they train and
protect everyone, from employees to the C-suite
and board, about new patterns of cybercrime.

"As global leaders, we see cyber challenges as more than just a threat – they’re
a chance to make a real difference in how we protect people and businesses.
Malicious cyber activity takes a significant toll on the most vulnerable populations,
so we must urgently drive ecosystem-level solutions that bring everyone together,
from small local companies to big global corporations. By collaborating like never
before, we can turn the tables in 2025, make systemic change and create digital
defences that work for everyone."

Philip Reiner, Chief Executive Officer and Founder,
Institute for Security and Technology

Finally, GenAI lowers the barriers to entry into the
cybercrime arena in terms of cost and required
expertise. GenAI is expected to streamline the
process from the exploitation of vulnerabilities to the
deployment of malware, scaling up operations that
were previously reliant solely on human capabilities.

By understanding the complexity of the cyberthreat
landscape as well as the behaviour and motivations
of cybercriminals, organizations can better assess
the risks facing them and then tailor and prioritize
security strategies to enhance resilience against
such threats.

"The complexity of today’s cyber threats and evolving criminal methodologies
requires a unified response. This response requires coordination not only from the
global law enforcement community, but with cybersecurity experts who provide
their own talents, experiences and expertise. In 2024, INTERPOL’s Cybercrime
Directorate supported several regional and global cybercrime operations that
were very successful in large part due to these collaborations. As we move into
2025, our team will continue to pursue new partnerships and strengthen existing
ones to have even greater impact disrupting cybercriminal activity."

Neal Jetton, Director, Cybercrime Directorate, International
Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL)

### CASE STUDY 1
Old scams and new technology – Arup

Arup hit the headlines for the wrong reasons when
the firm was targeted by criminals who succeeded
in pulling off a major fraud. “Fraudsters use
deepfake technology to trick employee into paying
millions” ran one headline, but the story is more
subtle than that.

It was a sophisticated, preplanned attack that
used tactics such as phishing, vishing and
smishing, all backed by fake documentation and
a false sense of urgency. At its heart, though,
this was an old-fashioned payment scam with a
modern makeover.

Clearly, media attention was driven by the fact
that the fraudsters used manipulated videos
and voicemails to convince people they were
talking to genuine colleagues. But as Arup’s
Chief Information Officer, Rob Greig, pointed
out, the interesting part is that the criminals
did not penetrate the firm’s IT networks or
disrupt business operations. Rather, they used
“technology enhanced social engineering” to
convince people to process transactions.

Since the incident, the firm has reviewed every
aspect of its systems and processes. Among the
key lessons learned is that cybersecurity alone
is not enough. Building real resilience requires a
culture of critical assessment and the ability to
spot red flags across the organization.

The most important lesson, though, is that
industry, the police and public authorities all
need to find better ways to share information and
frustrate the fraudsters.

### Beyond cybercrime: Emerging threats to
critical infrastructure and human safety

With emerging technologies reshaping the landscape, cyber is no longer
limited to the CIA triad: confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.
Cybersecurity now encompasses human safety and needs to address the
real risk to people’s lives when a system is attacked or compromised.

Bushra AlBlooshi, Director of Cybersecurity Governance Risk Management
Department, Dubai Electronic Security Centre

Escalating geopolitical tensions and increasingly
sophisticated cyberthreats pose significant risks to
critical infrastructure, which depends on networks
of interconnected devices and legacy systems.
The ongoing conflict in Ukraine exemplifies these
vulnerabilities, with critical sectors such as energy,
telecommunications, water and heating repeatedly
targeted by both cyber and physical attacks.¹⁶
These attacks often focus on disrupting control
systems and compromising data, highlighting the
critical risks associated with operational technology
(OT). As cyberthreats continue to evolve, they
not only threaten system functionality but also
jeopardize human safety, increasing the severity and
consequences of disruptions to vital infrastructure.
Some critical, high-risk areas to monitor are:

#### Water facilities

Cyberattacks on water facilities pose significant
risks to public safety, infrastructure and national
security. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) of the United States
outlined these risks in a toolkit, emphasizing the
vulnerabilities in OT systems used in water facilities,
such as remote access points and outdated
software.¹⁷ Cybercriminals can exploit these
weaknesses to disrupt water-treatment processes,
causing potential contamination, loss of service or
other hazardous consequences. A notable example
of these threats occurred in October 2024, when a
cyberattack targeted the largest water utility in the
United States, disrupting operations and raising
alarms about the security of critical infrastructure.¹⁸

#### Biosecurity

Rapid technological advances have redefined the
biological threat landscape, with biosecurity coming
to the forefront. The World Health Organization
(WHO) has warned that advances in artificial intelligence,
cyberattacks and genetic engineering could pose
potentially catastrophic risks to global biosecurity.¹⁹
A 2024 WHO report highlighted several ways in
which cyberthreats could compromise biosecurity,
including accessing sensitive data or research,
disruption of laboratory security systems, theft or
sabotage of biosecurity-relevant information and
espionage for competitive or harmful objectives.²⁰
Furthermore, cyberattacks could incapacitate
essential laboratory systems, interrupting operations
and causing loss of data integrity, which would
delay critical research or compromise safety
protocols. Over the course of 2024, two laboratories
were targeted in South Africa and the United
Kingdom.²¹ These vulnerabilities underscore the
need for advanced cybersecurity measures in
biosecurity strategies to address these growing risks.

Simultaneously, the sensitive nature of genomic data
poses new risks due to its unique qualities, such as
the ability to identify individuals and reveal their familial
ties.²² These characteristics expose genomic data
to threats such as reidentification from seemingly
anonymous datasets, unauthorized access leading to
privacy violations and potential misuse. The breach
of a genetic-testing company in late 2023 that exposed
the data of nearly 7 million people has already trained
the spotlight on these risks.

"As genomics continues to evolve as a critical field, securing sensitive
biological data, the interconnected systems and the users becomes
essential. The protection of bioinformatics platforms, along with the
prevention of misuse in biotechnical applications, is vital. This includes
safeguarding data analytics and securing the broader ecosystem
of interconnected systems to mitigate risks across sectors. As
these emerging technologies grow, the need for robust security in
bioinformatics, their analytics and cyber-physical systems will only
increase, creating new resiliency challenges for cybersecurity leaders."

Hoda Al Khazimi, Director, Centre for Cybersecurity,
New York University Abu Dhabi

#### Communications infrastructure

From large-scale state-sponsored cyber
espionage via telecommunications infrastructure
to the targeting of satellites and undersea cables,
geopolitical tensions continue to manifest through
the increasing number of attacks on critical
communications infrastructure.²³

Following the 2022 attack on ViaSat’s satellite
network that highlighting the consequences of a
cyberattack on military communication and civilian
life in Europe, there were 124 further recorded
cyber operations against the space sector in
the context of the conflict in Ukraine.²⁴ With the
increased reliance on space technologies, it is a
prime target for espionage, operational disruption
and weaponization.

Undersea cables are crucial for global data flow and
economic exchange. Their strategic role makes them
vulnerable to monitoring and disruption, especially
with limited defence measures and rising geopolitical
tensions. Incidents in the Baltic Sea since the start
of the conflict in Ukraine highlight the urgent need
to protect these critical pieces of infrastructure.²⁵

#### Climate and energy

As the global climate crisis intensifies, its
implications for cybersecurity are becoming
increasingly significant. Modern technology relies
heavily on substantial energy consumption,
rendering power grids highly attractive targets for
cybercriminals. Simultaneously, energy systems
are undergoing a profound transformation as
societies transition to renewable technologies. It is
essential that these emerging energy systems are
designed with security as a foundational priority;
otherwise, in the effort to address an existential
crisis with urgency, there is a risk of introducing
vulnerabilities that could undermine the reliability
of this new energy infrastructure, with far-reaching
consequences for the economy and society.

## 2.2 Security in the Intelligent Age

"The security of AI systems (or lack thereof) can have far-reaching
implications given the increasing adoption of AI. My belief is that AI
should be developed and deployed in a safe, secure and trustworthy
manner for the public good. Advancing this will need an inclusive,
multilateral and multistakeholder approach. Digital technology like
AI is borderless and global. We must cooperate and work together
to secure AI, even in the face of ongoing geopolitical tensions and
strategic competition in critical and emerging technologies."

David Koh, Commissioner of Cybersecurity and Chief Executive,
Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA)

“The Intelligent Age – driven by rapid advancements
in AI, quantum computing and blockchain – is
transforming everything and changing it right now,
in real time.” The advent of the Intelligent Age brings
unprecedented opportunities and unprecedented
risks; the importance of security in safeguarding
the promise of these transformative technologies
cannot be overstated. ²⁶

### The AI–cyber paradox

Emerging technologies present significant
opportunities for organizations to enhance efficiency
and optimize operations. As a result, many
organizations are actively developing strategies to
integrate these technologies into their infrastructure.
However, the cyber risks associated with the
underlying technologies or their implementation in
organizations often do not receive the attention and
consideration they require.

While AI is not a new phenomenon, the advent
of GenAI has accelerated the adoption of AI in
organizations around the globe. Organizations
are testing or adopting AI technologies to drive
efficiencies and gain a competitive advantage.
However, they do not always design strategies and
processes for secure implementation. When adopting
new technologies, it is critical for organizations to
assess the cyber risks they entail and implement
the related cybersecurity controls to ensure
operational and wider business cyber resilience.

According to the GCO survey, 66% of organizations
anticipate that AI will have the most significant
impact on cybersecurity in the coming year.
However, only 37% of respondents report having
a process in place to assess the security of AI
tools prior to deployment. This creates a risk that
organizations may implement or adopt AI systems –
whether developed internally or sourced from
third-party providers – without fully considering
the associated cybersecurity risks and associated
mitigation measures, while potentially introducing
vulnerabilities into their IT estate.

Does your organization have a process
in place to assess the security of AI
tools before deploying them?

Yes
No

This issue is particularly alarming for smaller
organizations, of which 69% lack adequate
safeguards for the secure deployment of AI
technologies. These could include, for example,
ensuring all new assets (devices and software)
relating to AI infrastructure are inventoried, ensuring
the security of training data and monitoring the
behaviour of AI systems to detect manipulation
in a timely manner.²⁷ This contributes to the
widening of cyber inequity as it leaves less-
resourced entities more exposed to the risks of
insecure AI models. It also increases the collective
vulnerability of the ecosystem in which these
smaller organizations operate.

A holistic approach is necessary for the secure
adoption of AI: 74% of global CEOs surveyed
by KPMG agree that building a strong cyber
culture is central to integrating AI safely into
their organization.²⁸

"The LLMs currently in use are constitutively insecure, and the adversarial attacks
and supply chain sabotage that are possible are not being addressed in a sufficiently
meaningful way. Integrating these models into critical infrastructure before such
attack vectors are remedied is dangerous and needs to be reevaluated."
