Global Risks Report 2025

## Preface

Saadia Zahidi
Managing Director

The multi-decade structural forces highlighted in
last year’s Global Risks Report – technological
acceleration, geostrategic shifts, climate change
and demographic bifurcation – and the interactions
they have with each other have continued their
march onwards. The ensuing risks are becoming
more complex and urgent, and accentuating a
paradigm shift in the world order characterized by
greater instability, polarizing narratives, eroding trust
and insecurity. Moreover, this is occurring against a
background where today’s governance frameworks
seem ill-equipped for addressing both known and
emergent global risks or countering the fragility that
those risks generate.

This is the 20th edition of the Global Risks
Report. Looking back over the last two decades,
environmental risks have steadily consolidated their
position as the greatest source of long-term concern.
This year’s Global Risks Perception Survey shows
that a sense of alarm is also mounting in the shorter
term: Environmental problems, from extreme weather
to pollution, are here now and the need to implement
solutions is urgent.

Concerns about state-based armed conflict and
geoeconomic confrontation have on average
remained relatively high in the ranks over the last 20
years, with some variability. Today, geopolitical risk
– and specifically the perception that conflicts could
worsen or spread – tops the list of immediate-term
concerns. Fear and uncertainty cloud the outlook in
various parts of the world, including in Ukraine, the
Middle East, and Sudan, with multilateral institutions
struggling to provide effective mediation and work
towards resolutions.

Societal risks such as inequality rank high among
today’s leading concerns as well as over the
last years. Polarization within societies is further
hardening views and affecting policy-making. It also
continues to fan the flames of misinformation and
disinformation, which, for the second year running,
is the top-ranked short- to medium-term concern
across all risk categories. Efforts to combat this risk
are coming up against a formidable opponent in
Generative AI-created false or misleading content
that can be produced and distributed at scale.
More broadly, technological risks, while not seen as
immediate, rise in the rankings for the 10-year time
horizon, given the rapid pace of change in areas
such as AI and biotech.

Economic risks have fallen in the rankings since
last year, with inflation and the risk of an economic
downturn no longer top of mind among decision-
makers and experts. But there is no room for
complacency: if the coming months see a spiral of
tariffs and other trade-restricting measures globally,
the economic consequences could be significant.
Elevated valuations in several asset classes make
them more vulnerable to these and other risks.

In this report we dive deep into key global risk
themes – conflict, trade wars, and technology
and polarization as leading short- to medium-term
concerns, as well as pollution, biotech and super-
ageing as areas where serious risks could unfold
over a longer-term time horizon. We also provide
a retrospective view of the last two decades of
assessing global risks. Twenty years ago, when
we were preparing our first Global Risks Report,
the world was in a different place. Risks that have
been well managed and mitigated since then were
those where the concerted and collective efforts of
multistakeholder leaders helped to build common
ground, compromises and mutually acceptable
solutions. It will be up to visionary leaders to involve
all key stakeholders to address the risks now
foreseen for the next decade and to build durable
peace and prosperity.

The report highlights the latest findings from our
annual Global Risks Perception Survey, which this
year brought together the collective intelligence of
over 900 global leaders across academia, business,
government, international organizations and civil
society. It also leverages insights from some 100
thematic experts, including the risk specialists who
form the Global Risks Report Advisory Board, the
Global Future Council on Complex Risks, and the
Chief Risk Officers Community. We would also
like to express our gratitude to the core team that
developed this report – Mark Elsner and Grace
Atkinson – and to Ricky Li, Ignacio Moreno and
Gayle Markovitz for their support.

The world has changed profoundly over the last 20
years and will continue to do so in unpredictable
ways. But foresight based on informed, expert views
remains critical for better planning and preparation,
in both the short and long term. The 20th Global
Risks Report continues to shine a light on globally
relevant risks that are often complex and sometimes
alarming. Yet, in examining the trajectory of the risks
foreseen over the last two decades, it is clear that
there is no viable alternative to multilateral solutions
going forward. Leaders across the public and private
sectors, civil society, international organizations and
academia must seize the baton to work openly and
constructively with each other. By deepening honest
dialogue and acting urgently to mitigate the risks
that lie ahead, we can rebuild trust and together create
stronger, more resilient economies and societies.

Global Risks Report 2025

## Overview of methodology

The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS)
has underpinned the Global Risks Report for two
decades and is the World Economic Forum’s
premier source of original global risks data. This
year’s GRPS has brought together leading insights
on the evolving global risks landscape from over 900
experts across academia, business, government,
international organizations and civil society.
Responses for the GRPS 2024-2025 were collected
between 2 September and 18 October 2024.

“Global risk” is defined as the possibility of the
occurrence of an event or condition that, if it occurs,
would negatively impact a significant proportion
of global GDP, population or natural resources.
Relevant definitions for each of the 33 global risks
are included in Appendix A: Definitions and
Global Risks List.

The GRPS 2024-2025 included the following
components:

- Risk landscape invited respondents to assess
the likely impact (severity) of global risks over
one-, two- and 10-year horizons to illustrate the
potential development of individual global risks
over time and identify areas of key concern.

- Consequences asked respondents to consider
the range of potential impacts of a global risk
arising, to highlight relationships between risks
and the potential for compounding crises.

- Risk governance invited respondents to reflect
on which approaches have the most potential
for driving action on global risk reduction and
preparedness.

- Outlook asked respondents to predict the

evolution of key aspects underpinning the global
risks landscape.

Appendix B: Global Risks Perception
Survey 2024-2025 provides more detail on the
methodology.

To complement GRPS data on global risks, the
report also draws on the World Economic Forum’s
Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) to identify
risks that pose the most severe threat to each
country over the next two years, as identified by
over 11,000 business leaders in 121 economies.
When considered in context with the GRPS, this
data provides insight into local concerns and
priorities and points to potential “hot spots” and
regional manifestations of global risks. Appendix
C: Executive Opinion Survey: National Risk
Perceptions provides more detail.

Finally, the report integrates the views of leading
experts to generate foresight and to support
analysis of the survey data. Contributions were
collected from 59 colleagues across the World
Economic Forum’s platforms. The report also
harnesses qualitative insights from 96 experts
from across academia, business, government,
international organizations and civil society
through community meetings, private interviews
and thematic workshops conducted from April
to November 2024. Experts included members
of the Global Risks Report Advisory Board, the
Global Future Council on Complex Risks and
the Chief Risk Officers Community. Refer to
Acknowledgements for more detail.

Global Risks Report 2025

## Key findings

The Global Risks Report 2025 presents the findings
of the Global Risks Perception Survey 2024-
2025 (GRPS), which captures insights from over
900 experts worldwide. The report analyses global
risks through three timeframes to support decision-
makers in balancing current crises and longer-term
priorities. Chapter 1 explores current or immediate-
term (in 2025) and short- to medium-term¹ (to 2027)
risks, and Chapter 2 focuses on the risks emerging
in the long term (to 2035). The report considers
not only the survey findings and the range of
implications, but also provides six in-depth analyses
of selected risk themes.

Below are the key findings of the report, in which
we compare the risk outlooks across the three time
horizons.

### Declining optimism

As we enter 2025, the global outlook is increasingly
fractured across geopolitical, environmental,
societal, economic and technological domains.
Over the last year we have witnessed the expansion
and escalation of conflicts, a multitude of extreme
weather events amplified by climate change,
widespread societal and political polarization, and
continued technological advancements accelerating
the spread of false or misleading information.
Optimism is limited as the danger of miscalculation
or misjudgment by political and military actors
is high. We seem to be living in one of the most
divided times since the Cold War, and this is
reflected in the results of the GRPS, which reveal
a bleak outlook across all three time horizons –
current, short-term and long-term.

A majority of respondents (52%) anticipate an
unsettled global outlook over the short term (next
two years), a similar proportion to last year (Figure A).
Another 31% expect turbulence and 5% a stormy
outlook. Adding together these three categories
of responses shows a combined four percentage
point increase from last year, indicating a heightened
pessimistic outlook for the world to 2027.

Compared to this two-year outlook, the landscape
deteriorates over the 10-year timeframe, with 62%
of respondents expecting stormy or turbulent
times. This long-term outlook has remained similar
to the survey results last year, in terms of its level
of negativity, reflecting respondent skepticism
that current societal mechanisms and governing
institutions are capable of navigating and mending
the fragility generated by the risks we face today.

### Deepening geopolitical and
geoeconomic tensions

Comparing this year’s findings for the world in
2025 with the two-year risk outlook provided
by the GRPS two years ago shows how far

up perceptions have darkened when it comes to
conflict. State-based armed conflict, now ranked
as the #1 current risk by 23% of respondents
(Figure B), was overlooked as a leading two-year
risk two years ago.

In a world that has seen an increasing number
of armed conflicts over the last decade,² national
security considerations are starting to dominate
government agendas. Section 1.3: "Geopolitical
recession" dives deep into the dangers of

unilateralism taking hold in national security
considerations and highlights the worsening
humanitarian impacts of the ongoing conflicts.

The risk of further destabilizing consequences
following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as
in the Middle East and in Sudan are likely to be
amplifying respondents’ concerns beyond 2025 as
well. In the two-year outlook, State-based armed
conﬂict has moved up from #5 to #3 since our
GRPS 2023-24 (Figure C).

Section 1.4: Supercharged economic tensions
explores how global geoeconomic tensions
could unfold. The rise in the two-year ranking of
Geoeconomic confrontation, from #14 last year to
#9 today reflects unease about the path ahead for
global economic relations. The role of technology
in geopolitical tensions also concerns respondents,
with Cyber espionage and warfare ranked #5 in
the two-year outlook.

However, the top risk in 2027 is Misinformation
and disinformation, for the second year in a
row (Figure C). There are many ways in which
a proliferation of false or misleading content is
complicating the geopolitical environment. It is a
leading mechanism for foreign entities to affect
voter intentions; it can sow doubt among the
general public worldwide about what is happening
in conflict zones; or it can be used to tarnish the
image of products or services from another country.

### A growing sense of societal
fragmentation

Societal fractures are central to the overall risks
landscape, as shown in the risk interconnections
map (Figure D). Inequality (wealth, income) is
perceived as the most central risk of all, playing
a significant role in both triggering and being
influenced by other risks. It is contributing to
weakening trust and diminishing our collective
sense of shared values.

As well as Inequality, other societal risks also
feature in the top 10 of the two-year ranking:
Societal polarization, Involuntary migration or
displacement and Erosion of human rights and/
or civic freedoms. The importance ascribed to this
set of societal risks by respondents suggests that
social stability will be fragile over the next two years.

Respondent concern around certain key economic
risks – Economic downturn and Inflation – has
subsided since last year, with these two risks
witnessing the largest falls in the two-year ranking
(Figure 1.5). Nonetheless, the impacts of the cost-
of-living crisis since 2022 contributed to Inequality
becoming the top interconnected risk this year:
Economic downturn, Inflation, and Debt were
selected among the top causes of Inequality by
GRPS respondents.

Although there are fewer societal risks in the top
10 of the 10-year risk ranking than in the top 10
of the two-year risk ranking (two compared to
four, see Figure C), the profound societal fractures
that feature prominently in this report should not
be perceived as solely short-term risks. Looking
ahead to the next decade, Inequality and Societal
polarization continue to feature among the top 10
risks. This is an important pair of risks to watch,
given how related they can be to bouts of social
instability, and in turn to domestic political and to
geostrategic volatility. In super-ageing societies
– such as Japan, South Korea, Italy or Germany –
unfavourable demographic trends could accentuate
these risks over the next 10 years. Pensions
crises and labour shortages in the long-term care
sector are likely to become acute and widespread
problems in super-ageing societies, with no easy
fix for governments. Section 2.5: Super-ageing
societies explores this risk theme.

### Environmental risks - from long-
term concern to urgent reality

The impacts of environmental risks have worsened
in intensity and frequency since the Global Risks
Report was launched in 2006, as discussed in
depth in Section 2.6: Looking back: 20 years of
the Global Risks Report. Moreover, the outlook
for environmental risks over the next decade
is alarming – while all 33 risks in the GRPS are
expected to worsen in severity (Figure E) from the
two-year to the 10-year time horizon, environmental
risks present the most significant deterioration.
Extreme weather events are anticipated to
become even more of a concern than they already
are, with this risk being top ranked in the 10-year
risk list for the second year running. Biodiversity
loss and ecosystem collapse ranks #2 over the
10-year horizon, with a significant deterioration
compared to its two-year ranking.

The GRPS shows generational divergence when it
comes to risk perceptions related to environmental

issues, with younger survey respondents being
more concerned about this over the next 10 years
than older age groups. Take Pollution, for example,
which the under 30s rank as the #3 most severe
risk in 2035, the highest of any age group surveyed.
As noted in last year’s Global Risks Report, there
is also divergence in how Pollution is ranked by
stakeholder, with the public sector placing Pollution
as a top 10 risk in the 10-year ranking, but not the
private sector (Figure 2.4). Section 2.3: Pollution
at a crossroads aims to fill awareness gaps by
exploring under-appreciated pollutant risks that
need to become more prominent in policy agendas
by 2035 – and ideally much sooner given their
significant impacts on health and ecosystems.

### Technological risks - still “under
the radar”

In a year that has seen considerable experimentation
by companies and individuals in making the best use
of AI tools, concerns about Adverse outcomes of
AI technologies are low in the risk ranking on a two-
year outlook. However, complacency around the risks
of such technologies should be avoided given the
fast-paced nature of change in the field of AI and its
increasing ubiquity. Indeed, Adverse outcomes of AI
technologies is one of the risks that climbs the most
in the 10-year risk ranking compared to the two-year
risk ranking (Figure G). In this report we highlight the
role of Generative AI (GenAI) in producing false or
misleading content at scale, and how that relates to
societal polarization. Section 1.5: Technology and
polarization explores this and the broader risks from
greater connectivity, rapid growth in computing power
and more powerful AI tools.

Among the areas experiencing the most rapid
technological advances is the Biotech sector.
Section 2.4: Losing control of biotech? takes
an in-depth look at emerging risks in biotech,
supercharged by AI. Over a 10-year time horizon,
low-probability, high-impact risks exist, including
Intrastate violence from biological terrorism and
Adverse outcomes of frontier technologies
involving accidental or malicious misuse of gene
editing technologies, or even of brain-computer
interfaces. At the same time, such risks do not

### The time to act is now - is
consensus possible in a
fragmenting world?

Deepening divisions and increasing fragmentation
are reshaping international relations and calling into
question whether existing structures are equipped
to tackle the challenges collectively confronting
us. Levels of global cooperation across many
areas of geopolitics and humanitarian issues,
economic relations, and environmental, societal and
technological challenges may reach new lows in the
coming years. Key countries appear to be turning
inward, focusing on mounting domestic economic
or societal concerns, just when they should be
seeking to strengthen multilateral ties to confront
shared challenges.

When asked about the characteristics of the global
political outlook over the next decade, 64% of GRPS
respondents believe that we will face a Multipolar
or fragmented order, in which middle and great
powers contest, set and enforce regional rules and
norms (Figure F). Perceptions in response to this
question have changed little compared to last year.
The Western-led global order is expected to continue
its decline over the next decade but will nonetheless
remain an importance locus of power. Alternative
power centres are likely to strengthen, not just led by
China, but also by key emerging powers, including
India and the Gulf states.

The decade ahead will be pivotal as leaders will be
confronted with increasingly complex global risks.
But to prevent a downward spiral in which citizens
worldwide will be worse off than before, ultimately
there is no option other than to find avenues for
dialogue and collaboration.⁴

# Chapter 1: Global Risks 2025: A world of growing divisions

## 1.1 The world in 2025

The current geopolitical climate, following Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine and with wars raging in
the Middle East and in Sudan, makes it nearly
impossible not to think about such events when
assessing the one global risk expected to present
a material crisis in 2025: close to one-quarter
of survey respondents (23%) selected State-
based armed conflict (proxy wars, civil wars,
coups, terrorism, etc.) as the top risk for 2025
(Figure 1.1). Compared with last year, this risk has
climbed from #8 to #1 in the rankings. Geopolitical
tensions are also associated with the rising risk of
Geoeconomic confrontation (sanctions, tariffs,
investment screening), ranking #3, which is also
driven by Inequality, Societal polarization and
other factors.

pollution from continued use of fossil fuels such as
coal, oil and gas leads to more frequent and severe
extreme weather events. Heatwaves across parts
of Asia; flooding in Brazil, Indonesia and parts of
Europe; wildfires in Canada; and hurricanes Helene
and Milton in the United States are just some recent
examples of such events.

Similar to last year, Misinformation and
disinformation and Societal polarization
remain key current risks, in positions #4 and #5
respectively. The high rankings of these two risks is
not surprising considering the accelerating spread
of false or misleading information, which amplifies
the other leading risks we face, from State-based
armed conflict to Extreme weather events.

The risks associated with Extreme weather events
also is a key concern for the year ahead, with 14%
of respondents selecting it. The burden of climate
change is becoming more evident every year, as

A sense of increasingly fragmented societies is
reflected by four of the top 10 risks expected to
present a material crisis in 2025 being societal in
nature: Societal polarization (6% of respondents),

Global Risks Report 2025

Lack of economic opportunity or unemployment
(3%), Erosion of human rights and/or civic
freedoms (2%) and Inequality (2%).

On the economic front, Inflation is perceived as
less of a concern this year than in 2024. However,
perceptions of the overall economic outlook for
2025 remain fairly pessimistic across all age groups
surveyed. The risk of an Economic downturn
(recession, stagnation) continues to be a common
concern among respondents, coming in at #6 (5%
of respondents), the same position as last year.
The perceived vulnerabilities associated with the
Economic downturn risk are higher for younger
age groups: it is ranked #3 for under 30s, #4 for the
30-39-year age group and #5 for the 40-49-year
age group (Figure 1.2), but does not even feature in
the top 10 for those aged 60 years or older.
