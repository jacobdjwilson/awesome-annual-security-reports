## Foreword

Thank you for reading the State of Pentesting Report 2025, our assessment of the results of thousands of pentests conducted via the Cobalt Offensive Security Platform. Looking back at the very first report in this series, published in 2019, it’s remarkable how much the security landscape has changed, and how we’ve changed with it.

Cobalt, the pioneer in Pentesting as a Service, is now at the forefront of testing AI models and applications. We’ve found that AI security is lagging far behind the pace of AI adoption. Our LLM testing finds more vulnerabilities than any other type of test, and only 21% of the highest risk LLM vulnerabilities are resolved.

At the same time, security leaders are unfazed, but perhaps overconfident. While 81% are certain they meet security compliance, pentesting data tells a more complicated story. Although SLAs aim for two-week remediation windows, the real time to resolution often stretches to months or even years. It takes over three months for just half of the most serious issues to be resolved.

Development and security teams have made strides in reducing high-risk vulnerabilities, and the time to resolve these findings dropped by two-thirds over the past decade. These improvements were likely driven by increased adoption of structured pentesting programs over ad hoc testing, and more rigorous security standards during software development.

However, the persistence of unaddressed, exploitable vulnerabilities underscores the need for programmatic approaches that go beyond meeting SLA timelines to ensure true risk reduction.

At Cobalt, we understand the dangers of hidden security vulnerabilities, including ones frequently missed by automated scanners. As our industry evolves alongside growing investment in AI solutions, we continue to innovate. Yet our identity remains unchanged, centered around the expertise of the Cobalt Core, our team of over 450 pentesters.

Within these pages, you’ll find an in-depth examination of pentesting results, and insights about the challenges security teams are facing. We expect these insights to help security leaders guide their organizations towards better offensive security programs, for greater assurance and reduced risk.

## Executive Summary

Knowledge is power—and in security, that knowledge must come from the right insights.

Security leaders feel confident in their posture, but pentest data tells a more complex story: Critical vulnerabilities often remain unresolved, hidden beneath the surface of automated scans and service-level agreement (SLA) checkboxes. Even as remediation speeds improve, one-third of serious issues still slip through the cracks—and with genAI introducing new, high-impact risks, traditional approaches fall short.

That’s why pentesting is essential. It transforms assumptions into evidence, surface-level confidence into actionable clarity. Structured, expert-led pentesting delivers the knowledge security teams need to understand their true risk—and the power to reduce it.

### Key Findings

#### THE PERCEPTION AND REALITY OF SECURITY DON’T ALWAYS AGREE
- Most organizations (81%) are quite confident that their security posture is up to snuff. Yet pentesting never fails to reveal hidden vulnerabilities.
- Three-quarters of organizations have set SLAs specifying that pentest findings should be fixed in two weeks or less. Few meet this goal.
- The median time to resolve (MTTR) stands at 67 days for all pentest findings. That’s five times longer than the two-week SLA set by most organizations.
- Less than half (48%) of all findings ever get resolved. That jumps to 69% for the riskiest findings, but that still leaves many open vulnerabilities.

#### AI IS QUICKLY EMERGING AS A MAJOR SECURITY RISK
- Nearly all firms say they’re integrating genAI into their products; just 66% are actively assessing the security (including pentesting) of these solutions.
- 32% of all LLM pentest findings are rated high risk. That’s 2.5 times the overall proportion of 13% and the highest level among all types of pentests we conduct.
- Only 21% of serious findings from LLM pentests get resolved. That’s understandable given the newness of the tech. But that doesn’t negate the risk.

#### PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TO REDUCE RISK, BUT THERE’S MUCH MORE TO DO
- In 2017, only 27% of serious pentest findings were resolved. That proportion soon doubled to 55% but has hovered at that level ever since.
- In 2024, serious findings were fixed in one-third of the time it took back in 2017 (37 versus 112 days). That’s shaving 75 days off the exposure window!
- The largest organizations take over a month longer to resolve serious findings than the smallest firms (61 versus 27 days). Managing risk gets harder as you grow.

## Pentesting Perspectives

Before diving into all the issues Cobalt pentesters identified, let’s review what we learned from our survey of 450 security leaders and practitioners about how penetration tests fit into their security programs.

Let’s start with the most common internal justifications for conducting pentests. The top reason selected by 94% of respondents was that pentests are foundational to ensuring a strong security posture. This captures the assurance role of pentesting and reflects the reality that most breaches don’t occur because the victim had no defenses. Rather, the defenses they had weren’t as solid as they thought.

It’s probably no surprise to learn that most respondents (91%) chose compliance as a major reason why they do pentests. What may surprise some is that even more of them (92%) say pentests are important to their organization’s strategy and senior leadership. Over three-quarters of firms (and 92% of retailers) claim that pentesting improves customer trust.

Let’s keep pulling on the “improves customer trust” thread. We asked participants about the types of security assurance commonly requested by their customers and regulators. Third-party pentest reports were the most common selection, at 59% of respondents. It’s noteworthy that pentests rate higher than vulnerability scans and compliance certifications.

This bar chart shows the top reasons: Foundational for modern programs to ensure a strong security posture (94%), Important to our organization’s strategy and senior leadership (92%), Critical for meeting our business and compliance goals (91%), and Improves customer trust in our software products (75%).](Source: State of Pentesting Report 2025)

![Figure 2: What types of security assurance do your customers or regulators most commonly request to validate your software’s security? This bar chart shows: 3rd Party Penetration Test Report (59%), 3rd Party Code Review (45%), Internal Security Test Results (43%), Vulnerability Scan Reports (39%), Compliance Certification (SOC 2, ISO 27001, ETC) (38%), and None of the Above (1%).](Source: State of Pentesting Report 2025)

There are several factors that tend to trigger requests to validate third-party software using pentests. Top choices include software that processes sensitive data or is critical to the organization’s mission. Over a third of organizations test all vendor software that gets built into their products, though including those that answered “all of the above” raises that to over 60%.

![Figure 3: What type(s) of commercial software do you require a pentest from vendors? This bar chart shows: Software built into our products (60%), Software that processes customer data (59%), Mission critical software for our organization (58%), All of the above (35%), and Software that processes PII (34%).](Source: State of Pentesting Report 2025)

Pentests are also seen as a way to reduce liability for security issues. Per the responses below, that liability is seen at both the personal and corporate levels. Furthermore, a quarter of respondents believe security assurance to be so important that they’ve considered quitting when that obligation isn’t taken seriously enough. Keep these (rather idealistic) responses in mind when we get to the section analyzing the reality of pentest remediation timelines.

![Figure 4: Concerns over liability related to unaddressed security issues. This bar chart shows: It causes corporate liability if exploitable vulnerabilities remain unaddressed (80%), I feel personal liability in knowing exploitable vulnerabilities are unaddressed (68%), I worry about the legal repercussions of unfixed exploitable vulnerabilities (57%), and I’ve considered leaving my job because security is not taken seriously enough (25%).](Source: State of Pentesting Report 2025)

It’s obvious from the responses above that pentests are viewed as an important part of modern security programs. But how often are they conducted? Just over a quarter of respondents do annual pentests, and another 15% say it’s a semi-annual activity for their firms. That means more than half of organizations conduct pentests more than twice a year, with quarterly being the most common cadence (30%).

![Figure 5: How often does your organization conduct pentests? This pie chart shows: Quarterly (30%), Annually (27%), Biannually (18%), Semi-annually (15%), Monthly (8%), and Continuously (1%).](Source: State of Pentesting Report 2025)

Taken together, these survey responses suggest that proactive pentesting is widely viewed as an essential part of cybersecurity programs as well as a major business driver.

The next section analyzes findings from penetration tests conducted via Cobalt over the last decade. You’ll see right from the start that the perspectives shared here don’t always align with reality.

## Top Pentest Findings

According to most survey respondents, this should be a fairly short section. More than 8 in 10 of them expressed confidence that their organization’s security posture
