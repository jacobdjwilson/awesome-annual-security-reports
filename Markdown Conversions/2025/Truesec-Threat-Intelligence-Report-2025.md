## Developments in the Threat Landscape

### Positive effects following cybersecurity investments

The year 2024 was a milestone for cybersecurity in the Nordics as we are starting to see the positive effects of increased cybersecurity. The threat of ransomware and other forms of cybercrime remains as dangerous as before, but our metrics now appear to show that organizations that do invest in meeting the challenge markedly will reduce the risks.

While this is a positive sign, it’s important to observe that there are no indications that the threats are abating. Our SOC has disarmed a similar amount of intrusion attempts in 2024 as in the previous year. The increase in cyber intrusion attempts we have observed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine shows that geopolitical events continue to shape cybercrime too.

As many organizations improve their cybersecurity, cybercriminals become more opportunistic. Ransomware groups still have a good understanding of which industries are most likely to cave in to their demands, but they primarily attack where they manage to get a foothold. “Don’t be low-hanging fruit” is even more relevant today.

Truesec has also observed that opportunistic cybercriminals are shifting to ransomware attacks on smaller enterprises. The traditional business model, so-called big-game-hunting, was to target large organizations capable of paying large sums of ransom. Attacks on small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) generate less revenue, but if they are less protected, the attack is swifter and likelier to succeed. It’s also possible that there are more unreported ransomware attacks against smaller organizations that don’t show up in our statistics.

While SMBs seldom have the same resources as the large corporations, they typically face a less complex threat landscape, since cybercriminals don’t want to invest too much time and resources in an attack that will not generate a massive payoff. This year Truesec devotes a part of this report specifically for advice for how SMBs can improve their cybersecurity based on the current threat landscape.

![Truesec ransomware incident engagement per industry sector in 2024](Image description)

The two largest so-called ransomware-as-a-service groups, BlackCat and Lockbit, have both had their infrastructure hacked and capabilities degraded. Some ransomware affiliates now appear to forego the RaaS portals and act alone. The criminal ecosystem is resilient, however, and new ransomware-as-a-service groups have emerged in their place, like RansomHub and Cicada3301.

The geopolitical tensions in the world continue to influence the cyber threat landscape. Government directed cyber sabotage and hacktivism is used to amplify information operations to intimidate and influence the population of Western nations. Much of what passes as “hacktivism” is in fact government sponsored hybrid war. 2024 also saw an ongoing campaign of international law enforcement striking at important infrastructure used for ransomware and other cybercrime.

![Breakdown of types of Truesec cyber incident engagements in 2024](Image description)

Another worrying trend that Truesec highlighted last year, is that as Western sanctions start to harm nations like Iran and North Korea, government controlled cyber actors are turning to cybercrime to finance their activities. North Korea’s military intelligence has financed its operations with cybercrime for years, but this year more evidence appeared indicating that cyber espionage groups from Iran are now collaborating with Russian ransomware criminals. Whether adversaries use cybercrime to finance their activities or simply allow it to continue as a bargaining chip, cybercrime will continue to be linked to the geopolitical landscape.

As technical cyber defenses continue to improve, many threat actors will instead focus on social engineering and fraud to gain access to networks. IT personnel and software developers are becoming the focus of many such attacks, since they typically have accounts with much higher privilege than regular users.

Open source code sharing sites like Github are constantly filled with fake projects and forked code bundles that include malware. Even fake job interviews can be used to lure software developers to download malware, allowing criminals to take over the corporate network they are on. Securing your organization’s software supply chain is a vital part of cybersecurity.

Other forms of cybercrime still flourish. As predicted last year, some cybercriminals are now beginning to use AI to enhance their social engineering. Cybercriminals are using LLM and chatbots to generate texts for phishing mail. More sophisticated cybercriminals use deep-fake technology to mimic real people in online meetings to conduct fraud. Truesec has observed a rise in cyber enabled fraud, so-called business email compromise (BEC) where cybercriminals hack corporate mail accounts and use this access to send email with fraudulent payment information. Here we have also seen examples of Chinese cybercriminals now operating out of Africa.

Our data indicates that large Nordic enterprises appear to have learned their lesson, and investing in cybersecurity has allowed them to break the trend of increasing ransomware attacks - this is a positive trend but hardly a cause for relaxation. As threats continue to evolve, it’s important to stay up to date with the latest threats and prepare to meet them.

## Breaching the Network

### Initial attack vectors: Ransomware and Extortion

Ransomware incidents usually begin with one of two initial attack vectors that are also to some extent tied to different business models used by the cybercriminals. More than 40% of all ransomware incidents begin with cybercriminals exploiting vulnerabilities in external facing security applications, such as VPN solutions and firewalls, that allow remote code execution.

Most of the other ransomware incidents begin with some form of identity-based attack. Identity-based attacks range from using stolen credentials obtained by information-stealing malware to simple brute force password-guessing. They all involve obtaining credentials and then just logging in to the victim’s account.

Information stealing malware can be installed on victim machines using a range of different methods, including phishing mail, compromised web sites, and infected code packages on code sharing sites.

While supply chain attacks are a legitimate worry, especially for larger organizations, they still constitute a minority of all ransomware attacks. Over 90% of the ransomware incidents that Truesec handled in 2024 could have been avoided by blocking incoming password guessing, strictly enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and active vulnerability management.

![Initial Attack Vector in successful ransomware attacks](Image description)

### Business Email Compromise

Business Email Compromise (BEC) and other forms of cyber fraud are aimed at email accounts and almost always begin with a phishing email. The phishing email contains a link to a fake login page that steals credentials, session cookies or other tokens, that allows the criminals to take over a mail account and exploit it.

Stolen session cookies have a short duration, and BEC criminals usually exploit a successful phishing within hours of a victim having fallen for the phishing mail. An information stealing trojan can provide updated account information as long as it remains undetected.

The reason is not known but may include a business model where access is often obtained by a so-called initial access broker (IAB) that sells access to ransomware criminals, which can mean that ransomware criminals will not use the access until days or weeks after the initial breach.

It is worth noting that while BEC criminals generally are less skilled hackers than ransomware criminals, it is seldom that ransomware criminals use token stealing phishing mail to gain access to networks.

## The Future of Cyber Extortion

Historically, cyber-enabled extortion has had many faces: ever since ransomware became a billion-dollar criminal industry, cyber extortion has become the top worry for most organizations. Most industries today rely on IT systems for their day-to-day operations, and if criminals deny them the use of their IT environment, production can grind to a halt, with immediate loss of revenue for every hour during the ongoing incident.

Cyber extortion is more than just ransomware, however. Sometimes even threats of a crude distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that can disrupt web applications that online business relies on, such as customer portals, can be used for extortion.

Another common form of cyber extortion is to steal confidential data and threaten to release it to the public, something which can potentially lead to loss of customer confidence, lawsuits or exposure to being in breach of data privacy legislation.

Whenever an organization is dependent on an IT system for availability or confidentiality, this can be exploited by cybercriminals for extortion and should consequently be adequately protected.

Many cybercriminals have a keen understanding of which type of victims are most vulnerable to various forms of cyber extortion. Organizations that depend on customer confidence in handling sensitive personal information, such as legal firms or private healthcare institutions, are prime targets for data leak extortion, while organizations depending on customer confidence in stable access to online services, such as online shopping and financial institutions, can be targeted with DDoS extortion.

While cybercriminals are often opportunistic, it’s very important to understand that ALL organizations with an online presence can be subject to intrusion attempts with the purpose of a limited or full-scale cyber extortion.

The cybercriminal ecosystem is ever changing and in active development and while ransomware is still trending, the future battle between defenders and attackers is very likely to include an extortion component.

## Protect Your Data

When organizations turn digital, their knowledge is their competitive edge. This also turns their intellectual property into the most desirable target for threat actors, which means that such information has to be protected from possible theft.

Innovation and knowledge are keys to success for most modern businesses. For many corporations today, a significant portion of their value lies in unique knowledge and intellectual property that is stored digitally. Stealing this data can provide competitors with information that allows them to copy their production methods without having to invest in the research and development, allowing them to undercut prices.

Data theft can also allow a company to game their competitors’ bids and win tenders or to gain privileged information that can be used in litigation battles. In principle, all exclusive knowledge that can be monetized and is stored digitally can become the target of data theft.

Cyber espionage, trying to gain an advantage by obtaining confidential information, has been a part of the digital world for a long time. Initially such data theft was mostly the domain of state intelligence agencies that spy on national secrets, but today it is also conducted to support business.

In addition to the large national spy agencies, there is now a growing industry of private contractors that offer to conduct cyberattacks and steal confidential corporate information that can be leveraged by competitors. Many such private cyber espionage actors also have deals with their governments that allow them to operate with relative freedom, even if they are exposed.

This means that organizations don’t need to possess the capacity to conduct data theft themselves to hack their competitors, they can just rent it. As the rules-based international order is now under strain, such data theft is expected to continue to grow in the future.

## Modern Forms of Cyber Sabotage

Acts of cyber sabotage are now an integral part of modern conflicts. As governments in Europe are repeatedly warning that the threat of conventional war in Europe is rising, this means that conflicts in the cyber domain will also likely continue to increase, resulting in more cyber sabotage.

With almost all modern government and business being reliant on IT technology today, they can be disrupted by targeting their digital support through cyberattacks. Destructive cyberattacks and other acts of cyber sabotage are a form of violence. The aim is to disrupt, harm or intimidate a perceived opponent, at least in the eyes of the actor’s supporters.

Cyber sabotage is almost always political in nature. Even when some hacktivists conduct cyber sabotage as a form of performance to solicit money from their online fans, they are relying on their audience’s political preferences to get their support.

The ultimate form of violence is war, and the worst form of destructive cyberattacks is usually associated with cyber warfare units. Destructive cyber warfare attacks aim to degrade or destroy IT systems that support the adversaries’ war effort, either by directly affecting their ability to wage war, or indirectly by hurting civilian morale.

However, cyber warfare is just the most extreme form of cyber sabotage. Other forms of cyber sabotage include sabotage such as “hacktivism” that is more akin to digital terrorism, than outright acts of war. Even simple forms of cyber sabotage, such as distributed denial-of-service attacks and web defacement, are technically a form of cyber terrorism as its primary aim is to frighten and intimidate adversaries, while projecting an image of strength to your own side.

## Combating Cybercrime Together

### Global joint operations

In 2024, Interpol, Europol, FBI, and private sector organizations have made significant strides in combating cybercrime. These efforts reflect a coordinated global response to the evolving threat of cybercrime, aiming to protect individuals and businesses worldwide. The operations of law enforcement during 2024 focused mainly on attacking the infrastructure of the cybercriminal ecosystem, rather than going after specific threat actors. The operations had a real impact on the cybercriminal ecosystem, leading to several changes in the threat actors’ modus operandi and abilities to collaborate.

Europol’s Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) of 2024 highlighted several significant joint operations aimed at combating cybercrime.

### Operation Cronos

In this joint venture with law enforcement agencies from 10 different countries, Europol disrupted the operations of the LockBit group. 34 servers linked to phishing, ransomware, and information stealers were dismantled. The operation led to the arrest of 41 individuals, with 65 others still under investigation. Authorities seized 59 servers and 43 electronic devices, including laptops, mobile phones, and hard disks. From the data analyzed in the takedown, several decryption tools were made public on the No More Ransom portal.

### Operation Dark Hunt

This operation targeted dark web marketplaces involved in the sale of illegal goods and services. It led to the arrest of multiple suspects across Europe and the seizure of significant amounts of cryptocurrency.

### Operation Nova

Focused on dismantling the operations of groups using LockerGoga, MegaCortex, HIVE and the Dharma ransomware. This operation resulted in the arrest of several high-profile ransomware operators and the seizure of their infrastructure.

### Operation Synergia II

Conducted by Interpol from April to August 2024, this operation achieved significant results in the fight against cybercrime. Over 22,000 malicious IP addresses and servers were taken down and more than 200 cryptocurrency accounts were frozen. Two LockBit actors were arrested in Poland and Ukraine.

One notable arrest during Operation Synergia II involved a cybercriminal in Estonia. This individual was linked to a network responsible for distributing phishing emails and deploying information stealers. During the operation, Estonian authorities seized over 80GB of server data, which included sensitive information used in various cyber attacks. This arrest highlights the importance of international cooperation in tracking and apprehending cybercriminals, as well as the effectiveness of coordinated efforts in disrupting malicious activities.

### Operation Endgame

The FBI, in collaboration with international law enforcement agencies, conducted this operation that had a significant impact on global cybercrime rates in 2024. It dismantled the infrastructure of several major malware groups, including IcedID, Smokeloader, Pikabot, and Bumblebee. This disruption significantly reduced the operational capabilities of these groups. Following the operation, there was a noticeable decline in the number of cyberattacks, particularly those involving ransomware and information stealers.

Authorities seized significant amounts of illegal proceeds, which disrupted the financial operations of cybercriminal networks. This included freezing assets and confiscating cryptocurrency used in criminal transactions.

### Operation Nordic Shield

This operation targeted a sophisticated phishing network that had been defrauding individuals and businesses across the Nordic region. The coordinated effort led to the arrest of 15 suspects and the seizure of numerous electronic devices used in the scams.

### Operation Arctic Fox

Focused on dismantling a ransomware group that had been targeting critical infrastructure, this operation involved law enforcement agencies from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. It resulted in the arrest of key members of the group and the disruption of their operations.

The Nordic countries have also conducted several successful joint operations to combat cybercrime in the region.

The Swedish Cybercrime Center (SC3), together with the regional centers, within the Swedish Police Authority, has throughout the year of 2024 participated in several international operations. Swedish Police played a significant role in Operation Cronos, disrupting the world’s largest ransomware operation Lockbit, as well as the DDoS operation performed by Anonymous Sudan, resulting in both arrests and the seize of criminal infrastructure and financial resources.

Sweden continues to have a liaison officer within Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce J-CAT, making international cooperation easy and efficient. International cooperation is increasing with the realization that no country can fight international cybercrime on their own.

On a national level, the admin, and several moderators, of the largest Swedish darkweb drugsite has been prosecuted and sentenced to imprisonment for many years. Swedish police have supported Finnish police in taking down a similar darkweb drugsite in Finland with digital infrastructure in Sweden.

Swedish police continue to increase the ability to intervene in the digital arena, to secure evidence and increase cooperation with private actors in the cyber security sector.

A crucial part of law enforcement and the ability to prosecute cyber criminals is the will of the victims of cybercrime to report the incidents to the police. Every bit of data is a step towards an international operation, seizure of criminal infrastructure and imprisonment of perpetrators.

## Dissecting the Cicada

The Cicada3301 appears to be a traditional ransomware-as-a-service group that offers a platform for double extortion, with both a ransom-ware and a data leak site, to its affiliates. The first published leak on the group’s data leak site is dated June 25, 2024. Four days later, on June 29, the group published an invitation to potential affiliates to join their ransomware-as-a-service platform on the cybercrime forum Ramp.

The Cicada3301 ransomware has several interesting similarities to the ALPHV ransomware.

*   Both are written in Rust
*   Both use ChaCha20 for encryption
*   Both use almost identical commands to shutdown VM and remove snapshots
*   Both use –ui command parameters to provide a graphic output on encryption
*   Both use the same convention for naming files, but changing “RECOVER-“ransomware extension”-FILES.txt” to “RECOVER-“ransomware extension”-DATA.txt”
*   How the key parameter is used to decrypt the ransomware note

Analysis of the code has also shown several similarities in the code with the ALPHV ransomware.

Below is an example of code from Cicada3301 that’s almost identical to ALPHV

![Example of code from Cicada3301 that's almost identical to ALPHV](Image description)

### Analysis of the Threat Actor

The initial attack vector was the threat actor using valid credentials, likely brute-forced against a NetSupport Manager appliance. The IP address 91.92.249.203, used by the threat actor, has been tied to a botnet known as “Brutus” that, in turn, has been linked to a broad campaign of password guessing various VPN solutions. This botnet has been active since at least March 2024, when the first article about it was published, but possibly longer. This indicates that likely the operators behind the Brutus botnet have at least a transactional relationship with the ransomware group behind Cicada3301.

The group could also have teamed up with the malware developer behind ALPHV. This individual appears to have worked for several different ransomware groups in the past.

Regardless of whether Cicada3301 is a rebrand of ALPHV, or they have a ransomware written by the same developer as ALPHV, or if they have simply copied parts of ALPHV to make their own ransomware, the timeline suggests that the demise of BlackCat and the emergence of first the Brutus botnet and then the Cicada3301 ransomware operation may possibly be all connected. More investigation is needed before we can say anything for certain, however.

### Technical Details

At the start of the ransomware main function, there are several references to parameters that should be passed as an argument to binary, using clap::args, that hold different functionalities that can be used in combination as well.

The binary has a built-in help function with explanations of the different parameters and how they should be used.

#### The ransomware parameters

Below are parameters discovered in the ransomware binary:

*   `ui` prints the result of the encryption to the screen, showing which files have been encrypted.
*   `no_vm_ss` encrypts files without shutting down the virtual machines that are running on ESXi. Also deletes snapshots.
*   `key` inputs the decryption key. It must be provided, otherwise the binary will fail and show “Key is invalid” on the screen.
*   `check_key_and_get_rec_text` checks length of the key. If the length is less than 0x2c the binary will terminate directly.

#### File encryption

The first function is to extract another public PGP key, stored in the data section. This key is used to encrypt the symmetric key that is generated for file encryption.

It then creates the file that will store the ransomware message in the folder of the encrypted files. It will be named “RECOVER-’ending of encrypted file’-DATA.txt”

Then it checks the size of the file. If it is greater than 0x6400000 it will encrypt the file in parts, and if it is smaller, the whole file will be encrypted.

The files will then be encrypted with a symmetric key generated by OsRng using ChaCha20. After the encryption check_key_and_get_rec_text is done it encrypts the ChaCha20 key with the provided RSA key and finally writes the extension to the encrypted file. The file extension is also added to the end of the encrypted file together with the RSA encrypted ChaCha20 key.

Inside the encryption function there is also a list of file extensions where most of them are related to either documents or pictures. This indicates that the ransomware has been used to encrypt Windows systems before being ported to ransomware ESXi hosts.

## A Major Concern for Small and Medium Businesses

### Cyber criminals targeting organizations with smaller cybersecurity investments

In the Nordic region, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) make up a significant portion of the business landscape. Approximately 99% of all companies in the Nordics are considered SMBs. This high percentage underscores the vital role that SMBs play in the economy, contributing to innovation, employment, and economic growth.

SMBs in Sweden contribute significantly to the economy. They generate approximately 51.4% of the value added to the Swedish GDP. This further highlights the crucial role SMBs play in driving economic growth and employment in the country.

In the contemporary digital landscape, cybersecurity has become a paramount concern for organizations of all sizes. However, SMBs often find themselves at a significant disadvantage. Cyber criminals strategically prioritize attacking organizations that have smaller investments in cybersecurity, leading to them becoming an easier target for the criminals. Understanding why this is the case, and the potential consequences, is crucial for these businesses to protect themselves effectively.

### The Danger of Smaller Investments in Cybersecurity

Small and medium businesses typically operate with limited financial resources, which often translates to smaller budgets allocated for cybersecurity. This limitation can manifest in various forms, such as outdated software, inadequate security technologies, lack of regular security audits, and insufficient employee training programs. Cyber criminals are acutely aware of these vulnerabilities and exploit them with precision.

Many small business owners mistakenly believe they are too small to be targeted, leading to complacency in implementing necessary security measures. Despite their size, small businesses often hold valuable data, such as customer information and payment details, which can be lucrative for attackers. The fact that many SMBs are also part of the supply chain of larger organizations may lead to them becoming collateral damage in the hunt for larger prey.

The inadequate investment in IT and cybersecurity makes SMBs vulnerable for several reasons:

*   **Lack of Advanced Cybersecurity Solutions**: Smaller investments often result in basic or inefficient security measures, making it easier for cyber criminals to breach systems undetected.
*   **Limited IT Staff**: SMBs may not have dedicated IT security personnel, leading to slower response times and less effective incident management.
*   **Unpatched Systems**: Regular updates and patches are essential for security, but these may be neglected due to resource constraints, leaving systems vulnerable. Vulnerable IT systems is the most common intrusion attack vector represented in our ransomware incident response engagements.
*   **Inadequate Employee Training**: Without sufficient training, employees might fall prey to phishing schemes and other social engineering tactics.

### Consequences of Cyberattacks on SMBs

The repercussions of a cyberattack on a small or medium-sized business can be devastating and far-reaching. The immediate financial impact can be crippling. Costs associated with data recovery, legal fees, fines, and compensation to affected customers can quickly escalate. For many SMBs, these expenses can threaten their very existence.

Trust is a critical asset for any business. A breach can severely damage a company’s reputation, leading to loss of customers and revenue. Rebuilding trust and a positive brand image can take years and substantial effort.

Business operations often get disrupted, leading to downtime and loss of productivity. This disruption not only affects the company’s immediate ability to generate revenue but also its long-term operational efficiency.

Even small businesses are subject to regulations that require them to protect customer data. Failure to do so can result in hefty fines and legal actions. Additionally, compliance with legal requirements can become more stringent post-attack, adding to the company’s burden.

### Mitigating the Risks

Investing in cybersecurity is crucial to protect against potential threats and ensure business continuity. For small businesses, it’s generally recommended to allocate 4% of their total revenue to IT. Within this IT budget, 5-20% should be dedicated specifically to cybersecurity. This range can vary based on factors such as the industry, the sensitivity of the data handled, and the specific risks faced by the business. Not making these investments can have severe consequences, all of which come at a higher cost than the suggested investment.

First and foremost, if you don’t have the resources to build your own capabilities, consider outsourcing. This is just as valid for cybersecurity as for IT Operations. It’s hard, if not impossible, to scale these kinds of specialties in-house for a small organization.

Secondly, ensure that all IT operations follow best practices with a strong emphasis on keeping everything up to date and current, both when it comes to software as well as hardware. Unmanaged, Unknown or Forgotten systems, applications or devices, is still the number one attack vector leading to breaches.

Having strong authentication implemented on ALL systems and solutions, whether they are Internet facing or not, greatly reduces the risk of a breach. Implement authentication mechanisms that are as user-friendly as they are secure, such as Yubico’s Yubikeys.

Implement and verify secure backup solutions, where the backup is not reachable from the environment it protects. Ensure that you regularly have full verification tests on the backups into a production-like environment. This will be the last line of defense if an opportunistic threat actor attacks and encrypts the environment.

Since no defense is an absolute safeguard, consider acquiring cyber insurance. The insurance will help with the non-technical consequences of a breach, such as costs of business interruption and 3rd party coverage such as legal costs and liabilities. To make sure that you acquire the right insurance for your organization, always consult with an insurance broker specializing in cyber insurance.

The cyber insurance industry has recently recovered from a few very hard and unprofitable years. Following a large uptake for larger organizations, the insurance industry has now made insurance a real alternative also for smaller organizations. A few years ago, SMBs only cyber insurance option were insurance policies that were very limited in scope and/or insurance limit. In many cases, these policies gave a false sense of security and many organizations found out the hard way that they didn’t have the insurance cover they expected. These policies are still out there, especially available from national insurers, but there are now better options available.

Luckily, the process for buying cyber insurance has evolved drastically. From 20+ page applications that were difficult if not impossible to answer in full, SMBs can now buy insurance based only of readings from external scans. This change in process has had a very positive impact on the pricing, with rates dropped about 30% in the last 12 months.

In order to qualify for cyber insurance, there are some technical requirements that each company must implement. These are typically not too difficult to overcome, and they all give meaningful protection. Caveat emptor – some insurance companies still have conditions that can jeopardize cover in case there is an incident.

While the exact requirements vary, some are consistent across most insurers:

1.  MFA must be applied for all remote access. This requirement is typically not too difficult to live up to, but check the fine print. Also, don’t forget to disable access on user name and password only. MFA isn’t very useful if it’s not required.
2.  Backups – insurers are increasingly demanding that their clients have backups off site. Typically restoration tests aren’t required, but can be. As the saying goes – back ups are nothing, restoration is everything.
3.  Monitoring – moving away from accepting Anti Virus as a sufficient security mechanism, insurers are rapidly starting to require EDR to be in place. EDR is good and well, but means very little if there’s no one to manage the alerts. Make sure that you have someone to monitor your network 24/7, because statistics indicate that the majority of incidents that become insurance claims are initiated on Fridays.

There are additional requirements that various insurers can ask for, such as segmentation between IT and OT, email security requirements, phishing trainings etc. Most requirements are manageable, but always check the requirements before signing up for a policy.

In summary, cyber insurance has become a credible alternative also for SMBs, you just need to ensure that the policy you buy works for your business.

## When the Threat goes Silent

### How attack trends are shifting in the enterprise environment

In 2024, we noticed a shift in the attacks against enterprise organizations. From having been targeted with disruptive attacks, just like the ones now primarily affecting SMBs, the attackers went silent. Silent but not gone. In general, it revolves around the purpose and goal of the threat actors - where it used to be extortion through the use of ransomware, it now became data theft, espionage or creating a link in a supply chain.

What led to this change? Well, all over the world, investments in cybersecurity solutions for enterprises continue to grow, making the smash and grab attacks become more time consuming and difficult. Also, threat actors are finding it more challenging getting paid by organizations that they have crippled by ransomware. Data has shown that an organization is more willing to pay a threat actor that just stole data without disrupting the business with an encryption attack.

What will this entail for enterprises? The major concern is that most of the cybersecurity solutions that are either in place or under implementation, are built to detect and respond against malicious behaviors. Advanced attackers that don’t disrupt the business operations or perform malicious activities will simply go undetected. Additionally, it’s always more difficult to allocate budget to counter a threat that’s not perceived as imminent.

### So, what should Enterprises do?

To be able to defend against the silent threats we need to have visibility in all aspects of our IT estates. Now, this fact is true for all sorts of defensive capabilities. But for the silent threat we have to go even further. We need visibility, logging and detection everywhere with deep insights into our own information flows. We need to ensure that we trust no one and no activity is by default marked as benign. It’s not a matter of not trusting anything, but rather ensuring that everything is verified, and nothing goes unnoticed.

When considering visibility and detection, you need to have a full suite of detection services monitoring endpoints, identities and networks, including detection on the application layer and in the cloud through logs (SIEM). These tools must be leveraged to their full potential and deployed in tandem; supporting each other, empowered by behavior-oriented detection rules, and continuously realigned to cover emerging threats and new modi. They ensure retained capacity over time, even if attack infrastructure changes and, if done right, will push the asymmetrical game of hide and detect into the favor of the defender.

It is also a matter of protecting your business-critical intellectual property and anything else that might be of interest to a competitor or antagonist. To be able to do this you first and foremost must understand and know what this is. When you have come to terms with what it is that you must protect at all costs, you then need to understand what you are up against. This is where Threat Intelligence comes in. Looking at yourself from both the outside and inside, who are your main concerns and how do they operate? Is your IT estate adequately protected against their Techniques, Tools and Procedures? If not, then you need to urgently implement protection against these gaps in your defense.

Of course, this doesn’t mean that Enterprises can stop worrying about ransomware and other opportunistic attacks, they will happen if that door is open to the opportunistic threat actors.

Properly defending against threats from both the outside and inside, especially the silent threat, is equally about best practice, continuous improvement, information security, cybersecurity – as well as IT Operations and Lifecycle Management.

## The AI Revolution in Cybersecurity

### Opportunities and risks in 2025

Generative AI surged into the mainstream with the release of ChatGPT in late 2023, sparking an explosive wave of technological adoption. Once the domain of innovators and niche technical applications, AI quickly became integrated into everyday professional and consumer experiences. By 2024, generative AI and machine learning have become pivotal in enabling industries, including cybersecurity.

### AI as a Threat Amplifier for Cyberattacks

From a threat actor’s perspective, AI is revolutionizing the execution of cyberattacks. The primary threat currently lies in its ability to automate and enhance existing attack strategies rather than invent entirely new ones. Tools powered by generative AI simplify traditionally complex tasks such as reverse-engineering security patches, creating malicious code, and generating convincing phishing emails. This reduces the skill threshold for attackers, allowing a broader pool of individuals to conduct sophisticated operations at scale.

One notable evolution, that does leverage AI for a previously impossible attack
