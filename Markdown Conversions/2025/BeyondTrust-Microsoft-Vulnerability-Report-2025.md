## Executive Summary

After celebrating a 10th anniversary in 2023 and “turning it up to 11” in 2024, what does the 12th annual edition of the Microsoft Vulnerabilities Report have in store for us? According to Wikipedia, “since antiquity, the number (12) has generally represented perfection, entirety, or cosmic order,” which means we have set a high bar for this year’s report!

So, what have we learned from twelve years of Microsoft vulnerability analyses? Benjamin Franklin once wrote, “In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” Had that quote been written today, perhaps Franklin would have also included software vulnerabilities, alongside death and taxes, as one of life’s certainties.

While software vulnerabilities may be a certainty in life, this report has consistently shown there are clear ways to proactively mitigate the risks and increase cyber resilience across your Microsoft environment.

We have charted how improvements to Microsoft software architectures and development practices have helped drive down the number of critical vulnerabilities over the years. This newest edition of the report is no exception to that trend, with critical vulnerabilities dropping to an all-time low of 78 in 2024, compared to 84 in 2023, and a whopping 196 back in 2020.

For IT practitioners, timely patching of systems and applying the principle of least privilege (PoLP) remain the key defenses in mitigating the risk of software vulnerabilities. Patching systems in a timely manner reduces the window of opportunity for exploitation, thus, lessening the likelihood of a breach. Applying the principle of least privilege ensures that users—both human and machine—are running with only the privilege and access they absolutely need. A least privilege approach also goes a long way toward minimizing the “blast radius” in the event of a zero-day or exploitation of a vulnerability.

In addition to our usual data slicing and dicing to identify the key trends for you, this report checks in on how things are going for Microsoft. After Microsoft’s Secure Future Initiative (SFI) rollout in 2023—a response to the widespread criticism they incurred following a series of high-profile security issues—Microsoft pledged to change. Our report also examines what that change looks like.

As in years past, we have again assembled a panel of some of the world’s leading cybersecurity experts to weigh in on the report findings as we collectively set our sights forward on emerging threats, new vulnerabilities, and best practices for building cyber resilience across the enterprise, and society at large.

Read on to better understand, identify, and address the risks facing your organization within the Microsoft ecosystem.

## Key Findings and Data Highlights

### Key Findings

2024 was a record-breaking year for the overall number of Microsoft vulnerabilities. With 1,360 in total, Microsoft smashed the previous high of 1,292 in 2022. While this 11% increase is broadly in line with the 5-year trend-line, we had hoped to see these numbers dip, rather than bounce back up. When it comes to an ecosystem as broad as Microsoft’s, that is easier said than done, though.

If we take the long view over the 12-year span of this report, we can see the overall number of vulnerabilities—while rising—isn’t experiencing the rapid increases of the years prior to 2020.

As with prior years, Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Elevation of Privilege (EoP) continue to be the dominant vulnerability categories. While most other categories remain fairly stable, the number of Security Feature Bypass vulnerabilities increased 60% year-over-year, from 56 in 2023, to 90 in 2024.

Microsoft’s critical vulnerabilities, which provide an excellent barometer for real-world risk, have largely remained on their downward trajectory across the Microsoft ecosystem. However, that trend does not hold true with Microsoft Edge, where critical vulnerabilities sprung up to nine in 2024, from a low of zero in 2022. While this is still far better than the historical browser trends, we had hoped the browser security improvements in recent years had relegated this issue as a thing of the past.

### Data Highlights

- Total vulnerabilities rose to 1,360 in 2024—a record high since the report began
- Continuing the emerging trend in post-pandemic years, the Elevation of Privilege category accounted for a massive 40% (554) of the total vulnerabilities last year
- Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365 vulnerabilities plateaued in 2024
- Microsoft
