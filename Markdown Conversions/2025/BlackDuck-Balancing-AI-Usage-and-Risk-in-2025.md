## NAVIGATING SPEED, FRICTION, AND AI IN DEVSECOPS

The goal of DevSecOps has always been to ensure that speed and safety are on equal footing. Black Duck’s latest research reveals that although many organizations have successfully built high-velocity development pipelines, security automation lags far behind.

Our research also shows that a proliferation of security tools intended to identify and manage risk has created the opposite effect: a climate where DevOps teams are overwhelmed by noisy, unhelpful results.

The most transformative challenge facing DevSecOps is artificial intelligence. Our research found that AI is simultaneously perceived as the most promising tool for embedding security directly into coding and a dangerous source of risk.

This report provides a data-driven deep dive into all three of those challenges for DevSecOps teams: the ongoing tension between development speed and security, the “tool sprawl” crisis, and the double-edged risk/reward sword that is AI.

IT’S TIME TO STOP BUYING MORE TOOLS AND START OPTIMIZING THE ONES YOU HAVE

### Why You Should Read This Report

This report is a strategic analysis of the forces that are shaping how software is built and secured. We’ve tailored the data and insights for the people who define the strategy as well as for those who must execute it.

Our findings validate the constant battle you fight between speed and security. It gives you the data to start making a business case for the integrated, developer-focused tools and processes you need. Use this data to benchmark your team, understand the essential new skills in an AI-driven world, and get support for the strategic changes required to build secure software.

#### For Executive Leaders

This report is about business risk, investment efficiency, and competitive advantages. Our findings on toolchain inefficiency give you a clear way to evaluate the ROI of your security spending. Our research shows that it’s time to stop buying more tools and start optimizing the ones you have.

Our analysis uncovered an AI confidence paradox and shows that the explosion of “shadow AI” is a growing category of unmanaged business risk. For all its promises, unmanaged AI can also be a threat to your IP and your compliance posture that demands a comprehensive governance strategy.

Bottom line: This report gives you the data you need to align your security investments with real business outcomes and build a faster, more resilient organization.

#### For DevSecOps Professionals

This report is about your daily reality. We measured and quantified the friction you feel every day, from the soul-crushing drag of “tool noise” to the “alert fatigue” that’s making you ignore the false positive warnings from the security tools that should be helping you.

### Survey Methodology

The analysis in this report is grounded in a comprehensive survey of more than 1,000 global software and security professionals conducted by the international market research firm Censuswide in July and August 2025. Throughout the report, data points are cited using the marker [Q#] to refer to the specific question in our 15-question survey. The full list of questions can be found in Appendix A.

Our respondent base was designed to provide a holistic view of the DevSecOps ecosystem.

*   Geographies: Respondents were drawn from key technology hubs across North America, Europe, and Asia, including the U.K., U.S., Singapore, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, and China.

*   Roles: The survey captured perspectives across the entire organizational chart, from hands-on developers, DevOps engineers, and security architects to senior leadership, including CISOs and directors of security.

*   Companies: Participants represented organizations of all sizes, from startups to global enterprises with over 100,000 employees, across all major industry verticals, including Technology, Banking/Financial/Insurance, Manufacturing, and Government.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: KEY FINDINGS

For senior leadership, the message from our data is clear: The demand for speed, the complexity of your toolchain, and the disruptive force of AI have changed the game. Your ability to navigate these new realities will be the single biggest factor determining your risk posture, your capacity to innovate, and your competitive position.

Here are the six most critical findings from our global survey of more than 1,000 professionals. These findings represent the biggest challenges—and opportunities—in DevSecOps today.

You’re Shipping Fast, but You’re Building on Sand.
You’ve achieved incredible speed, with nearly 60% of organizations deploying code daily or even more often [Q1]. But that speed is built on a fragile foundation. Security practices are dangerously immature, with 45.56% of companies still relying on manual processes to get new code into the security testing queue [Q2]. This automation gap means many businesses are simply unaware of their vulnerabilities, with 61.64% of organizations testing less than 60% of their own applications [Q3]. The result is that you’re accumulating a massive security debt with every single release.

The “Tool Sprawl” Crisis.
If your organization brought in a multitude of application security testing (AST) tools to deal with a complex threat landscape, you’ve likely found that the strategy has had unintended consequences. Over 71% of our respondents say a significant chunk of their security alerts is just “noise”—false positives or duplicate findings from different tools [Q5]. This flood of useless information is destroying the ROI of your security investments.

QUESTIONS

Q1. On average, how often does your primary team/organization deploy code changes to production for your primary or business-critical application(s)?

Q2. What is the PRIMARY mechanism used to ensure new code sources (e.g., projects, repositories, significant feature branches) are included in your organization’s application security testing program?

Q3. Approximately what percentage of your projects, branches, and repositories are being included in your application security testing queue?

Q5. Approximately what percentage of security test results are noise? For example: duplicative results, false positives, conflicting with other tests/tools.

BLACKDUCK.COM | 4

Security Is Still a Speed Bump.
The operational drag from all that tool noise is the main reason over 81% of DevSecOps professionals say that security testing slows down development [Q6]. This issue creates a toxic tension between development and security teams and actively undermines the entire point of DevSecOps.

THE FUTURE MUST BE ABOUT EMBEDDING SECURITY SEAMLESSLY INTO THE WAY DEVELOPERS ALREADY WORK

AI Is a Double-Edged Sword.
AI is the most disruptive force in development, but the jury is still out if it’s a friend or a foe. A clear majority (56.55%) of our respondents find that it introduces novel security risks [Q8]. At the same time, an even bigger majority (63.33%) believe it’s helping them write more-secure code [Q11]. This apparent paradox makes AI governance a high-stakes balancing act that most companies are still trying to master.

Overconfident and Underprepared.
There appears to be a massive disconnect between promised capabilities and reality when it comes to AI. Despite admitting that their existing tools are noisy and have huge coverage gaps, 88.81% of our respondents say their organizations are confident that they can handle the new, more complex risks introduced by AI [Q9].

The Unifying Priority Is Development Workflow Integration.
Our survey shows that the problem isn’t necessarily the tools themselves, but the painful way developers are forced to use them. When we asked our respondents for their single most important priority for improving their application security testing capabilities, the answer was decisive. It wasn’t a new tool or more coverage. The #1 priority is “better development workflow integration” (27.27%) [Q15]. The future must be about embedding security seamlessly into the way developers already work.

QUESTIONS

Q6. Which statement best describes the relationship between application security testing and software development/delivery?

Q8. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “The use of AI coding assistants has introduced new security risks into, or made it harder to detect issues within, our codebase.”

Q9. How confident are you that you have the processes and tools in place to address security issues introduced by AI code generators/coding assistants?

Q11. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “The use of AI coding assistants has tangibly improved our ability to write more-secure code and more effectively address security risks within our DevSecOps life cycle (shift left).”

Q15. What is your organization’s SINGLE MOST important priority for improving its application security testing capabilities in the next 12 months?

## “SEC” LAGS BEHIND “DEV” AND “OPS”

The central problem in DevSecOps today is lopsided maturity. Most organizations in our survey have seemingly mastered the “Dev” and “Ops” parts of the equation. But the “Sec” part is still lagging far behind, stuck with manual processes and incomplete coverage. This has created a fragile system where the speed of development is constantly outrunning security’s ability to keep up. The result? Growing risk.

### Velocity as the New Standard

Shipping fast is no longer an aspiration; it’s the standard. A clear majority of companies, 59.74%, are now pushing new code to production for their critical applications every single day, or even multiple times a day [Q1].

You would expect that organizations releasing more frequently would also be using automation to detect and add code to the AST queue. Our data shows the converse is true: a heavy prevalence of fully/primarily manual means of detecting and adding projects to the test queue (Figure 1).

Notably, of those shipping code multiple times per day, 47.48% use primarily or fully manual mechanisms for adding projects to security testing queues (compared to 36.33% favoring automation) [Q1, Q2]. This skew toward manual practices is also evident for those releasing daily and weekly.

### The Automation Maturity Gap

The data is clear: CI/CD is the engine that runs modern software development. But that high-speed engine is bolted to an insecure chassis. Our data shows that security practices are dangerously immature in many organizations.

*   Manual by Default: For nearly half of all organizations (45.56%), security is still a manual process. The critical first step—getting new code into a security testing program—often depends on someone doing it by hand [Q2].

*   A Concerning Coverage Failure: Over 61% of respondents admit that their companies are testing 60% or less of their application portfolio [Q3]. This means, for most organizations, a huge—and largely unknown—portion of their software is going out the door without proper security vetting. This is the hidden security debt of the DevOps era, and it’s getting bigger with every release.

Q3. Approximately what percentage of your projects, branches, and repositories are being included in your application security testing queue?

More Tools, More Problems
To keep up with threats, companies have been throwing tools at the problem. A diverse arsenal of AST solutions was supposed to create a layered defense. But this strategy backfired. Instead of a safety net, our modern toolchain has become a primary source of friction, noise, and inefficiency that actively works against that goal.

Fully automated: Standard new sources are automatically discovered and configured for testing within routine manual steps

Primarily automated: Relies mostly on tools automatically detecting or integrating new sources, with some manual handling for exceptions or specific cases

Balanced mix: Significant use of both manual processes and automated discovery/onboarding

Primarily manual: Mostly manual processes, although some minor automation might assist

Fully manual: Relies entirely on manual declaration or selection by teams (Dev or Sec)

BLACKDUCK.COM | 6

### Mapping the AST Ecosystem

Today’s application security landscape is defined by tool sprawl. No single technology dominates. Instead, everyone has a portfolio of tools. The top five most common tool types are all used in nearly equal proportion [Q4].

### Drowning in False Positives

The single biggest problem created by a fragmented toolchain is the overwhelming volume of noise, duplicate results from different tools, and conflicting findings that leave developers in the dark about real threats to their code.

Each of these disconnected systems comes with its own overhead, its own APIs, and its own alert formats, creating a fragmented mess that DevOps teams must navigate every day.

The scale of this problem is staggering. A combined 71.63% of all respondents say that a significant portion—between 21% and 60%—of their security alerts are basically useless [Q5].

Figure 2. No dominant player: Everyone has a portfolio of disconnected tools.

When most alerts are junk, you’re forced to waste time on the low-value, soul-crushing work of triage. This leads directly to alert fatigue, where developers start ignoring all the warnings, making it a matter of when, not if, a critical alert gets lost in the noise.

### The Persistent “Speed vs. Security” Dilemma

Operational drag from tool sprawl and noise, combined with a reliance on manual processes, has a direct, measurable impact on the main goal of DevOps: speed. An overwhelming 81.22% of professionals say that application security testing slows down their development and delivery life cycle [Q6].

Forty-nine percent of respondents who rely entirely on manual processes feel application security testing severely slows down development and delivery (Figure 3). In contrast, 32% to 35% of those who say security testing does not slow development are fully or primarily automated.

For organizations relying heavily on manual processes, the promise of secure, high-velocity DevOps is still unfulfilled. The “Sec” part of DevSecOps is seen as a roadblock, not an enabler. It’s a vicious cycle: You buy more tools, which create more noise, which require more manual triage, which makes developers see security as a speed bump, which makes them resist the very security practices DevSecOps is trying to encourage.

## AI DISRUPTION: A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD

AI-powered coding assistants and open source AI models are now deeply embedded in the daily life of developers, and our data reveals a huge paradox around its usage. We’ve found that AI is seen as both a powerful new way to improve security and a significant new source of complex, scalable risk. Figuring out how to navigate the dual nature of AI is the central strategic challenge of every security leader in this new world.

QUESTIONS

Q7. On average, how frequently do you or your team utilize AI coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q, Gemini Code Assist, Tabnine) during software development?

Q8. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “The use of AI coding assistants has introduced new security risks into, or made it harder to detect issues within, our codebase.”

Q10. What is your organization’s PRIMARY security-related concern regarding the implications of using AI code generators/coding assistants?

Q11. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “The use of AI coding assistants has tangibly improved our ability to write more-secure code and more effectively address security risks within our DevSecOps life cycle (shift left).”

Q14. Are you using any open source AI models (e.g., from Hugging Face) in the software you build?

### Widespread Adoption of AI and Shadow AI

AI adoption has been less of a curve and more of a vertical line, a fundamental shift in how software gets made.

*   Deep Integration: A combined 43.66% of professionals are now using AI coding assistants frequently or constantly, deeply integrating AI into their daily work [Q7].

*   Pervasive Use of Open Source AI Models: The use of open source AI models from communities like Hugging Face is even more widespread. Nearly 97% of organizations are using these models in the software they build [Q14].

*   The Shadow AI Problem: AI was adopted so quickly that governance hasn’t had a chance to catch up. Our data shows a significant shadow AI problem. A notable 10.69% of respondents admit to using AI coding assistants without official permission, in an unverified or unmonitored way [Q7]. Developers are grabbing whatever tools they can to be more productive, and by doing so, they are exposing their companies to a whole new world of unmanaged security and compliance risk.

AI IS SEEN AS BOTH A POWERFUL NEW WAY TO IMPROVE SECURITY AND A SIGNIFICANT NEW SOURCE OF COMPLEX, SCALABLE RISK

BLACKDUCK.COM | 9

### Risk vs. Security

Most organizations are holding two completely contradictory ideas about AI simultaneously.

*   A New Threat Vector: There’s a clear consensus that AI is a new and serious threat. A majority of respondents (56.55%) agree that “the use of AI coding assistants has introduced new security risks” [Q8]. They’re worried about real, practical things: the scale and speed of new vulnerabilities, compliance nightmares, and the risk of their proprietary code ending up in a training model [Q10].

*   A Force Multiplier for Security: At the same time, there’s an even stronger belief that AI can be a powerful ally. A significant majority—63.33%—of DevSecOps professionals agree that AI has “tangibly improved our ability to write more-secure code” [Q11]. They see the benefits in faster vulnerability identification, better coding consistency, and quicker fixes.

### A Dangerous Disconnect?

We asked respondents how confident they were in their organization’s ability to manage risks introduced by AI coding assistants like Copilot, Claude Code, and ChatGPT. Despite many respondents admitting that their current toolchains are manual, have low coverage, and are incredibly noisy, an overwhelming 88.81% of respondents feel confident that they can handle the new and complex security issues introduced by AI coding assistants [Q9]. An even higher number—93.90%—are confident they can manage the open source license risks from AI-generated code, a notoriously difficult problem that many security tools can’t even see [Q13].

Organizations that use AI frequently or constantly have very high confidence in their ability to secure it. And many organizations feel that AI has aided them with secure coding. This implies two possibilities (as shown in Figure 4).

*   Higher confidence in one’s ability to secure AI results in more frequent use of AI assistants

*   Frequently benefiting from AI’s new security capabilities increases confidence in AppSec as a whole

The security benefits of AI are already being experienced early in the pipeline, with 19.78% of respondents noting that AI is producing faster identification/suggestion of potential security vulnerabilities in code as it’s written [Q12].

QUESTIONS

Q9. How confident are you that you have the processes and tools in place to address security issues introduced by AI code generators/coding assistants?

Q12. From the list below, what is the PRIMARY security-related benefit your team has experienced from using AI code generators/coding assistants?

## RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTLOOK

Our survey data shows a strong consensus on where DevSecOps professionals need to focus, and it signals a fundamental shift in how to think about application security.

### The Mandate for Workflow Integration

We asked our survey participants to name their single most important priority for improving application security in the next 12 months. The answer was loud and clear. The top priority, chosen by 27.27% of all respondents, is “better development workflow integration” [Q15].

This response beat out every other answer, including “increasing speed of tests” and “expanding coverage.” This means our survey respondents have correctly diagnosed the root cause of their pain. The problem isn’t a lack of tools, it’s the inefficient and painful way developers are forced to interact with those tools. This is a mandate for a new, developer-centric approach to make security a seamless, invisible, and valuable part of the developer’s native workflow.

### Actionable Recommendations

#### For Technical Leaders (CISOs, Directors)

*   Establish a Robust AI Governance Framework: The AI confidence paradox and the shadow AI problem are clear and present dangers to your organization. You need a formal AI governance framework, and you need it now. You must have clear policies on what’s allowed, address the top concerns of data privacy and IP protection, and establish who is accountable for the code AI produces.

QUESTION

Q15. What is your organization’s SINGLE MOST important priority for improving its application security testing capabilities in the next 12 months?

*   Rationalize and Optimize the AST Toolchain: Do a ruthless audit of your current security portfolio to find the redundancies and the main sources of noise. The goal is to consolidate around solutions that integrate into existing, AI-enabled build pipelines and give you (and developers) high-fidelity results faster. This is how you improve the ROI of your security spend and reduce the friction that’s killing your development velocity.

*   Invest in the Developer Experience of Security: Shift from buying standalone security boxes to investing in platforms and tools that are built for deep, native integration into developer workflows. Start measuring success not just with security metrics, but with developer-centric metrics like mean time to remediate.

#### For Hands-on Practitioners (Developers, DevOps Engineers, Security Architects)

*   Champion Integrated Tooling: You’re the one who will need to sprint to the finish line or risk missing a release deadline because of a failed late-stage security test. Be the person who demands security tools that live where you live—in the IDE and the CI/CD pipeline. And ideally, those tools should be developer-focused and support security rather than having to be force-fitted into dev workflows. Use the data in this report to prove to management that this is what the entire DevOps community is demanding.

DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW INTEGRATION”

THIS IS A MANDATE FOR A NEW, DEVELOPER-CENTRIC APPROACH TO MAKE SECURITY A SEAMLESS, INVISIBLE, AND VALUABLE PART OF THE DEVELOPER’S NATIVE WORKFLOW

BLACKDUCK.COM | 11

*   Quantify the Cost of Noise: You’re the one suffering from alert fatigue. Start tracking the time your team wastes by triaging useless alerts. Use our data—which found that over 71% of your peers report significant noise [Q5]—to show that this is a massive productivity drain on your own organization. A data-backed business case is the best way to get your toolchain rationalized.

*   Lead the Charge on Secure AI Enablement: You’re the one on the front lines of AI disruption. Don’t let it be defined only as a risk. Champion AI’s benefits, like faster vulnerability identification and quicker remediation. Show how it can be a security force multiplier, eliminating risks before they get tossed to AppSec teams, lessening their backlog with each commit. Work with your leadership to build the guardrails that will let you and your team innovate safely.

QUESTION

Q5. Approximately what percentage of security test results are noise? For example: duplicative results, false positives, conflicting with other tests/tools.

### Future Outlook

The trends we’ve identified are only going to accelerate. Based on this data, here are three predictions for the next 18 to 24 months.

*   The Acceleration of AI Governance Tools: The market abhors a vacuum. The combination of massive amounts of unsanctioned AI adoption and the risks of IP leakage and security flaws has created a critical need. Expect a flood of new tools and features designed specifically to give you visibility, governance, and security for AI-generated code and the use of open source AI models.

*   A Widening Developer-Centric Skills Gap: The industry’s demand for better workflow integration is going to separate the winners from the losers. Security pros who can think and act like developers—who understand APIs, IDEs, and CI/CD—will be invaluable. And developers who can effectively use security feedback inside their native workflows will be the ones who get to work on the most interesting projects and avoid being supplanted by AI coding agents.

EXPECT A FLOOD OF NEW TOOLS AND FEATURES DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO GIVE YOU VISIBILITY, GOVERNANCE, AND SECURITY FOR AI-GENERATED CODE

*   The Shift from Tool Acquisition to Toolchain Optimization: The pain from the toolchain inefficiency cycle is becoming noticeable to the C-suite. We predict a major shift in security budgets. The smart money will move away from buying more standalone point solutions and toward investing in application security posture management platforms that can ingest, deduplicate, and correlate findings from all your tools into a single, actionable view of risk.

## HOW BLACK DUCK CAN HELP

The story this report tells is clear and urgent: The old way of doing application security hasn’t kept up with the current reality of software development. The security debt from lopsided DevSecOps maturity, the wasted money from toolchain friction, and the unmanaged risks from the AI gold rush are interconnected, systemic business risks that threaten your IP, create massive legal exposure, and slow down your ability to innovate.

To navigate this new world, you must make a strategic shift. The old approach of buying another disconnected point solution every time a new threat emerges has created a cycle of inefficiency and noise. Moreover, each new tool represents an additional point of failure, potentially breaking pipelines and causing inconsistent enforcement of internal standards or external regulations. The best way forward is to move from a reactive, tool-centric model to a proactive, platform-based strategy.

The goal is to turn security from a bottleneck into a strategic enabler of speed and trust. You won’t do that by adding more tools. You do it by investing in enterprise-level visibility, comprehensive governance, and intelligent automation that is baked directly into the developer workflow. The companies that can accurately measure their security postures, enforce consistent policies across their entire toolchain, and safely govern the use of game-changing technologies like AI will be the companies that will win.

Black Duck provides the versatile, platform-based approach you need to manage risk at the speed and scale that modern, AI-enabled development demands. Here’s how our integrated solutions directly solve the core problems identified in this report, helping you turn insight into action, and systemic risk into a durable competitive advantage.

### From Security Debt to Security Assurance

The central theme of this report is that DevSecOps maturity is dangerously uneven in many organizations. They may have mastered “Dev” and “Ops” to get the speed they need, but their “Sec” is stuck in the past, full of manual processes and huge coverage gaps. What remains is a fragile system where development speed outpaces security, leading to a massive, often invisible “security debt.”

Security debt—unaudited components and untested code—gets bigger with every release. The data shows the scale of the problem: a staggering 45.56% of organizations still rely on manual processes just to get new code into the security queue [Q2]. The result is a critical failure in test coverage, with over 61% of organizations testing 60% or less of their applications [Q3].

The solution isn’t to test more. In their current state, most AppSec initiatives will just accrue longer, noisier backlogs by implementing more tests. Integrating risk detection, prioritization, and remediation mechanisms throughout the pipeline is the only way to fix the underlying visibility and governance deficit.
