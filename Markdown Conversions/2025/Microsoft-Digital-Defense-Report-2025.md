Mobilizing for impact:
Cybersecurity leadership in a defining era

Amy Hogan-Burney
Corporate Vice President,
Customer Security & Trust

Igor Tsyganskiy
Corporate Vice President and
Chief Information Security Officer

We are living through a defining moment
in cybersecurity. As digital transformation
accelerates, supercharged by AI, cyber
threats increasingly challenge economic
stability and individual safety. Cyber
threats are rapidly evolving from technical
problems affecting business to events
impacting all aspects of our society.

The pace of change in the threat landscape has
pushed us to rethink traditional defenses. The growth
and adoption of AI by both defenders and threat
actors benefits both sides. AI in cybersecurity
is already creating new challenges for security
organizations as they rush to adapt systems,
understand new threats, and equip their people with
new knowledge to keep pace.

Cyber threats are also playing an increasingly
significant role in geopolitical conflicts and criminal
activities, creating both a wide and deep scope of
responsibility for defenders. AI will play a critical role
in helping security professionals productively address
the growing threat landscape, but as an industry
we must step into this new paradigm cautiously.
With the increased speed of an AI-centric world, the
impact of action–whether by security organizations,
criminal actors, or nation states–will have faster and
potentially greater second, third, or fourth-order
effects. It is imperative that defenders consider
these ripple effects as they implement new security
controls, share security research, fix new security
vulnerabilities, and collaborate with each other.

Adversaries, whether nation-states, criminal
syndicates, or commercial cyber mercenaries, are
leveraging emerging technologies to attack with
both greater volume and more precision than ever
before, often by exploiting the trust that underpins
our digital lives. International collaboration among
defenders will be critical to define new coordinated
defenses and set new international norms that
enforce consequences for cyberattacks targeting the
global critical infrastructure or essential services.

For security leaders, the imperative is clear:
cybersecurity must be a priority, embedded
into the fabric of organizational strategy and
addressed regularly as part of risk management.
Global partnerships across industry peers and even
competitors must be established to coordinate and
collaborate on defenses against common adversaries.
Traditional perimeter defenses are no longer
sufficient. Resilience must be designed into systems,
supply chains, processes, and governance. New types
of threats will emerge with increasing frequency;
being informed and prepared is critical.

What’s new in this year’s report

AI as both a defensive necessity and a target
We’re witnessing adversaries deploy generative AI
for a variety of activities, including scaling social
engineering, automating lateral movement, engaging
in vulnerability discovery, and even real-time evasion
of security controls. Autonomous malware and AI-
powered agents are now capable of adapting their
tactics on the fly, challenging defenders to move
beyond static detection and embrace behavior-
based, anticipatory defense.

At the same time, AI systems themselves have
become high-value targets, with adversaries amping
up use of methods like prompt injection and data
poisoning to attack both models and systems, which
could lead to unauthorized actions, data leaks, theft,
or reputational damage.

Introductory statement continued

Diverse vectors for initial access
In today’s world, campaigns rely on multi-stage
attack chains that mix tactics and techniques such as
social engineering and technical exploits. This year,
we saw the widespread adoption of “ClickFix,” a social
engineering technique that tricks users into executing
malicious code themselves, bypassing traditional
phishing protections. We also saw the incorporation
of new access methods like device code phishing by
both cybercriminal and nation-state actors.

The pervasive threat of infostealers
Increasingly, adversaries aren’t breaking in, they’re
logging in. In today’s specialized cybercrime
economy, access is essential, and infostealers are a
way for operators to collect credentials and tokens
for sale on the dark web. Follow-on activities by
the buyers of compromised credentials can include
ransomware, data exfiltration, and/or extortion.
Overall, this means that organizations that
experience an infostealer infection are at high risk of
future breaches.

Nation-state actors expanding operations
Geopolitical objectives continue to drive a surge
in state-sponsored cyber activity, with a notable
expansion in targeting the communications, research,
and academia sectors. These expansions are mostly
within expected scope and volume, and primarily
focused on using cyber espionage against typical
targets to complement traditional intelligence
operations. Building on a trend we first noted last
year, nation states continue to accelerate AI use to
evolve their cyber and influence operations, making
them more scalable, advanced, and targeted.

We urge you to read this report with a bias toward
action. It is not just a reflection of the challenges both
past and future; it is a call to mobilize, prepare, and
confront. Innovation, resilience, and partnership are
the pillars of a secure digital future. By embracing
these principles, we can navigate uncertainty and
build a world where technology empowers and
protects us against the rising tide of threats.

Top 10
recommendations
from this report

1. Manage cyber risk at the
boardroom level
Treat cybersecurity as a business risk on par with
financial or legal challenges. It is important that
corporate boards and CEOs understand the security
weaknesses of their organization. Track and report
metrics like multifactor authentication (MFA) coverage,
patch latency, incident counts, and incident response
time to develop a comprehensive understanding of
both your organization’s potential vulnerabilities and its
preparedness in the event of a cybersecurity incident.

2. Prioritize protecting identities
Since identity is the top attack vector, enforce
phishing-resistant multifactor authentication across
all accounts, including administrative accounts.

3. Invest in people, not just tools
Cybersecurity is a whole-of-organization effort.
Find ways to upskill your workforce and consider making
security part of performance reviews. Culture and
readiness—not just technology—are primary factors in
both an organization’s defenses and its resilience.

4. Defend your perimeter
A third of attackers use crude tactics as the easy path
into an organization’s exposed footprint, often looking
beyond what you deploy to the vendors and supply
chain you trust, including perimeter web-facing assets
(18%), external remote services (12%), and supply chains
(3%). Knowing the full scope of your perimeter, auditing
the accesses you grant to trusted partners, and patching
any exposed attack surface forces attackers to work
harder to be successful.

5. Know your weaknesses
and pre-plan for breach
Combine knowledge of the organization’s exposure
footprint with organizational risk awareness to develop
a proactive plan for responding to future breach.
Tie security controls to business risks in terms the board
can understand. Since a breach is a matter of when, not
if, develop, test, and practice your incident response
(IR) plan—including specific scenarios for ransomware
attacks, which remain one of the most disruptive and
costly threats to operations. How fast can you isolate a
system or revoke credentials?

6. Map and monitor cloud assets
Since the cloud is now a primary target for adversaries,
conduct an inventory on every cloud workload,
application programming interface (API), and identity
within the organization, and monitor for rogue virtual
machines, misconfigurations, and unauthorized access.
At the same time, work proactively to enforce app
governance, conditional access policies, and continuous
token monitoring.

7. Build and train for resiliency
If breaches are all but inevitable, resilience and
recovery become key. Backups must be tested,
isolated, and restorable, and organizations should
have clean rebuild procedures for identity systems
and cloud environments.

8. Participate in intelligence sharing
Cyber defense is a team, not individual, sport.
By sharing and receiving real-time threat data with
peers, industry groups, and government, we can make
it harder for cyber adversaries to achieve their goals.

9. Prepare for regulatory changes
It’s more important than ever for organizations to
align with emerging laws like the European Union
(EU) Cyber Resilience Act or United States (US)
critical infrastructure mandates, which may require
reporting cyber incidents within a certain timeframe
or Secure by Design practices. These regulations
reinforce the importance of timely incident reporting
and stronger internal oversight of an organization’s
cybersecurity practices.

10. Start AI and quantum
risk planning now
Stay ahead of emerging technologies. Understand
both the benefits and risks of AI use within an
organization and adjust your risk planning, attack
surface exposure, and threat models appropriately.
Prepare for a post-quantum cryptography (PQC)
world by taking the time to inventory where
encryption is used and create a plan to upgrade to
modern standards as they evolve.

Key
takeaways

What every leader needs to know
about today’s threat landscape

1. Phishing-resistant MFA is the gold
standard for security
No matter how much the cyber threat landscape
changes, multifactor authentication (MFA) still blocks
over 99% of unauthorized access attempts, making
it the single most important security measure an
organization can implement. Phishing-resistance
provides an even more secure solution.

Read more on p23

2. Adversaries are targeting identities
that enable access to data
Government organizations, information technology
(IT) companies, and research and academic institutions
were the most impacted by cyber threats this year.
Among other data they hold that might interest
adversaries, these organizations store vast amounts
of personally identifiable information (PII), whose theft
enables future attacks. Accessing organizational data
has become a primary objective for threat actors.
Government, NGO, and academic entities using legacy
systems or operating with small IT teams and limited
incident response capabilities should prioritize securing
data and identity-facing assets.

Read more on p17

3. Adversaries are using diverse—but
well-known—initial access routes
Incident response investigations found that 28% of
breaches were initiated through phishing or social
engineering, 18% were via unpatched web assets, and
12% leveraged exposed remote services. Not only
are adversaries heavily leveraging the ClickFix social
engineering method to deliver malware this year, but
threat actors are incorporating exploits for known
vulnerabilities faster than ever.

Read more on p13

8. Adversaries are already
using AI as a multiplier
Adversaries have begun implementing AI across a
range of malicious activities, including for automated
vulnerability discovery or phishing campaigns,
malware or deepfake generation, data analysis, and
to craft highly convincing fraudulent messages.

Read more on p52

9. Using AI can be both a benefit
and a vulnerability
AI is driving rapid, substantial change. While it offers
many benefits for organizations, particularly in cyber
defense, AI can be attacked as well. As organizations
implement the strengths of AI, they should also
manage the weaknesses and potential exposure of
sensitive data by protecting against threats like prompt
injection, malicious tool invocation, and training
data poisoning.

Read more on p52

10. Quantum computing could
challenge cybersecurity
Quantum computing has vast economic potential,
but if used by malicious actors, it could threaten the
encryption of sensitive data.

Read more on p57

4. Most attacks are for money,
not espionage
More than half of cyberattacks with known motives had
financial objectives such as extortion or ransom, while
only 4% were motivated solely by espionage.

Read more on p11

5. Data exfiltration is the norm
Regardless of adversary motivations, accessing
organizational data is now a primary goal for attacks.
In the past year, we observed data collection in 80% of
reactive engagements.

Read more on p29

6. Workload identities are
under threat
As organizations implement phishing-resistant MFA
and conditional access policies, adversaries are pivoting
to targeting identities and elevated privileges granted
to service-to-service workloads like apps, services, and
scripts that access cloud resources because service-
based workloads are often implemented with elevated
privileges but weak security controls.

Read more on p17

7. Adversaries are conducting
destructive attacks in the cloud
We have seen an 87% increase in campaigns aimed at
disrupting Azure cloud customer environments through
destructive actions such as ransomware or mass
deletion. Additionally, over 40% of ransomware attacks
now involve hybrid components.

IT and government bodies were the most impacted
by cyber threats this year, from national to local
entities. These organizations manage critical public
services—for example, healthcare, research and
academia, transportation, and public safety—and
store vast amounts of sensitive data, including
personally identifiable information (PII), tax records,
and voting information. Additionally, many local
governments operate on legacy systems that are
difficult to patch and secure, and budget constraints
and small IT teams often mean delayed updates,
minimal threat monitoring, and limited incident
response capabilities. This makes them high-value
targets for both nation-state actors and financially
motivated cybercriminals.

While attacks on IT, manufacturing, transportation,
finance, energy, and healthcare can have both digital
and physical consequences, attacks on industries
like research and academia and telecommunications
could additionally serve as a launchpad for attacks on
other entities.

Attacker motivations and goals range from stealing
sensitive information—such as personally identifiable

records—to disrupting business operations. The most
common actions observed post-compromise are
financially motivated extortion and ransomware
operations. In incidents where we were able to
determine threat actor objectives, we found that
33% involved extortion, while 19% used attempted
destructive or human-operated ransomware attacks.
We observed the deployment of a ransomware
payload in 8% of engagements. In contrast, threat
actors were motivated solely by espionage in only
4% of engagements. Notably, 7% of organizations
were impacted by infrastructure building. This means
threat actors might be taking advantage of
organizations’ unmanaged digital assets to stage
attacks against other third-party targets downstream.

A ransomware attack with potential global
impact stopped in under two minutes

FY24

FY25

In February 2025, the global economy narrowly
averted catastrophe after a global shipping
company experienced a ransomware attack.
Had the company’s systems been taken offline for
even a few hours, the cascading effect would have
impacted trade and industry around the world.
Prolonged downtime would have ground maritime
commerce to a crawl.

As daunting as today’s cyber threat landscape
feels, this is a success story—proof that investing
in cybersecurity pays off. Because the shipping
company committed to protecting its digital
assets, the attack was quickly stopped. The time
from observation to disruption was a mere
14 minutes, with encryption stopped one

How threat actors are shaping the cyber risk environment continued

While attack tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) continue to evolve at a rapid pace, over
the past year, attackers nevertheless persisted
in targeting well-known pain points, regardless
of targeted industry or attacker motivation.
According to our incident response engagements,
a significant portion of attacks begin by targeting
an organization’s exposure footprint: perimeter
web-facing assets (18%) and external remote
services (12%) as well as—to a lesser degree—
supply chains (3%).

Threat actors are incorporating exploits for known
vulnerabilities at a faster pace than before to target
misconfigured or vulnerable web-facing applications
and remote services. The rapid weaponization of
exploits has increasingly impacted the windows
between vulnerability disclosure, patch availability,
and patch deployment. Ransomware operators
and botnet distributors often choose targets of
opportunity, using scanning tools or services
to identify unpatched systems or copying the
successful publicized attacks of other threat actors.
Sophisticated threat actors are also targeting supply
chains and trusted third-party relationships, which
can affect downstream customers. By compromising
a less secure partner or vendor in the supply chain,
attackers could potentially impact more hardened
targets in multistage attacks.

Managing an organization’s footprint has
become increasingly complex due to difficulties in
understanding true exposure. Organizations can
guard the wrong assets, lack a complete picture of
their exposure, or struggle to address vulnerable
devices. For cloud environments in particular,
organizations might struggle to properly determine
who has what access within their cloud tenant
across the trust chain of software-as-a-service
(SaaS) applications, guest accounts, and delegated
privileges. This complexity is compounded by the
fragmented nature of many security measures, as
the lack of integration between security tools adds to
the complexity and creates potential blind spots for
attackers to exploit.

The abuse of valid accounts is also a frequently
observed technique (17%). This can be the result
of several types of attacks that maliciously gain
access to user credentials—for example, theft,
phishing, brute force, or social engineering—and
use them to infiltrate systems without triggering
traditional security alerts. As will be discussed
later in this report, Microsoft has seen attackers
acquiring stolen credentials on underground criminal
forums to sign in directly to networks. And in cloud
environments, we have identified multiple criminal
and nation-state actors conducting entire end-to-
end attacks as legitimate users or resources, with
the ability to manipulate any resource or process
that the compromised identity is trusted to access,
including email, other cloud services, or the on-
premises environment.

Logging in: Today’s playbook for
initial access

This year, Microsoft Defender Experts observed a
sharp change in how threat actors achieve initial
access. Campaigns are no longer dominated by
simple phishing and instead rely on multi-stage
attack chains that mix technical exploits, social
engineering, infrastructure abuse, and evasion
through legitimate platforms. Specific initial access
tactics observed include:

-   ClickFix, an approach in which users are tricked

into copying and pasting malicious code into their
systems themselves (discussed more on page 36).
-   Attacks combining email bombing, voice phishing
(vishing) calls, and Microsoft Teams impersonation
to convincingly pose as IT support and gain
remote access.

-   The deployment of rogue virtual machines using
the open-source Quick Emulator (QEMU), giving
attackers an isolated space to operate completely
out of sight from traditional security tools.
-   The exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in

commonly used tools like SimpleHelp, BeyondTrust,
Fortinet, Cleo, and Apache Tomcat.

-   Use of malvertising, especially where malware
is hosted on trusted platforms like GitHub and
Discord and delivered through deceptive ads on
high-traffic sites.

-   The deployment of commodity infostealers to

harvest credentials for future intrusions or resale by
access brokers (discussed more on page 24).

These trends reveal a key shift in attacker strategy.
Threat actors are no longer trying to force their
way in—they’re blending in. By abusing legitimate
tools, platforms,
