# AI Instruction Set for Converting Technical PDFs to Markdown

## Purpose
Ensure technical PDFs are converted to Markdown with complete fidelity, preserving all content, structure, and formatting.

## Goals
1. **Full Conversion**: Include all text, quotations, footnotes, references, and technical terminology without omission or summarization.  
2. **TOC Format**: Include a fully functional Table of Contents with proper linking.  
3. **Markdown Conventions**: Use clear, consistent, and professional formatting.  
4. **Images**: Describe image contents without embedding.

## Conversion Instructions
### Content
- **Include All Text**: Retain all sections, preserving the original structure and content.  
- **Headings**: Format with `#` for main headings, `##` and `###` for subheadings.  
- **Lists**: Use `1.` for ordered lists, `-` for unordered lists.  
- **Emphasis and Formatting**: Apply `_italic_`, `**bold**`, `>` for block quotes, and \`\`\` for code blocks.  
- **Links**: Format as `[text](URL)` and ensure accuracy.

### Images
- **Do Not Embed**: Replace with descriptive text: `![Image description]`.

### Table of Contents
- Place after the document title but before the main content:
  ## Table of Contents
  - [Section Title](#section-title)
  - [Subsection Title](#subsection-title)
- Ensure anchor links work and follow the format `(#section-title)`.

### Footnotes and References
- Use Markdown footnote syntax:  
  Content with a footnote[^1].  
  [^1]: Footnote content here.
- Retain all technical and academic terms exactly.

## Verification and Quality Assurance
1. **Accuracy**: Verify the entire document is converted without omissions.  
2. **TOC Functionality**: Check all links point to the correct headings.  
3. **Readability**: Ensure professional formatting and adherence to Markdown standards. DO NOT enclose the top and bottom of the content in ```markdown and ``` . 
4. **Fidelity**: Confirm the output matches the original PDF exactly.

At INTERPOL, we recognize that no

This assessment follows the 2024 African
Cyberthreat  Assessment  Report,  building
on  the  findings  from  last  year’s  report.  It
aims  to  provide  an  updated  perspective
on  the  cybersecurity  landscape  and  to
track the progress made in addressing the
challenges previously highlighted.

The  goal  of  this  report  is  to  support
law  enforcement,  policymakers,  and
cybersecurity  stakeholders  in  identifying
emerging  threats,  addressing  capability
gaps,  and  enhancing  cooperation  at
national  and  regional  levels.  Investigating
cybercrime at any level has direct impact
on  victims  and  potential  victims  located
across  the  globe.  Through  collective
efforts, Africa’s digital future will be more

With over 500 million Internet users in the

Many  countries  across  the  continent  face

literacy  gaps,
further exacerbating these risks.

The
INTERPOL  Africa  Cyberthreat
Assessment  Report  2025  highlights  a
sharp  increase  in  cybercrime  incidents
across  Africa.  Over
two-thirds  of
INTERPOL's  African  member  countries
surveyed have identified cyber-dependent
and  cyber-enabled  crimes  as  accounting
for  a  medium  to  high  share  of  all  crimes.
Notably,  cybercrime  accounts  for  more
than  30%  of  all  reported  crimes  in  both
Western  and  Eastern  Africa,  making  it  a
major concern in these subregions:

![Image description: Bar graph showing perceived cybercrime risk levels across African subregions as reported by INTERPOL Africa member countries in the 2025 Survey. The y-axis is labeled "Percentage (%)" and ranges from 0 to 100. The x-axis is labeled "Region" and includes North, Central, South, East, and West. Each region has three bars representing "Less than 10% of all crimes - Low," "Between 10-30% of all crimes - Medium," and "More than 30% of all crimes - High."]

Previous editions of the Report identified
trojans,
ransomware  attacks,  banking
stealers,  online  scams,  phishing,  business

software  offered  as  a  service,  such
as  spyware  and  phishing  kits,  as  the
most  prevalent  cyberthreats.[^7]  Online
scams,  particularly  phishing,  continue

to  be  the  most  frequently  reported
cybercrimes  among  INTERPOL  member
countries,  while  ransomware  and  BEC
remain  widespread.  In  addition,  digital
sextortion and identity theft are reported
as  significant  cyberthreats  by  African
member countries.

could indicate improved law enforcement
efforts,  better  cybersecurity  awareness,
or  a  shift  in  cybercriminal  tactics  toward
more  effective  methods  such  as  social
engineering and AI-driven scams.

Many INTERPOL member countries in the
African  region  have  reported  a  growing
financial  and  operational
impact  of
cybercrime,  with  online  scams,  Business
Email  Compromise  (BEC),  ransomware,

and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
attacks  identified  as  the  most  financially
damaging  threats  across  all  sub-regions.
Between  2019  and  2025,  cyber  incidents
across the continent resulted in estimated
financial
losses  exceeding  $3  billion[^8],
with  the  finance,  healthcare,  energy,
and  government  sectors  among  the
hardest  hit.[^9]  These  critical  industries  are
prime  targets  for  cybercriminals  who
create  operational  disruption  and  data
breaches  resulting  in  significant  financial
consequences.
