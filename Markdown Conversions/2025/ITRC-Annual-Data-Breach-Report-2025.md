# U.S. Data Breach Landscape in H1 2025
A Surge in Sophisticated Attacks and a Troubling Lack of Transparency

## Executive Summary

The first half (H1) of 2025 has witnessed a continued onslaught of data breaches in the United States, with a significant number of individuals affected and a continuing, concerning trend of ambiguity in breach notifications. Analysis of data from the first six months of the year reveals a landscape dominated by cyberattacks, with supply chain vulnerabilities persisting as a major threat vector. While the total number of compromises has not dramatically outpaced previous years, the impact on victims remains severe.

A total of 1,732 data compromises were reported in H1 2025, affecting 165,745,452 individuals. This represents a significant portion of the total compromises seen in the entirety of 2024, which stood at 3,155. Comparatively, H1 2025 compromises are at 54.9 percent (54.9%) of the full-year 2024 total.

The number of victim notices in H1 2025, however, is only 12.2 percent (12.2%) of the total for 2024, suggesting that while breaches remain frequent, the scale of mega-breaches affecting hundreds of millions seen in the previous year has not been repeated in the first half of this year.

This report represents two significant changes in the Identity Theft Resource Center’s (ITRC) data compromise reports. First, the ITRC is moving to a twice-a-year report schedule with this half-year report published in July and a full-year report in January. The ITRC will no longer publish Q1 and Q3 reports.

Second, the ITRC is introducing a new category of data compromise - Previously Compromised Data (PCD) - where data that was previously compromised is aggregated and recirculated by identity criminals. In some cases, data breach notices have been issued, but in others, there is no known source of the compromise and therefore, no known data breach notices linked to the data.

## Key Trends in H1 2025

### Cyberattacks Reign Supreme
The overwhelming majority of data breaches in H1 2025 were the result of cyberattacks, with 1,348 incidents reported, impacting 114,582,621 victims. This continues a long-standing trend of malicious actors being the primary cause of data compromises.

### The Supply Chain is a Critical Weakness
Supply chain attacks have proven to be a significant and growing threat. In the first half of the year, 79 such breaches were reported, affecting 690 entities and compromising the data of 78,320,240 individuals. This highlights the cascading effect that a single vulnerability in a third-party vendor can have on a multitude of organizations and their customers.

### Emerging Threats
The broader cybersecurity landscape in 2025 is marked by the continued rise of AI-powered phishing attacks, which are more sophisticated and harder to detect.

Also, the introduction repackaged and recirculated personal information - PCD - into the risk environment represents a significant new threat to organizations that are vulnerable to the use of stolen logins and passwords to gain access to mission critical systems for ransom attacks and/or data exfiltration. The recent discovery of an unsecured cloud environment with more than 16 billion logins and passwords aggregated into a single database is an example of PCD.

However, because PCD is previously compromised data, PCD does not represent an increased risk to individuals, but rather a continuing risk of a variety of identity crimes, including fraud and scams.

### A Continuing Lack of Detail in Beach Notifications
A troubling trend is the high number of data breach notices that lack specific information about the root cause of the incident. A staggering 1,191 notices, or 69 percent (69%) of the total, did not include an attack vector. This lack of transparency hinders a full understanding of the threat landscape and makes it difficult for individuals and other organizations to take appropriate protective measures.

### Financial and Healthcare Sectors Remain Prime Targets
The financial services and healthcare industries continue to be the most targeted sectors, with 387 and 283 compromises, respectively. While the number of compromises in financial services is slightly down from H1 2024, the healthcare sector saw an increase in breach events.

## H1 2025 vs. Full-Year 2024: A Comparative Look

| Category           | H1 2024        | FY 2024        | Percentage of FY 2024 |
| :----------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :-------------------- |
| Total Compromises  | 1,732          | 3,155          | 54.9%                 |
| Victim Notices     | 165,745,452    | 1,363,619,333  | 12.2%                 |
| Cyberattacks       | 1,348          | 2,527          | 53.3%                 |
| System & Human Error | 129            | 311            | 41.5%                 |
| Physical Attacks   | 34             | 33             | 103%                  |

The data indicates that, while the raw number of compromises in the first half of 2025 is on pace to be comparable to 2024, the number of individuals affected is significantly lower so far. The notable increase in the percentage of physical attacks compared to the full year of 2024, while smaller in absolute numbers, is a trend to monitor.

## Recommendations for Businesses to Prevent Data Breaches

In light of these trends, businesses should adopt an active and multi-layered security posture. Key recommendations include:

*   **Strengthen Supply Chain Security**: Conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party vendors and partners – an action mandated under some state privacy laws. Implement stringent access controls and continuously monitor their activities. Use a Third-Party service to verify previous cybersecurity and data breaches and alert organizations to new incidents.
*   **Enhance Employee Training**: With social engineering and phishing being primary attack vectors, regular and robust employee training on cybersecurity best practices is crucial. This includes recognizing sophisticated phishing attempts and understanding data handling policies.
*   **Implement Robust Access Controls**: Enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring employees only have access to the data and systems necessary for their roles. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be mandatory for all critical systems. Passkeys for internal and external use should be on development roadmaps.
*   **Maintain and Patch Systems**: Regularly update and patch all software and systems to address known vulnerabilities. This includes both internal systems and those used by third-party vendors.
*   **Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan**: Have a clear and well-rehearsed incident response plan in place to ensure a swift and effective reaction in the event of a breach.

## How Individuals Can Protect Themselves

For individuals whose personal information may have been compromised in a data breach, the following steps are recommended:

*   **Be Vigilant with Communications**: Phishing attempts often follow a data breach. Be wary of unsolicited emails, text messages or phone calls that ask for personal information.
*   **Monitor Financial Accounts**: Regularly review bank and credit card statements for any suspicious activity.
*   **Freeze Your Credit**: Placing a freeze on your credit with the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) and specialty Credit Reporting Agencies (LexisNexis, for example) can prevent unauthorized accounts from being opened in your name. Visit the ITRC’s freeze website – FrozenPii.com – to freeze your credit.
*   **Create Passkeys**: When offered the chance to create a Passkey, do it. Passkeys replace passwords and do not require you to remember anything to access your accounts or for the business where you have an account to store any information. That makes them much more secure than a password.
*   **Use Strong and Unique Passwords**: When you can’t use a Passkey, avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts. Utilize a password manager to create and store long passwords.
*   **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: If you have to use a password, be sure to enable MFA on all online accounts, especially for sensitive accounts like banking and email, whenever possible.

## Methodology Notes

For purposes of quarterly and annual reporting, the ITRC aggregates data events based on the date the breach, exposure or leak was entered into the database rather than the date the event occurred. This avoids the confusion and data conflicts associated with the need to routinely update previous reports and compromise totals. The date of the original compromise, if known, and the date of the event report are noted in the ITRC’s Breach Alert data compromise tracking database.

The number of victims linked to individual compromises are updated as needed and can be accessed in the ITRC’s Breach Alert breach tracking solution. The ITRC reports Third-Party/Supply Chain Attacks as a single attack against the company that lost control of the information. The total number of individuals impacted by third-party incidents is based on notices sent by the multiple organizations impacted by the single data compromise.

Unless otherwise noted, all data reported here was entered into the ITRC Breach Alert database between January 7, 2025, through June 30, 2025.
