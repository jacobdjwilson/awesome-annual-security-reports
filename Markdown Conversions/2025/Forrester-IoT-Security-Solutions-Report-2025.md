## Summary

In our evaluation of IoT security solutions providers, we identified the most significant ones and researched, analyzed, and scored them. This report shows how each provider measures up and helps you select the right one for your needs.

## IoT Security Solutions Are A Crucial Component Of Your Enterprise Security

Internet-of-things (IoT) devices are now part of every organization, no matter the industry, location, or size. Ranging from printers, motion sensors, and smart assistants to warehouse scanners, infusion pumps, and smart meters, these purpose-built devices are essential to daily operations. However, resource restrictions mean these connected devices often lack the same local security functions of standard endpoints — desktops, servers, mobile devices — and are more susceptible to being attacked and compromised. The Mirai botnet in 2016 exposed the vulnerability of certain IoT devices, and this led to vendors introducing solutions to identify the risks incumbent to these devices. The increasing rate of attacks and their evolving complexity highlight the need for security leaders to implement proper IoT security solutions to reduce the threats coming through these ubiquitous devices.

IoT security solutions customers using this evaluation to inform a purchase decision should consider:

*   **Asset discovery is crucial, but not the only critical capability.** You can’t protect what you don’t know is there, and for many businesses this means discovering and classifying hundreds of thousands to millions of devices across a global infrastructure. This task can take months to complete but is just one component of protecting your IoT environment. Staging your discovery project to uncover your critical assets first will allow you to move to evaluating communication paths and implementing proper segmentation, addressing vulnerabilities and risks within the uncovered devices before moving onto the next set of assets.
*   **Vulnerability management and risk posture management are not the same.** Vulnerability management focuses on identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities in IoT devices, including firmware and network services, whereas risk posture management assesses the overall security of the IoT ecosystem, including device trustworthiness, network segmentation, and operational context. Prioritize vulnerability management within your IoT security solution, especially if you have an enterprise risk posture management platform. Both functions improve infrastructure security and reduce the threats that come through your IoT devices.
*   **New IoT infrastructure policies must not introduce issues to operations.** From vulnerability mitigation to network segmentation, before a policy is deployed within your IoT environment, your analysts need to assess the impact of these changes, as they can have severe ramifications on your business processes. A printer being inaccessible can be annoying, but a bar code scanner in the warehouse unable to communicate with the order-processing application can delay shipping and miss customer SLAs. It’s important that your IoT security platform reviews your proposed policy changes to reduce operational issues.

## Contenders

### Xage Security

Xage Security started in 2016 with a distributed ledger security platform for industrial IoT (IIoT). It has expanded its solution to cover more devices and provide secure remote access, least privilege access, and secure data exchange.

*   **Strategy.** Xage’s vision is that discovery is not a prerequisite to protection — but we’d argue that if you don’t know the depths what you’re trying to protect, you can leave gaps in your security. Its innovation has been positive, but its roadmap merely aims to bring its offering up to par with others in this evaluation. Its customer adoption and support programs are solid, and its pricing and licensing flexibility are on par.
*   **Capabilities.** Xage’s key differentiator is its IAM functions for IoT devices, offering good control of encryption as well as strong network segmentation and threat defense. The only drawback is the need to deploy its Xage Extended Protection (XEP) appliances to support that segmentation functionality; others in this evaluation can support policy deployment across a wide range of vendors. Xage has some native device identification and classification functions, but it relies heavily on integrations to support these, leading to low-quality information for vulnerability assessments and risk posture management.
*   **Customer feedback.** Customers valued the overall architecture of the Xage solution and noted how easy it is to work with the vendor. While the broader network segmentation functions were just what they needed, they felt microsegmentation could be a challenge to deploy.
*   **Forrester’s take.** Xage Security is a good fit for enterprises that have already deployed asset discovery tools but lack a solution to handle IoT infrastructure protection.

This has its benefits for existing Check Point customers but may create obstacles to adoption for those that have adopted security solutions from other vendors. Its IoT security innovation is good, and it provides a solid partner community and quality support services.
*   **Capabilities.** Its network threat monitoring is on par, as are its IAM capabilities and encryption support functions. Device identification and classification do not provide the same asset details, automated classification, or the breadth of device coverage of others in this evaluation without the integration of external solutions; this leads to deficits in how it natively handles vulnerability assessments and risk posture management.
*   **Customer feedback.** Customers appreciated the relationship they have with Check Point and the solution’s integration into Check Point’s broader cybersecurity platform. Only one of Check Point’s reference customers responded to Forrester’s outreach for this evaluation.
*   **Forrester’s take.** Check Point’s IoT Protect suits existing Check Point customers that need to protect their IoT assets.

View Check Point Software Technologies’ detailed scorecard.

### Microsoft

Microsoft acquired CyberX in 2020 to expand its cybersecurity offerings to IoT and OT devices. Microsoft sees that these devices are not just challenges for specific verticals but also part of enterprise infrastructures across a wide array of markets.

*   **Strategy.** While called Defender for IoT, Microsoft’s solution focuses primarily and heavily on supporting OT and industrial IoT devices. Microsoft offers services for other IoT devices that are common among all enterprises but not to the depth of other vendors in this evaluation. Its partner ecosystem and adoption focus in the IoT space is on par with its rivals, while its pricing model is a cost-effective add-on to a Microsoft 365 E5 license, which can benefit many customers.
*   **Capabilities.** Because the solution leans more toward supporting OT and industrial IoT devices, its enterprise IoT device support for key capabilities like asset discovery, vulnerability assessment and resolution, or network segmentation lag others in this evaluation. Microsoft also relies on other vendors to provide network threat monitoring. The Microsoft platform has good overall risk posture management and device configuration monitoring.
*   **Customer feedback.** Customers appreciated that the offering integrates easily into their existing Microsoft 365 cybersecurity infrastructure and doesn’t require a significant learning curve for effective use. Microsoft did not provide reference customers for this evaluation.
*   **Forrester’s take.** Microsoft’s Defender for IoT is a good option for existing Microsoft E5 customers who are looking for an easy platform with which to begin their IoT security journey.

## Supplemental Material

### The Forrester Wave Methodology

A Forrester Wave is a guide for buyers considering their purchasing options in a technology marketplace. To offer an equitable process for all participants, Forrester follows The Forrester Wave™ Methodology to evaluate participating vendors.

In our review, we conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors to consider for the evaluation. From that initial pool of vendors, we narrow our final list based on the inclusion criteria. We then gather details of product and strategy through a detailed questionnaire, demos and briefings, and interviews with customers (vendors may provide up to three reference customers; we also consider feedback from other customers we’ve spoken with). We use those inputs, along with the analyst’s experience and expertise in the marketplace, to score vendors, using a relative rating system that compares each vendor against the others in the evaluation.

We include the publishing date (quarter and year) clearly in the title of each Forrester Wave report. We evaluated the vendors participating in this Forrester Wave using materials they provided to us by July 1, 2025, and did not allow additional information after that point. We encourage readers to evaluate how the market and vendor offerings change over time.

In accordance with our vendor review policy, Forrester asks vendors to review our findings prior to publishing to check for accuracy. We score vendors that met our defined inclusion criteria but declined to participate in or contributed only partially to the evaluation in accordance with our vendor participation policy and publish their positioning along with those of the participating vendors. Microsoft declined to participate in the full Forrester Wave evaluation process. For vendors that are not full participants, Forrester uses primary and secondary research in its analysis. For example, we might use public information, data gathered via briefings, and independently sourced customer interviews to score the vendor. We may ask the vendor for an abbreviated briefing and/or to provide reference customers. We may also rely on estimates to score vendors.
