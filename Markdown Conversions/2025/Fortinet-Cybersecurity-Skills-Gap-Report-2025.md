## INTRODUCTION
### A Growing Need to Manage Risk

Organizations are operating in a new cybersecurity ”normal” where breaches are inevitable, AI is a real and present danger, and knowledge gaps are a critical liability. It’s no longer enough to try to simply mitigate risk: Organizations need to find ways to manage risk proactively on an ongoing basis.

The vast majority (86%) of this year’s Cybersecurity Skills Gap survey respondents say they had one or more breaches in 2024, with nearly one-third (28%) reporting five or more. Those levels are in line with the last couple of years—and are up notably from our first survey in 2021 (at 80% and 19% respectively), suggesting a trend that is here to stay.

The impact of those security incidents is significant. More than half (52%) of organizations surveyed say breaches cost them more than $1 million. This is roughly in line with last year’s 53% and up from 38% in 2021.

In response, organizations are turning increasingly to AI to strengthen their capabilities and posture, even as they acknowledge AI could also be used against them as an engine of new or improved cyberattacks. The majority (80%) say AI tools are helping their IT and security teams be more effective—though almost all are aware that AI won’t solve the ongoing skills shortage alone.

That shortage amounts to a deficit of more than 4.7 million cybersecurity professionals, according to the 2024 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. The lack of skilled personnel leaves organizations more vulnerable to attacks, and governments are taking note. Many countries have made cybersecurity a national priority and have launched initiatives to grow the cyber workforce and make it more resilient.

Closing the gap requires a coordinated strategy built on three pillars: increased awareness and education, targeted training and certification, and the implementation of advanced security technologies. Organizations need to rethink the qualifications they seek in candidates, pursue multiple pathways to expertise, and continue to tap into underutilized talent pools.

Organizations must also invest in cybersecurity training and development. The decline this year in willingness to pay for certifications—down to 73% from 89% the previous year—is concerning in this regard. If this turns out to be an emerging trend, organizations should review this decision as part of their risk management strategy.

Skilled and aware employees and cybersecurity professionals are crucial to overall cyber risk management in a world that is moved beyond the attack-and-defend cycle. Today, to protect themselves, organizations need to maintain a posture of perpetual vigilance and continuous risk awareness.

![Quote: 49% of all respondents are concerned that AI will increase cyberattacks.]

## AI Is Seen as a Threat, an Opportunity, and a Challenge

While organizations have concerns about AI-related risks, they also see AI as a potentially powerful tool for shoring up defenses—though it is a tool that must be managed by skilled professionals. The vast majority (97%) of this year’s respondents are either already using or planning to implement AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions.

The primary concern surrounding AI is its potential to drive an increase in cyberattacks (49%). This reflects growing unease about how AI can be leveraged by threat actors to develop more sophisticated, automated, and targeted attacks. Following that, a cluster of concerns emerges with similar levels of urgency: 
- 39% worry about the spread of misinformation.
- 38% cite surveillance and privacy violations.
- 37% express fears about the development of superintelligent AI and the broader risk of losing control.

Concern about AI-enabled cyberattacks may be contributing to the adoption of AI-powered cybersecurity solutions—which 65% of respondents have already implemented, and another 32% plan to implement in the next year. Just 2% say they have no plans to implement such tools.

The more attacks an organization has incurred, the more likely it is to have AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions in place. Roughly three quarters (76%) of organizations that experienced nine or more cyberattacks in 2024 say they had AI cybersecurity tools deployed.

Asked what they foresee as the biggest challenge to integrating AI into cybersecurity, 48% of IT decision makers point to a lack of staff with sufficient AI expertise. The ability to ensure data privacy and information security was a close second at 47%.

## Conclusion

Cybersecurity has become an increasingly strategic concern, shaped by the rise of AI and the comprehensive array of risks that cyberthreats pose to a business. The need for a strategic approach is pushing cybersecurity past the C-suite all the way up to the board level.

As boards take on more responsibility, corporate directors are under pressure to understand the issues. AI simultaneously poses risks and has tremendous potential to enhance solutions. Organizations need to ensure all people are “AI aware” and that teams have the skills to work with AI tools.

The ongoing global cybersecurity skills shortage remains a problem. Organizations can maximize opportunities by shifting expectations about credentials and accessing underutilized pools of talent. Closing the gap requires investment in training and development. The reluctance to pay for certifications turned up in this year’s results may seriously undermine cybersecurity objectives.

Fortinet has embraced a three-pronged approach—awareness, training, and technology—which fits within the larger framework of holistic cyber risk management.
