### INTRODUCTION
#### A Growing Need to Manage Risk
Organizations are operating in a new cybersecurity ”normal” where breaches are inevitable, AI is a real and present danger, and knowledge gaps are a critical liability. It’s no longer enough to try to simply mitigate risk: Organizations need to find ways to manage risk proactively on an ongoing basis.

That shortage amounts to a deficit of more than 4.7 million cybersecurity professionals, according to the 2024 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. The lack of skilled personnel leaves organizations more vulnerable to attacks, and governments are taking note. Many countries have made cybersecurity a national priority and have launched initiatives to grow the cyber workforce and make it more resilient.

Closing the gap requires a coordinated strategy built on three pillars: increased awareness and education, targeted training and certification, and the implementation of advanced security technologies. Organizations need to rethink the qualifications they seek in candidates, pursue multiple pathways to expertise, and continue to tap into underutilized talent pools.

The vast majority (86%) of this year’s Cybersecurity Skills Gap survey respondents say they had one or more breaches in 2024, with nearly one-third (28%) reporting five or more. Those levels are in line with the last couple of years—and are up notably from our first survey in 2021 (at 80% and 19% respectively), suggesting a trend that is here to stay.

Organizations must also invest in cybersecurity training and development. The decline this year in willingness to pay for certifications—down to 73% from 89% the previous year—is concerning in this regard. If this turns out to be an emerging trend, organizations should review this decision as part of their risk management strategy.

The impact of those security incidents is significant. More than half (52%) of organizations surveyed say breaches cost them more than $1 million. This is roughly in line with last year’s 53% and up from 38% in 2021.

Skilled and aware employees and cybersecurity professionals are crucial to overall cyber risk management in a world that is moved beyond the attack-and-defend cycle. Today, to protect themselves, organizations need to maintain a posture of perpetual vigilance and continuous risk awareness.

In response, organizations are turning increasingly to AI to strengthen their capabilities and posture, even as they acknowledge AI could also be used against them as an engine of new or improved cyberattacks. The majority (80%) say AI tools are helping their IT and security teams be more effective—though almost all are aware that AI won’t solve the ongoing skills shortage alone.

## AI Is Seen as a Threat, an Opportunity, and a Challenge
While organizations have concerns about AI-related risks, they also see AI as a potentially powerful tool for shoring up defenses—though it is a tool that must be managed by skilled professionals. The vast majority (97%) of this year’s respondents are either already using or planning to implement AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions.

The primary concern surrounding AI is its potential to drive an increase in cyberattacks (49%). This reflects growing unease about how AI can be leveraged by threat actors to develop more sophisticated, automated, and targeted attacks. Following that, a cluster of concerns emerges with similar levels of urgency: 39% worry about the spread of misinformation, because generative AI makes it easier to produce convincing fake content that can cause confusion, panic, or poor decision-making; 38% cite surveillance and privacy violations; and 37% express fears about the development of superintelligent AI and the broader risk of losing control—an issue that, while more speculative, is gaining traction in public debate.

Concern about AI-enabled cyberattacks may be contributing to the adoption of AI-powered cybersecurity solutions—which 65% of respondents have already implemented, and another 32% plan to implement in the next year. Just 2% say they have no plans to implement such tools.

The more attacks an organization has incurred, the more likely it is to have AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions in place. Roughly three quarters (76%) of organizations that experienced nine or more cyberattacks in 2024 say they had AI cybersecurity tools deployed, suggesting that frequent attacks may be driving interest in more innovative solutions.

Asked what they foresee as the biggest challenge to integrating AI into cybersecurity, 48% of IT decision makers point to a lack of staff with sufficient AI expertise. The ability to ensure data privacy and information security was a close second at 47%—linking back to respondents’ concerns about misinformation, surveillance, and privacy violations.

### Top AI Areas of Interest in Cybersecurity Among Organizations

- North America 42%

### Taking Action
#### Strengthen security awareness and training
This year’s AI findings correspond with our 2024 Security Awareness and Training Global Research Report, which showed that 62% of leaders were worried that employees would fall for more attacks because of AI. Considering the present findings about AI skills deficits and risks related to misinformation, data privacy, and information security, it seems that organizations believe their people may not be fully prepared to meet the AI moment.

#### Ask the right questions about AI
Instead of asking if vendors “have AI,” organizations need to start asking how they could use AI to support their specific security goals, such as analyzing logs (security information and event management (SIEM)) or autonomously responding to threats (endpoint detection and response (EDR), extended detection and response (XDR), and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)).

#### Understand what AI can do for you
Organizations also need to understand where AI can excel—in essence, serving as a kind of junior analyst to sort quickly through logs to pinpoint the root causes of threats and highlight key insights. This enables skilled personnel, like senior engineers, to focus on critical and timely analysis, make decisions, and oversee responses. Raising awareness and providing training can help address this.

#### Consider SOC-as-a-Service
Since few organizations have the specialized staff needed to run these systems independently, a security operations center (SOC)-as-a-Service (SOCaaS) is also an option. It allows an organization to benefit from AI security and expert guidance, like faster threat response, without the burden of managing the technology in-house.

![Percentage of leaders who think their board of directors is fully aware of potential risks posed to the organization by using AI]

## Boards Lack Cyber Knowledge—Even Though It’s a Priority
Even as corporate directors and executives continue to be held accountable for cybersecurity breaches, many board members are seen to be less than fully aware of the potential risks that AI use poses to their organizations.

Fewer than half (49%) of all respondents say they feel their board members are fully aware of AI risks. Somewhat fewer (42%) say board members are moderately aware; 7% say they are slightly aware. Of those with perceived higher AI awareness, 61% oversee organizations that currently use AI cybersecurity tools. Of those with perceived moderate awareness, 36% currently use AI cyber tools. Only 3% of slightly aware board members are using AI solutions.

The increasing board focus on cybersecurity may be partly attributable to the fact that 52% of organizations surveyed say directors or executives have faced fines (33%), jail time (15%), or loss of employment or position (33%) following a cyberattack—on par with the previous year. That 52% jumps to 76% for organizations that experienced five to eight cyberattacks in 2024.

Boards may be playing catch-up on AI, but in general, most are paying greater attention to cybersecurity: More than three-quarters (76%) of respondents say their board put more focus on cybersecurity in 2024, up from 72% in 2023. The vast majority of respondents say cybersecurity is a business (96%) and financial (95%) priority for their organization to some or a great extent.

To improve cybersecurity, leaders say their boards have discussed or implemented measures such as: mandatory training or certifications for IT and security staff (62%); security awareness training for all staff (55%—down from 61% in 2023); and purchasing security solutions that use AI (55%).

### Top Board-Driven Actions on Cybersecurity
Once again this year, among respondents aware of their boards’ focus, a clear majority said mandatory cybersecurity training and certifications for IT and security staff were the top actions discussed or implemented.

### Taking Action
#### Educate your board on cybersecurity and AI
Apart from continuing to be a growing priority, not much seems to have changed for boards between 2023 and 2024 with respect to cybersecurity. Given the high stakes associated with breaches and the fact that directors and executives are still held personally liable for security breaches, this lack of change is a sign that more needs to be done--especially considering that boards currently possess a lower awareness of AI risks while AI use continues to grow and AI-driven attacks are expected to increase.

Boards play a key role in setting direction on cyber risk management and resilience. Organizations need to recruit knowledgeable and aware board members, and ensure that boards establish and strengthen committees focused on cybersecurity.

As part of a multi-pronged cybersecurity approach, boards may need to undergo cyber education and be brought up to speed on the risks, challenges, and opportunities presented by AI. Cybersecurity is a fully shared responsibility and boards must do their part.

#### Develop a cybersecurity risk management plan
Proactive board members could begin their AI awareness process by inquiring about their organization's cyber risk management readiness. One useful question might focus on the organization’s mean time to respond (MTTR) to attacks, since slow detection often leads to slow recovery.

#### Ensure you have the right cyber solutions in place
To shrink a high MTTR, organizations could look for tools that find threats early and enable a quick response. One example is a security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) platform, which addresses incidents the moment they occur. Others include endpoint detection and response (EDR), network detection and response (NDR) and extended detection response (XDR), which all work together to provide the unified view needed for a rapid response.

![Percentage of IT decision makers citing lack of cybersecurity awareness as top cause of breaches]

## Lack of Cybersecurity Awareness and Training Remains the Top Cause of Breaches
IT leaders attribute cybersecurity breaches to three interrelated factors: lack of employee security awareness (56%), lack of cybersecurity skills and trained IT or security staff (54%), and lack of necessary cybersecurity products (50%).

These figures are similar to last year, with lack of awareness moving into the top position and slight drops related to skills and training and cybersecurity products (both down four percentage points from 2023, where they were at 58% and 54% respectively).

Most respondents (67%) said the cybersecurity skills shortage creates additional risks for their organizations, roughly the same as in 2023 (70%). Data, cloud, and network security are the cybersecurity skills organizations need most.

Largely aligning with the top causes of breaches, IT leaders say their main responses to a cyberattack would be to:
- Expand their internal IT or security team (63%)
- Mandate cybersecurity training in the form of certifications for IT and security personnel (62%)
- Introduce employee awareness and training programs (59%)
- Purchase new security solutions (56%)

### Cyberattacks Continue to Target End Users
With malware, phishing, and web attacks once again ‘topping the charts’ of attack types at 78% (in line with 80% in 2023), bad actors clearly see users as the weak link in organizations’ security postures—reinforcing IT leaders’ impressions of what causes breaches.

### Taking Action
#### Manage cyber risk proactively
While some types of cyberattacks are more common than others (see page 21), organizations cannot predict which specific attacks they are likely to experience.

Organizations need to treat cybersecurity as a strategic, corporate-wide initiative that includes managing risk proactively rather than taking a purely reactive defense-and-response approach.

#### Hire based on cyber skills and knowledge
As part of this plan, security leaders should ensure clear communication between hiring managers and HR to ensure that the best individuals are hired to fill vacant or new positions, focusing on fit within the organization and acquired cyber skills and knowledge. When assessing the team, training and certification can help new and existing employees upskill or reskill in growing areas of concern.

#### Seek industry-recognized training and certification
Security leaders should seek out cybersecurity providers with industry-recognized certification programs and a strong focus on role-based training. The most valuable certifications align with key areas of cybersecurity, and support ongoing skill development across all experience levels.

#### Keep training and awareness programs up to date
The strategy should also include implementing and continually revising security awareness programs for all employees, and assessing network architecture and vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis to align with the plan and people required to execute the plan.

If organizations want to provide an extra layer of protection against the human errors that their employees might unintentionally make, leveraging AI-powered security tools that can help protect email, browsers, and collaboration tools can significantly reduce the most vulnerable attack surfaces. By automatically neutralizing threats within the applications that employees use daily, security teams can shrink their response times and prevent minor human errors from escalating into major security incidents.

## Organizations Want Cybersecurity Personnel with Certifications
In 2021, the first year of the Cybersecurity Skills Gap survey, 81% of respondents said they preferred to hire cybersecurity personnel with certifications. A year later, that figure jumped to 90%—and it has remained essentially the same since.

In 2024, 89% of IT decision makers expressed a preference for certified candidates. A good majority (67%) said they looked for certifications when hiring a team member or direct report because it validates cybersecurity awareness and knowledge. Nearly the same number (61%) said they see certifications as a sign of being able to keep up with the evolving security landscape. More than half (56%) said certifications indicate familiarity with security vendor products.

Despite the advantages and the clear preference for certifications, the percentage of organizations willing to pay for employees to obtain certifications fell sharply in this most recent survey—down to 73% from 89% in 2023. A full quarter (25%) say they would not pay for a certification, up from just 7% in 2023. While it’s unclear what has motivated this shift, it seems out of step with the recognition that training and certifications make a difference.

### Knowledge and Performance Drive the Preference for Certifications
Looking at the past four years of survey findings, respondents most strongly and consistently prefer certified candidates for the skills, knowledge, and competencies they bring.

### DIGGING DEEPER
#### Certifications Have Real Impact
**The Prevalence of Certifications is Still High**
Most respondents have people on their teams with technology-focused certifications or have certifications themselves:
- 86% have someone on their team with a technology-focused certification.
- 81% have technology-focused certifications themselves (though this is down from 84% in 2023 and continuing a decline from 86% in 2021).

**Certifications Bring Observable Benefits**
Respondents continue to indicate a range of advantages from certifications for themselves and for others:
- 61% report increased cybersecurity skills and knowledge.
- 55% cite the ability to better perform job tasks.
- 50% note faster career progression or promotion.

**Bigger Companies Seem to Put More Value on Certifications**
Larger organizations prefer and are slightly more willing to pay for certifications:
- 77% of organizations with 5,000 or more employees are willing to pay for certifications, versus 72% for smaller organizations.
- Roughly 69% of respondents from organizations with 1,000 or more employees look for certifications—compared to 64% in those with 500 to 999 employees.

### Taking Action
#### Consider multiple pathways to expertise
Fortinet research shows that organizations need to embrace multiple “pathways to expertise” to overcome the skills gap and fill essential cybersecurity roles. Certifications are one such pathway, providing hands-on experience and industry-recognized credentials.

Most leaders realize this, with 61% citing better cybersecurity skills and knowledge as a top benefit of certifications. Leaders are also more likely to hire candidates who already have a certification.

What is confusing this year is the drop in organizations willing to pay for certifications. More data is needed to understand what is behind this decline. In today’s economic climate, one could argue that organizations are concerned about costs. If this is the case, it should be kept in mind that savings from AI and security automation can free up funds to invest in education of employees, providing them with the opportunity to acquire the skills, and knowledge needed to strengthen the security posture of the organization.

#### Prioritize employee skills and knowledge
Retention of key employees also plays a part. Organizations need to invest in employees as part of their retention strategy. Nearly half of survey respondents say a lack of training and upskilling opportunities (48%) was their number one retention challenge. IT decision makers seem to recognize this, given their preference for candidates with certifications—which makes the decline in the number of organizations willing to pay for certifications all the more puzzling.

## Potential Talent Pools Are Being Overlooked
While organizations have made some gains tapping into certain underutilized talent pools in the last four years, they still say the skills gap is compromising their cybersecurity. Part of the problem may be how they define “qualified candidates”.

The percentage of organizations reporting difficulty finding qualified women and minority candidates has dropped substantially since our first Cybersecurity Skills Gap survey in 2021—down from 30% to 20% in 2024 for women and from 38% to 29% for minority candidates.

That said, those figures have essentially held steady over the last two years, and veterans and veterans’ spouses remain considerably harder to recruit at 43% and 41%, respectively. While some of this difficulty may be a supply problem or related to challenges accessing specific talent pools, it may also be attributable to organizations ruling out potential candidates because of their qualifications.

More than half (52%) of organizations consider whether a candidate has a four-year degree when hiring, and a clear majority (65%) consider professional certifications. Allowing for other levels of education or credentials could open the way to more talent, if organizations were willing to invest in on-the-job development after hiring.

### Structured Recruiting Initiatives for Key Talent Pools Seem to Be Slowly Declining
Since 2021, the percentage of respondents who say their organization has structured recruiting initiatives for women, minorities, veterans, and veterans’ spouses has declined in all cases except veterans’ spouses.

**Organizations with structure recruiting initiatives**
- Women
  - 2024: 70%
  - 2023: 73%
  - 2022: 73%
  - 2021: 75%

  - 2023: 60%
  - 2022: 59%
  - 2021: 59%
- Veterans
  - 2024: 45%
  - 2023: 45%
  - 2022: 43%
  - 2021: 51%
- Veterans’ Spouses
  - 2024: 38%
  - 2023: 36%
  - 2022: NA
  - 2021: NA

### DIGGING DEEPER
#### Employment Levels Reflect Hiring Difficulty
**Women Make Up the Biggest Proportion of Non-Traditional IT and Security Hires**
Taken as a mean across all organizations surveyed:
- 27% of employees on IT and security teams are women.
- 20% come from minority backgrounds.
- 17% are veterans.
- 15% are veterans’ spouses.

**Some Organizations Do Consider Alternative Credentials**
Respondents said they would consider factors outside of four-year degrees:
- 43% say they would consider whether a candidate has a diploma.
- 38% say they would consider whether or not a candidate has had vendor training.

### Taking Action
#### Account for both skills and knowledge
Trying to draw from smaller talent pools in a competitive labor market requires flexible and creative strategies. Over-reliance on traditional credentials such as four-year degrees could be limiting employers’ access to the talent they need.

As noted in this report, recent Fortinet research shows organizations need to use multiple pathways to find and develop talent, including considering different mixes of credentials and hands-on skill development.

#### Work closely with HR on job requirements
Cybersecurity leaders should work with HR to ensure the posted qualifications for a position match the organization’s skills and knowledge needs, that all potential talent pools are considered, and allow for various training options to fill the role.

#### Support public-private-partnerships (PPPs) that address the cyber skills gap
On a larger scale, building a talent pool for the global cybersecurity industry that includes all populations will require closer partnerships between industry, academia, and government. Already in the U.S. and other countries, a shift is underway toward two-year cybersecurity programs that are funded by governments to help address the skills gap.

## Conclusion
Cybersecurity has become an increasingly strategic concern for organizations around the world, shaped by the rise of AI and the comprehensive array of risks that cyberthreats pose to a business. The need for a strategic approach is pushing cybersecurity past the C-suite all the way up to the board level.

As boards take on more responsibility for cybersecurity, corporate directors are under pressure to understand the issues so they can make informed risk-management decisions. In some cases—especially where AI is concerned—this may require cyber-risk education and training for board members.

AI simultaneously poses risks and has tremendous potential to enhance cybersecurity solutions. Outside of boards of directors, organizations need to ensure that all their people are “AI aware” and that cybersecurity teams have the skills to work with AI tools. It’s also important for teams to appreciate what AI can and can’t do—where it can bring efficiencies and ease burdens, and where skilled human beings with expert judgment are still essential.

That need for skilled people means the ongoing global cybersecurity skills shortage remains a problem. Organizations can maximize their opportunities to fill crucial roles by shifting their expectations about the credentials that candidates need to bring—for example, insisting less on four-year degrees—and accessing underutilized pools of talent. Closing the skills gap also requires investment in training and development. Rather than wait for a 'perfect' candidate, organizations may be better served by hiring people with high potential and good fit, and training them for a specific role. By putting money into training and development, this year's findings also suggest that organizations stand a better chance of retaining the talent they hire. On this point, it can’t be stressed enough that the reluctance to pay for certifications that turned up in this year’s results may seriously undermine organizations’ cybersecurity objectives. Training and certifications remain fundamental to the three-pronged cybersecurity approach alongside general employee awareness and deployment of the right technologies.

Fortinet has embraced that three-pronged approach—awareness, training, and technology—for several years. With this year’s survey, we’re seeing that approach fit within the larger framework of holistic cyber risk management. As risk management matures, it will empower organizations to proactively protect themselves, their data, and their businesses, no matter how threats and technologies evolve.
