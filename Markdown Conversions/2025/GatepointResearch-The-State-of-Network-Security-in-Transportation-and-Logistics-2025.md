# Executive Summary
The Network Security Trends in Transportation and
Logistics Survey, conducted from February to May 2025,
offers an in-depth view of how IT and security leaders
across the sector are preparing for digital
transformation. With a focus on performance, visibility,
and security, these organizations are facing mounting
challenges tied to legacy infrastructure, limited
resources, and growing cyber threats.

The report identifies a consistent demand for
simplification, stronger observability, better protection
against ransomware, and support for hybrid application
environments. Most are still in early stages of GenAI
preparedness and security convergence, with many
seeking solutions that can meet both operational and
strategic objectives.

Cheers,

Team Aryaka

# Introduction
The transportation and logistics sector sits at the
intersection of physical and digital infrastructure. As
supply chains become more connected and
cloud-enabled, network complexity and cybersecurity
risk have increased. Organizations now operate
global, hybrid environments supporting warehouses,
fleets, air and sea transport, and real-time systems.
This survey captures the challenges and goals of IT
leaders in the industry, offering a snapshot of evolving
trends and readiness.

# Who We Surveyed
Who participated in the survey?

Excecutives from the transportation and logistics industry responded. The group included C-level executives,
IT directors, and operations managers—representing a range of perspectives across digital transformation,
infrastructure, and security.

![Pie chart showing survey respondent roles: Manager 54%, CxO 4%, VP 4%, Director 38%.]

46% of respondents to this survey
hold executive or director-level
positions in their organization.

# Comparison with Manufacturing Sector
This survey echoes many of the findings reported in Aryaka’s State of Network Security in Manufacturing (2024),
which examined similar challenges in a related operationally intensive industry.

Shared Trends:

- High prioritization of cost
control, visibility, and network
modernization

- Hybrid and cloud migration
strategies dominate

- Limited IT resources pose
barriers to modernization

Transportation vs. Manufacturing:

- Transportation respondents
place more emphasis on
mobility and remote access
control

- GenAI preparedness
appears slightly lower in
transportation

- Manufacturing respondents
showed stronger early
movement toward multi-cloud
acceleration and edge security

# Strategic Recommendations & Concluding Thoughts

1. **Improve Observability**

Gain holistic insights across network and application layers.

2. **Relieve IT Burden**

Evaluate opportunities for co-management or service-based delivery.

3. **Secure the Edge**

Align access and enforcement with remote and distributed user needs.

4. **Pursue Integration**

Reduce fragmentation between network and security tools to boost
agility and reduce complexity.

Concluding Thoughts

Transportation and logistics enterprises are entering a period of digital acceleration. With globally distributed
facilities and increasing reliance on cloud and AI, the need for resilient, high-performance, and secure network
infrastructure is urgent. This report confirms the direction of change and underscores the importance of cohesive
strategies that support operational scale, visibility, and cyber readiness.
