# Ransomware Risk Report

A modest decrease in ransomware success is encouraging,
but attack-related business disruptions continue

Increased frequency and sophistication of attacks, identity
system compromise, and legacy vulnerabilities top the list of
cybersecurity challenges

To build business resilience, organizations must balance
cybersecurity efforts across people, processes, and technology

> “I do believe that we can make ransomware a shocking anomaly. And that is the world I want to live in: a world where software vulnerabilities are so rare that they make the nightly news, not the morning meeting. A world where cyber-attacks are as infrequent as plane collisions. I do believe we can get there.”

> Former Director of the Cybersecurity

## A World Without Ransomware? We Aren’t There Yet.
### Business leaders are catching up with the business benefits of cyber resilience … but challenges persist.

The spread of generative AI, an increasing concern about agentic AI attacks, rising geopolitical tensions, global regulatory shifts … many new developments have occurred since we released the 2024 Ransomware Risk Report. Has the ransomware landscape shifted as a result? And how well are organizations adapting to today’s threats?

There’s good news in this year’s findings: Ransomware attack frequency and success saw modest decreases. But as former US National Cyber Director and Semperis Strategic Advisor Chris Inglis told us, “Now is not the time for complacency. True regret isn’t not knowing what you should have done; it’s not having done what you knew was needed and had the means to do.”

Organizations across the globe still see cyberattacks as the biggest threat to business resilience, and an increase in the frequency and sophistication of those attacks is their top cybersecurity concern. Fortunately, business leaders now seem to agree; lack of Board support for cybersecurity initiatives—the top challenge cited by respondents last year—dropped to last place in the list of this year’s concerns.

What can organizations do to prepare for the new generation of AI-driven attacks? Our panel of experts weighs in on steps you can take today to reduce ransomware threats that exploit legacy vulnerabilities and the identity infrastructure—organizations’ other two top cybersecurity concerns—while managing business resilience challenges, including regulatory compliance. We hope you find these tips useful in the continued fight against ransomware and other cyber threats.

For this report, we partnered with international research firm Censuswide, expanding the scope of our study to include 10 countries and 8 industry sectors across North America, Europe, the United Kingdom, and Asia Pacific. The 2025 Ransomware Risk Report offers a more extensive view into the activity and business impact of ransomware around the world.

> “Paying ransoms should never be the default option. While some circumstances might leave the company in a no-choice situation, we should acknowledge that it’s a downpayment on the next attack. Every dollar handed to ransomware gangs fuels their criminal economy, incentivizing them to strike again. The only real way to break the ransomware scourge is to invest in resilience, creating an option to not pay ransom.”

> Mickey Bresman
> Semperis CEO

We encourage you to share this information with your IT and security teams. Most important, share these findings with your organization’s business leadership—and build alignment around the actions your organization must take to ensure operational resilience in the face of ransomware’s never-ending threat.

## Key Findings
![Infographic summarizing key findings of the report, including statistics on ransomware targeting, payments, identity infrastructure compromise, attack sophistication, and recovery rates.]

*   **Adopting an assume breach mindset is still necessary.**
    *   **78%** of respondents were targeted by ransomware within the past 12 months. Of companies that were successfully attacked, **73%** were attacked multiple times—**31%** three or more times.

*   **Ransom payment and business disruptions are still cause for concern.**
    *   **69%** of successful attacks resulted in ransom payment; **55%** paid multiple times. Ransom payments in the US increased over last year, with **81%** of organizations paying up. In addition, victims experienced job and data losses as well as cybersecurity cancellation or premium increases.

*   **Identity infrastructure represents an area of opportunity for enhanced defense.**
    *   **83%** of attacks compromised the identity infrastructure. Yet many organizations still lack AD recovery plans and dedicated, AD-specific backup systems.

*   **Attack sophistication and legacy vulnerabilities threaten cyber—and business—resilience.**
    *   **50%** of organizations cited cybersecurity threats as the top threat to business resilience. Despite a drop this year in ransomware attack frequency and success, increased frequency and sophistication of attacks were the top cybersecurity challenge for **37%** of respondents, followed closely by attacks against the identity infrastructure for **32%** of organizations.

*   **Bad actors are finding new ways to force victims’ hands.**
    *   **47%** of attacks leveraged threats to file regulatory complaints against the victims, while **40%** involved physical threats against staff.

*   **Ransom payments do not guarantee recovery.**
    *   **15%** of ransomware victims that paid either did not receive decryption keys or received corrupted keys. An additional **3%** received usable keys but discovered that the attackers had published or otherwise illegally used their stolen data.

## Are We Gaining Ground Against Ransomware?
### Optimistic? Yes. Off the hook? Not even close.

Let’s start with some (cautionary) good news: Globally, study respondents reported slightly fewer ransomware attacks than in the previous year. Still, a clear majority (**78%**) said they were targeted by ransomware during the past 12 months.

Clearly, an assume breach mindset is still necessary.

More mixed news: Successful attacks dropped to just over half (**56%**) of targeted organizations. However, **73%** of those victims suffered multiple attacks; **31%** were attacked three or more times. At least those organizations gained a little breathing space. Fewer respondents this year reported simultaneous or same-day attacks.

> “If attackers start getting less money, they will adapt and pivot to something that can increase their profit margins. When ransom payments start going down, cyber criminals are going to adapt and figure out what will force companies to pay them.”
>
> Jeff Wichman
> Semperis Director of Incident Response

This year’s study also revealed a modest reduction in the number of organizations that paid ransom globally (**69%**) over the past year. But don’t pop the champagne just yet: More than half (**55%**) of organizations that paid did so multiple times, with over one-quarter (**29%**) of those paying three or more times.

> “Nation-state actors are often after intel. They aren’t demanding ransom, they’re learning your systems, your operation; they’re monitoring data transactions. They’re looking for your weak spots and ways to create the biggest impact. Intelligence-gathering missions are meant to go unnoticed.”
>
> Courtney Guss
> Semperis Director of Crisis Management

### Are ransomware attacks really decreasing?
“Improvements in procedures and tools that enable faster patching or that automate containment—including newly minted AI-based defense solutions—are making a positive impact,” explains Yossi Rachman, Semperis Director of Security Research. “So, too, are large, successful law-enforcement campaigns against cybercrime rings. For example, Operation Cronos drastically disrupted LockBit operations. But even with financially motivated groups, we’re also seeing attackers shift from a ‘spray and pray’ approach to high-value targets and deeper reconnaissance.”

Even small reductions in ransomware frequency and success are encouraging. But now is not the time for complacency, warns Inglis.

“Organizational leadership has become more aware of their dependence on digital infrastructure,” Inglis says. “That makes them more committed to inherent resilience, recovery, and response than they might have been before. That’s good news. But I think that the people they rely on—the IT and cyber staff—would say that the environment is just as challenging. The attackers have not backed off. If we believe that we’ve whistled past the graveyard, we’ll be in trouble.”

In addition, we caution readers that fewer ransomware attacks do not necessarily equate with fewer attacks overall. As our experts noted in Semperis’ report The State of Critical Infrastructure Resilience, many cyberattacks—especially geopolitically motivated ones—aim to infiltrate rather than extort.

“Different attack groups are motivated by different goals,” says Rachman. “Certain nation states, primarily those that are under international sanctions, see ransomware as a means to obtain funds. Others aim to create persistent access, taking a ‘low and slow’ approach to bide their time and create bridgeheads that enable them to disrupt the target’s operations. And certain crime rings are motivated by financial gain but sponsored, or at least tacitly approved, by nation states that allow them to operate independently with the understanding that the attackers will also serve as an extension of their military operations if needed.”

Ransomware, by its nature, is designed to make itself known to victims. After all, you need to know where and how to pay off the bad guys. In contrast, attacks that are designed to “live off the land” and establish persistence or exfiltrate sensitive data can be devilishly difficult to detect. Without sophisticated tools that provide extensive visibility and root out indicators of attack and compromise, such threats can lie in wait for many months.

## Getting Back to Business … Eventually
### Despite gains in fending off attacks, business disruptions are continuous, persistent, and potentially life-threatening.

Although the global decrease in attack success is encouraging, it had a negligible effect on business disruption for our study respondents.

Even for those who paid ransom, those losses—between $500,000 and $1,000,000 annually for **50%** and over $1,000,000 for **8%** of study participants who paid—were just the tip of the iceberg. On average, **15%** of victims failed to receive usable decryption keys, even after paying ransom. Another **3%** discovered that attackers had published or illegally used their stolen data.

And as in last year’s study, ransomware victims suffered a range of collateral damages. For many industries, those disruptions can be catastrophic. Recent attacks on healthcare organizations have resulted in patient deaths. And attacks that disrupt critical infrastructure could cause widespread chaos, damage, and human casualties.

Collateral expense, in the form of job losses, data compromise, and cyber insurance cancellation or price hikes topped respondents’ concerns. For CISOs and other executives, the fallout from a successful (and expensive) attack often results in firing or retirement. For others, the cost of ransom payments can result in belt-tightening that forces staff layoffs.

Many companies suffered data loss or compromise, troubling given ransomware attackers’ known tendency to use stolen data to launch additional exploits.

> “The most important thing that you can do to prevent yourself from falling victim to a ransomware attack is … to prepare your business for disruption: to have backups in place, to ensure that your technology is as secure as possible, that you’ve implemented multi-factor authentication, that you’ve patched your internet-facing devices.”
>
> Jen Easterly
> Former Director of CISA

warns Jeff Wichman, Semperis Director of Incident Response. To protect your investment, he says, “You need to determine what your weak spots are, think of different tactics that an attacker might throw at you, start building from there—and then test, test, test.”

Another worrying bit of news: Organizations were slower to recover from attacks this year. Less than one quarter (**23%**) were able to recover within a day, compared with **39%** last year. And **18%** needed between one week and one month, compared with just **11%** in 2024.

> “Once attackers access your data, the trust is broken. You can’t be sure it won’t be misused later, through extortion, resale, or strategic leaks. That’s why prevention is key. Organizations must prioritize tools and controls that stop attackers from moving laterally, escalating privileges after an initial breach. Protecting sensitive data at every level is essential to maintaining business continuity, reputation, and customer trust.”

> Cohesity CEO

As for cyber insurance, “If you don’t properly secure your environment, you’re going to pay more for your insurance—or you’re going to become uninsurable,” says Guido Grillenmeier, Semperis Principal Technologist (EMEA), “but being well-prepared for recovery is necessary to maintain business continuity and resilience. And during recovery, until you get your identities back, you can’t get anything else back.”

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
![Infographic showing key takeaways regarding business disruptions, ransom payments, and recovery times.]

*   **Total annual ransom paid**
    *   **42%** paid **$500,000** or less
    *   **50%** paid **$500,000-$1M**
    *   **8%** paid more than **$1M**

*   **Top 3 ransomware-related business disruptions**
    *   **62%** Job losses
    *   **61%** Data breach
    *   **46%** Cyber coverage disruption
    *   **Brand damage** was a top disruption for organizations in North America, Italy, Spain, and Singapore, as well as those in Government and Healthcare.
    *   Organizations in Germany and the UK and in the Education, Energy, Manufacturing/Utilities, and Travel/Transportation sectors all rated **revenue loss** as a top ransomware-related disruption.

*   **Time needed to return to normal operations**
    *   **23%** less than 1 day
    *   **58%** 1 day-1 week
    *   **18%** 1 week-1 month
    *   **By Country**: UK **30%**, FRANCE **26%** (needed between 1 week and 1 month)
    *   **By Industry**: GOVERNMENT **43%**, HEALTHCARE **31%** (needed between 1 week and 1 month)
    *   **30%** of UK organizations needed between 1 week and 1 month to resume normal business operations. This region also saw the biggest drop (28 percentage points) in same-day recovery. Organizations in Government and Healthcare took the longest to resume operations. Healthcare also saw a 28-percentage-point drop in same-day recovery.

*   Over **20%** of ransomware victims **failed to receive usable decryption keys** in Germany, Canada, and Australia/New Zealand, as well as in the Manufacturing/Utilities sector.

## Identity at the Heart of Defense—and Recovery
### Ready or not? ITDR efforts are widespread, but gaps remain.

More than three-quarters (**83%**) of study participants told us that attacks—regardless of entry point or level of success—compromised their identity systems. No surprises here; infiltrating Active Directory (AD), Entra ID, or Okta enables attackers to establish persistence, move laterally, and elevate privileges for greater reach once in the environment. With threat actors targeting the identity and access management (IAM) infrastructure itself, and credential abuse ranking as a top attack vector, organizations must strengthen their IAM defenses to stay ahead of attackers.

> “Identity is a core, foundational piece of your infrastructure that underpins every other function,” explains Cohesity CEO Sanjay Poonen. “The ability to recover identity to a trustworthy state is paramount, and every other piece of recovery builds from there—including data security and the ability to keep attackers from gaining a stronger foothold and accessing not just data but other Tier 0 resources.”

Many organizations now understand that identity security and resilience are foundational to cyber and business resilience. Yet despite **90%** of respondents telling us that they have implemented an Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) strategy, a much smaller percentage (just **66%**) include AD recovery procedures in their disaster recovery plan, and only **60%** maintain dedicated, AD-specific backup systems—both key parts of effective ITDR. That’s a gap that attackers will be more than happy to exploit.

> “As with any cybersecurity effort, it boils down to a combination of people, processes, and technology,” says Sean Deuby, Semperis Principal Technologist (Americas). “In terms of people, you need cybersecurity training at every level and in every department. Everybody needs to know their part and what to do. And in terms of processes, you can start by calculating your minimum viable company, establishing isolated recovery environments, network segmentation, identity recovery, and having a customized, documented, and practiced crisis response plan.”

Courtney Guss, Semperis Director of Crisis Management, notes the importance of identifying your core digital capabilities. “When you have identified your minimum viable services—the things needed to keep the business operational, the lights on, and the doors open—you can focus on restoring and recovering those systems, then spend time fixing the rest. Not everything needs to be fixed in the first 24 hours.”

But during recovery, until you get your identities back, you can’t get anything else back.

> “Too often, organizations miss bad actors within the environment because it just looks like normal activity,” says Guss. “Managing critical vulnerabilities or known vulnerabilities can be time-consuming, but you wouldn’t leave your car unlocked. Too often, critical operating systems and applications aren’t just left unlocked, the key is left in the ignition. That’s where identity and access control come in.”

### How can organizations successfully combat identity-related ransomware threats to build operational resilience?

> “Active Directory is obviously a key vector for attack. If you have been breached, the ability to restore the integrity of your Active Directory, very quickly, is paramount.”
>
> Malcolm Turnbull
> Former Australian Prime Minister and Semperis Strategic Advisor

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
![Infographic showing key takeaways regarding identity infrastructure compromise and AD recovery plans.]

*   **83%** of organizations experienced **identity-infrastructure compromise**.
    *   **93%** of organizations in Asia/Pacific experienced **identity-infrastructure compromise**, as did **89%** of Canadian organizations and **87%** of companies in the IT/Telecom sector.

*   Only **66%** of organizations maintain an AD recovery plan.
    *   **By Location**: UK **76%**, ASIA/PACIFIC **67%**, EUROPE **60%**, NORTH AMERICA **60%**
    *   **By Country**: GERMANY **52%**, ITALY **48%**, CANADA **45%**, FRANCE **44%**
    *   **76%** of UK organizations and **71%** of Spanish organizations **have an AD recovery plan**. So do **77%** of Government organizations and **74%** of companies in the Energy sector.

*   **40%** of organizations still do not maintain dedicated, AD-specific backup systems.
    *   **By Industry**: GOVERNMENT **77%**, ENERGY **74%**, EDUCATION **72%**
    *   **By Industry**: IT/TELECOM **43%**, TRAVEL/TRANSPORT **43%**, FINANCE **41%**
    *   Organizations in Germany—**most likely to be attacked and to be attacked successfully**—had the smallest increase (just 2 percentage points) in dedicated, AD-specific backup systems and were least likely of all countries (**52%**) to maintain such systems. Only **52%** have an AD recovery plan—again, the least of all countries. Companies in the IT/Telecom, Travel/Transportation, and Finance sectors were least likely to maintain dedicated, AD-specific backup systems. In Singapore and in the Energy sector, **69%** of organizations maintain such systems—the most of any country or industry.

## Meeting the Moment
### Where Do We Go from Here?
### Cybersecurity experts offer advice for meeting top challenges to resilience.

Despite the positive trends we see in this year’s study, organizations still view cyberattacks as the biggest threat to their business and operational resilience. And they view the frequency and complexity of those attacks, along with threats to the identity infrastructure and vulnerabilities posed by legacy systems and years of technological debt, as their biggest cybersecurity challenges.

So, what can organizations do over the coming year to build on successes and increase their resilience against ransomware?

>
> Sean Deuby
> Semperis Principal Technologist
> (Americas)

> “With the introduction of generative AI and the fast development of agentic AI attacks, creating more advanced tools with more destructive impact is easier, so threat actors no longer need a lot of money and resources to create those tools. As a result, even a drop in ransom payments will not necessarily stop attack groups from proliferating and conducting more effective and frequent attacks.”

> Yossi Rachman
> Semperis Director of Security Research

### Commit to a culture of resilience
Long-term reductions in ransomware risk demand a proactive dedication to resilience, not just once or within the IT or cybersecurity departments, but continuously and throughout the organization.

> “Whatever advantage transgressors might have, you can take away,” says Inglis. “If they form syndicates and come at you from all sides, become part of a coalition of defense. If they take advantage of weaknesses in your security skills, processes, or technical architecture, bolster those areas. If they use generative AI to come at you faster, implement automation in recovery or defense. If they can lock down your primary store, maintain effective backup and recovery solutions.
>
> “Make the necessary investments to have appropriate resilience. Vigorously understand how your architecture is used so that you can detect a transgression at the earliest possible moment, bring a coalition to bear, and have backups so that you can respond and recover.
>
> “Take away attackers’ advantages. Any number of companies do. They’re
