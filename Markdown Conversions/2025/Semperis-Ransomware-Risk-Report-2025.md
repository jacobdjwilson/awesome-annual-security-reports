# Ransomware Risk Report

A modest decrease in ransomware success is encouraging, but attack-related business disruptions continue

Increased frequency and sophistication of attacks, identity system compromise, and legacy vulnerabilities top the list of cybersecurity challenges

To build business resilience, organizations must balance cybersecurity efforts across people, processes, and technology

> “I do believe that we can make ransomware a shocking anomaly. And that is the world I want to live in: a world where software vulnerabilities are so rare that they make the nightly news, not the morning meeting. A world where cyber-attacks are as infrequent as plane collisions. I do believe we can get there.”

Jen Easterly
Former Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA)

## A World Without Ransomware? We Aren’t There Yet.
Business leaders are catching up with the business benefits of cyber resilience … but challenges persist.

The spread of generative AI, an increasing concern about agentic AI attacks, rising geopolitical tensions, global regulatory shifts … many new developments have occurred since we released the 2024 Ransomware Risk Report. Has the ransomware landscape shifted as a result? And how well are organizations adapting to today’s threats?

There’s good news in this year’s findings: Ransomware attack frequency and success saw modest decreases. But as former US National Cyber Director and Semperis Strategic Advisor Chris Inglis told us, “Now is not the time for complacency. True regret isn’t not knowing what you should have done; it’s not having done what you knew was needed and had the means to do.”

Organizations across the globe still see cyberattacks as the biggest threat to business resilience, and an increase in the frequency and sophistication of those attacks is their top cybersecurity concern. Fortunately, business leaders now seem to agree; lack of Board support for cybersecurity initiatives—the top challenge cited by respondents last year—dropped to last place in the list of this year’s concerns.

What can organizations do to prepare for the new generation of AI-driven attacks? Our panel of experts weighs in on steps you can take today to reduce ransomware threats that exploit legacy vulnerabilities and the identity infrastructure—organizations’ other two top cybersecurity concerns—while managing business resilience challenges, including regulatory compliance. We hope you find these tips useful in the continued fight against ransomware and other cyber threats.

For this report, we partnered with international research firm Censuswide, expanding the scope of our study to include 10 countries and 8 industry sectors across North America, Europe, the United Kingdom, and Asia Pacific. The 2025 Ransomware Risk Report offers a more extensive view into the activity and business impact of ransomware around the world.

> “Paying ransoms should never be the default option. While some circumstances might leave the company in a no-choice situation, we should acknowledge that it’s a downpayment on the next attack. Every dollar handed to ransomware gangs fuels their criminal economy, incentivizing them to strike again. The only real way to break the ransomware scourge is to invest in resilience, creating an option to not pay ransom.”

We encourage you to share this information with your IT and security teams. Most important, share these findings with your organization’s business leadership—and build alignment around the actions your organization must take to ensure operational resilience in the face of ransomware’s never-ending threat.

## Key Findings
![Infographic summarizing key findings of the report, with six distinct sections.]

Adopting an assume breach mindset is still necessary.
**78%** of respondents were targeted by ransomware within the past 12 months. Of companies that were successfully attacked, **73%** were attacked multiple times—**31%** three or more times.

Ransom payment and business disruptions are still cause for concern.
**69%** of successful attacks resulted in ransom payment; **55%** paid multiple times. Ransom payments in the US increased over last year, with **81%** of organizations paying up. In addition, victims experienced job and data losses as well as cybersecurity cancellation or premium increases.

Identity infrastructure represents an area of opportunity for enhanced defense.
**83%** of attacks compromised the identity infrastructure. Yet many organizations still lack AD recovery plans and dedicated, AD-specific backup systems.

Attack sophistication and legacy vulnerabilities threaten cyber—and business—resilience.
**50%** of organizations cited cybersecurity threats as the top threat to business resilience. Despite a drop this year in ransomware attack frequency and success, increased frequency and sophistication of attacks were the top cybersecurity challenge for **37%** of respondents, followed closely by attacks against the identity infrastructure for **32%** of organizations.

Bad actors are finding new ways to force victims’ hands.
**47%** of attacks leveraged threats to file regulatory complaints against the victims, while **40%** involved physical threats against staff.

Ransom payments do not guarantee recovery.
**15%** of ransomware victims that paid either did not receive decryption keys or received corrupted keys. An additional **3%** received usable keys but discovered that the attackers had published or otherwise illegally used their stolen data.

## Are We Gaining Ground Against Ransomware?
Optimistic? Yes. Off the hook? Not even close.

Let’s start with some (cautionary) good news: Globally, study respondents reported slightly fewer ransomware attacks than in the previous year. Still, a clear majority (**78%**) said they were targeted by ransomware during the past 12 months.

Clearly, an assume breach mindset is still necessary.

More mixed news: Successful attacks dropped to just over half (**56%**) of targeted organizations. However, **73%** of those victims suffered multiple attacks; **31%** were attacked three or more times. At least those organizations gained a little breathing space. Fewer respondents this year reported simultaneous or same-day attacks.

> “If attackers start getting less money, they will adapt and pivot to something that can increase their profit margins. When ransom payments start going down, cyber criminals are going to adapt and figure out what will force companies to pay them.”

Jeff Wichman
Semperis Director of Incident Response

This year’s study also revealed a modest reduction in the number of organizations that paid ransom globally (**69%**) over the past year. But don’t pop the champagne just yet: More than half (**55%**) of organizations that paid did so multiple times, with over one-quarter (**29%**) of those paying three or more times.

> “Nation-state actors are often after intel. They aren’t demanding ransom, they’re learning your systems, your operation; they’re monitoring data transactions. They’re looking for your weak spots and ways to create the biggest impact. Intelligence-gathering missions are meant to go unnoticed.”

Courtney Guss
Semperis Director of Crisis Management

Are ransomware attacks really decreasing?
“Improvements in procedures and tools that enable faster patching or that automate containment—including newly minted AI-based defense solutions—are making a positive impact,” explains Yossi Rachman, Semperis Director of Security Research. “So, too, are large, successful law-enforcement campaigns against cybercrime rings. For example, Operation Cronos drastically disrupted LockBit operations. But even with financially motivated groups, we’re also seeing attackers shift from a ‘spray and pray’ approach to high-value targets and deeper reconnaissance.”

Even small reductions in ransomware frequency and success are encouraging. But now is not the time for complacency, warns Inglis.

“Organizational leadership has become more aware of their dependence on digital infrastructure,” Inglis says. “That makes them more committed to inherent resilience, recovery, and response than they might have been before. That’s good news. But I think that the people they rely on—the IT and cyber staff—would say that the environment is just as challenging. The attackers have not backed off. If we believe that we’ve whistled past the graveyard, we’ll be in trouble.”

In addition, we caution readers that fewer ransomware attacks do not necessarily equate with fewer attacks overall. As our experts noted in Semperis’ report The State of Critical Infrastructure Resilience, many cyberattacks—especially geopolitically motivated ones—aim to infiltrate rather than extort.

“Different attack groups are motivated by different goals,” says Rachman. “Certain nation states, primarily those that are under international sanctions, see ransomware as a means to obtain funds. Others aim to create persistent access, taking a ‘low and slow’ approach to bide their time and create bridgeheads that enable them to disrupt the target’s operations. And certain crime rings are motivated by financial gain but sponsored, or at least tacitly approved, by nation states that allow them to operate independently with the understanding that the attackers will also serve as an extension of their military operations if needed.”

Ransomware, by its nature, is designed to make itself known to victims. After all, you need to know where and how to pay off the bad guys. In contrast, attacks that are designed to “live off the land” and establish persistence or exfiltrate sensitive data can be devilishly difficult to detect. Without sophisticated tools that provide extensive visibility and root out indicators of attack and compromise, such threats can lie in wait for many months.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

## Getting Back to Business … Eventually
Despite gains in fending off attacks, business disruptions are continuous, persistent, and potentially life-threatening.

Although the global decrease in attack success is encouraging, it had a negligible effect on business disruption for our study respondents.

Even for those who paid ransom, those losses—between $500,000 and $1,000,000 annually for **50%** and over $1,000,000 for **8%** of study participants who paid—were just the tip of the iceberg. On average, **15%** of victims failed to receive usable decryption keys, even after paying ransom. Another **3%** discovered that attackers had published or illegally used their stolen data.

And as in last year’s study, ransomware victims suffered a range of collateral damages. For many industries, those disruptions can be catastrophic. Recent attacks on healthcare organizations have resulted in patient deaths. And attacks that disrupt critical infrastructure could cause widespread chaos, damage, and human casualties.

Collateral expense, in the form of job losses, data compromise, and cyber insurance cancellation or price hikes topped respondents’ concerns. For CISOs and other executives, the fallout from a successful (and expensive) attack often results in firing or retirement. For others, the cost of ransom payments can result in belt-tightening that forces staff layoffs.

Many companies suffered data loss or compromise, troubling given ransomware attackers’ known tendency to use stolen data to launch additional exploits.

> “The most important thing that you can do to prevent yourself from falling victim to a ransomware attack is … to prepare your business for disruption: to have backups in place, to ensure that your technology is as secure as possible, that you’ve implemented multi-factor authentication, that you’ve patched your internet-facing devices.”
