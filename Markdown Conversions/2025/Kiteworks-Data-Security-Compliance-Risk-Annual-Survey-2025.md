# Data Security and Compliance Risk: 2025 Annual Survey Report

## Executive Summary

Welcome to Kiteworks’ fourth annual Data Security and Compliance Risk: 2025 Annual Survey Report. This year’s findings reveal a stark truth: Organizations operating blind face exponentially higher risks than those with clear visibility and governance. The data is unequivocal—what you don’t know compounds into catastrophic security failures, and those lacking visibility invariably lack proper data governance.

**Key Findings:**

*   **46%** of organizations that don’t know their breach frequency also couldn’t quantify litigation costs.
*   **60%** of those unaware of their AI data usage have no privacy technologies.
*   **36%** of organizations adopted basic governance frameworks.
*   Only **17%** of organizations have fully implemented AI governance frameworks on average across industries.
*   **25%** of ungoverned organizations rely solely on contractual approaches that may not withstand regulatory scrutiny.¹

Poor visibility and weak governance create a deadly combination—exponentially multiplying risk.

## 10 Critical Findings That Define 2025

1.  **Detection Delays Cost Millions.** 31% of organizations with 5,000+ third parties take >90 days to detect breaches. Organizations with longer detection times face significantly higher litigation costs.
2.  **AI Blind Spots Create Total Exposure.** 36% of organizations that are unaware of their AI data usage have no privacy technologies. Organizations struggle with AI oversight, with only 17% claiming to have technical governance frameworks. This gap creates dangerous blind spots as AI adoption accelerates.
3.  **Third-Party Volume Predicts Breach Frequency.** Organizations with 5,000+ third parties with which they exchange private data face 10+ annual breaches at a rate of 24%, while those with <500 partners show 34% zero breaches.
4.  **The 1,001–5,000 Partner Danger Zone.** Mid-sized ecosystems face 46% increased supply chain risks—the highest of any segment. They have enterprise-scale problems with mid-market resources.
5.  **Breaches Drive Exponential Costs.** While 45% with 1–3 annual hacks face <$1M costs, 77% with 10+ hacks face >$3M litigation. Costs escalate dramatically with each breach tier.
6.  **Motivations Shift From Proactive to Reactive.** Low-breach organizations prioritize efficiency (27%). High-breach organizations chase financial damage control (37%). Success requires staying ahead.
7.  **The Privacy Dividend Emerges.** Organizations with mature privacy programs report 27% reduced security losses, 21% enhanced customer loyalty, and 21% improved operational efficiency—proving that privacy investment delivers measurable ROI beyond compliance.
8.  **The 35/46 Geopolitical Squeeze.** 35% face increased operational costs from tariffs while 46% see compliance tool budget increases—creating a dual pressure that makes geographic avoidance strategies obsolete.
9.  **The Hidden Cost Multiplier.** For every $1.00 spent on visible compliance, organizations incur $2.33 in hidden costs including opportunity costs, innovation delays, and audit fatigue—revealing the true burden of manual approaches. In addition, organizations with comprehensive governance achieve 3.5x better cost visibility—75% can specify their localization costs versus only 35% of those without governance plans.
10. **The Segregation Paradox.** 37% of organizations implement data segregation by geography to meet compliance, yet this fundamentally conflicts with AI’s need for unified data sets—creating a tension between compliance and innovation.

## The Four-Year Evolution: From Simple to Systemic

Note: Historical data from previous Kiteworks reports shows persistent gaps despite growing awareness.

*   **Encryption**: Improved from 47% (2022) to ~54% (2024), but progress stalled in 2025.
*   **Visibility**: Only 50% achieved centralized governance by 2025.
*   **Compliance**: 70%+ still rely on manual processes.
*   **Privacy-Enhancing Technology**: Stuck below 20% for advanced technologies.

### The Acceleration Effect

Risks no longer add—they multiply. AI uncertainty × third-party volume × compliance complexity = exponential exposure.

### Critical Actions: What Drives Success vs. What Creates Risk

| Category           | What Drives Success                                                              | What Drives Risk                                                              |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Third-Party Visibility | Know their numbers: Track exact third-party counts                               | Operate blind: 46% who don’t know partner counts also miss breaches         |
| AI Governance      | Measure AI usage: Among organizations that measure AI-generated content, 93%-96% report implementing at least one PET | Ignore AI risks: 36% unaware of AI usage have zero protections              |
| Detection Speed    | Detect fast: 43% of low-breach organizations detect in <7 days                  | Detect slowly: 31% of large ecosystems take >90 days                          |
| Investment Strategy| Invest in the middle: Apply enterprise controls at 1,000+ partners               | Underinvest at scale: 46% in danger zone lack adequate controls               |
| Security Technology| Layer defenses: Average 3.2 PETs vs. 0.8 for high-breach organizations           | Rely on basics: 36% of “don’t know” organizations use no PETs               |
| Geographic Strategy| Balance geography with technology: Use approved transfer mechanisms (53%) rather than avoiding jurisdictions (23%) | Avoid rather than adapt: The 23% avoiding jurisdictions face higher costs and limited growth |
| Architecture Approach| Invest in distributed architectures: The 29% using distributed cloud see better outcomes across all metrics | Depend solely on contracts: 20% using only contractual safeguards report worse outcomes |

The difference isn’t budget or sophistication–it’s visibility and proactive investment before disaster hits.

## Industry Variations: Not All Sectors Are Equal

### Leading the Pack

*   **Financial Services**: 63% comprehensive controls, 47% EU Data Act ready.
*   **Technology**: 42% claim fully implemented AI governance.
*   **Healthcare**: 65% “very confident” in tracking capabilities.

### Falling Behind

*   **Education**: Only 14% are prepared for EU Data Act.
*   **Legal**: 23% have no preparation plans.
*   **Government**: 58% struggle with third-party compliance.

### Moving Forward

This report provides detailed analysis, from the visibility challenge through strategic roadmaps. Whether you’re a CISO defending against AI threats, a compliance leader preparing for the EU Data Act, or a board member quantifying cyber risk, you’ll find actionable insights based on real-world data.

**Bottom Line**: In 2025, visibility determines destiny. Organizations that achieve transparency across their third-party ecosystems, AI usage, and security posture will thrive. Those operating in darkness face escalating breaches, exploding costs, and existential threats.

## Letter From the Editor

Dear Colleagues,

When we launched this report series four years ago, we aimed to track how organizations protect their most sensitive digital assets. What began with metrics like encryption rates and third-party counts has evolved into a far more complex picture—one shaped by AI proliferation, regulatory sprawl, and an explosion in third-party ecosystems.

This year’s report lays bare a critical inflection point. While a handful of organizations have embraced automation, PETs, and centralized governance, the majority remain stuck in manual processes with limited visibility—despite the existential risks they now face.

One of the most urgent insights this year is the emergence of the 1,001–5,000 third-party “danger zone.” Organizations in this category now face the worst outcomes across nearly every measure: breach frequency, detection delays, and litigation costs. These firms are caught between enterprise-level complexity and mid-market budgets—with attackers increasingly taking notice.

Meanwhile, AI governance gaps have grown more pronounced. Although 64% of organizations now track AI-generated content (up from 28% last year), only 17% have implemented technical governance frameworks. And among those unaware of their AI data exposure, 36% use no PETs at all. These blind spots are not theoretical—they’re compounding actual risk.

For the first time, we’ve introduced a proprietary risk scoring algorithm that synthesizes breach frequency, detection speed, and financial damage into a 1–10 scale. The results are sobering:

*   Organizations in the “danger zone” scored the highest average risk (5.19).
*   Those expressing the most confidence in their tracking paradoxically show higher risk scores—highlighting the overconfidence effect.
*   Firms with strong AI governance and privacy investment consistently scored lower, quantifying the real ROI of visibility and control.

Across sectors and regions, we’re also seeing diverging strategies. The most mature organizations balance distributed cloud architectures, PET deployments, and multi-jurisdictional compliance automation. Others continue to rely on contracts and employee training—strategies that are increasingly insufficient in the face of regulatory scrutiny and AI-driven threats.

The bottom line? In 2025, good enough is no longer good enough. Our research shows that exponential threats demand exponential responses. This report offers the data and frameworks to guide that transformation—including the industry’s first quantitative model for benchmarking data security risk.

Thank you for your continued partnership in this critical work.

Sincerely,

## Visibility-Governance Challenge

### What You Don’t Know Multiplies Risk

In the world of data security, there’s a fundamental truth that our four years of research has made undeniable: You cannot protect what you cannot see. Yet our 2025 data reveals that organizations across every industry, size, and geography are operating with dangerous blind spots that transform manageable risks into existential threats.

#### Compounding Effect of Unknown Unknowns

The most alarming discovery in our 2025 research is how visibility gaps cluster together. Organizations rarely have just one blind spot—unknowns breed unknowns in a cascade of expanding risk.

Our cross-tabulation analysis reveals how “don’t know” responses correlate:

*   **48%** of those who don’t know breach frequency can’t quantify litigation costs.
*   **46%** of these also don’t know their breach frequency.
*   **42%** of those uncertain about hacks report uncertainty in detection times.
*   **32%** of those uncertain about third-party exposure conduct regular audits.

![Cascade Effect: Lack of Visibility Translates Into Higher Risk.](Image description: A bar chart showing the correlation between different "don't know" responses and their impact on other risk areas.)

Our analysis reveals four primary visibility failures and their documented impacts:

| Visibility Gap              | Survey Finding                                                              |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unknown Third-Party Count   | 46% also don’t know breach frequency                                        |
| Unknown AI Data Usage       | 36% have zero PETs implemented                                              |
| Unknown Compliance Hours    | 20%–26% of various roles report “don’t know”                                |
| Unknown Detection Times     | 42% don’t know how many third parties exchange private data                 |

### Visibility Gaps Across Critical Dimensions

#### Dimension 1: Third-Party Ecosystem Visibility

The relationship between tracking confidence and security outcomes emerges clearly from our cross-analysis:

| Third-Party Volume | Expressed Confidence Level | Most Common Breach Frequency | Percentage of Organizations |
| :----------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Fewer than 500     | Very confident             | 0 breaches                   | 43%                         |
| Fewer than 500     | Somewhat confident         | 1–3 breaches                 | 38%                         |
| Fewer than 500     | Not confident              | 1+ breaches                  | 57%                         |
| 1,001–5,000        | Very confident             | 7–9 hacks                    | 42%                         |

**Key Finding**: Even high confidence cannot fully overcome the risks of ecosystem complexity.

##### Confidence vs. Complexity: Third-Party Volume Still Drives Breach Risk

1.  Confidence in tracking data alone is not a strong safeguard—even among organizations that report being “very confident” in their ability to control data exchanges, breach rates remain significant. Notably, 42% of very confident organizations with 1,001–5,000 third parties still experience 7–9 annual hacks.
2.  Ecosystem complexity drives breach exposure—organizations with fewer than 500 third parties see lower breach rates overall, especially when confidence is high. But as the number of third parties increases, even high confidence levels fail to offset the elevated risk from larger digital supply chains.

#### Dimension 2: AI Data Usage Visibility

Organizations with clear AI data visibility demonstrate dramatically better security outcomes. As detailed in our AI Governance section, measurement drives action—those who track their AI usage are significantly more likely to implement protective measures.

Understanding these third-party risks becomes even more complex when artificial intelligence enters the equation. The following figure explores how AI adoption multiplies existing vulnerabilities and creates entirely new categories of risk.

![No Business Visibility and AI Data Risk.](Image description: A complex chart showing correlations between lack of visibility in various areas (third-party volume, AI data exposure, breach history, etc.) and their impact on AI governance, EU Data Act readiness, and detection time.)

The figure reveals a strong and consistent pattern: Organizations that answered “Don’t Know” to key cybersecurity questions—such as how many third parties they work with, their breach history, litigation exposure, or breach detection time—also lack visibility and control over AI data usage. For example, 61% of those unsure about breach detection time also don’t know what percentage of data entered into public AI tools is private. Similarly, 57% of those who don’t know their third-party volume lack awareness of AI data exposure. These knowledge gaps are paired with weak controls: Only 17%–23% of these organizations have no AI usage policies, and just 23%–31% have implemented comprehensive AI governance frameworks.

Despite these visibility blind spots, concern over AI security risks remains consistently high. In every “Don’t Know” group, between 67% and 75% identified model leakage as a top concern—suggesting that organizations are aware of the threat but lack the visibility and infrastructure to address it effectively. This disconnect—between concern and action—highlights a dangerous operational gap: Visibility risks are not just technical oversights; they are indicators of broader governance failures that leave organizations vulnerable to AI-driven data loss, regulatory penalties, and reputational harm.

#### Building Visibility Infrastructure

Based on the patterns in our data, organizations achieving better outcomes share common characteristics:

| Metric Category | High Performance                               | Low Performance                               |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Third-Party Count | Exact numbers by risk tier                     | “Don’t know” or estimates                     |
| AI Data Usage   | Percentage of private data                     | No measurement                                |
| Detection Speed | Hours/days to discovery                        | Unknown or >30 days                           |
| Compliance Effort| Precise hour tracking                          | “Don’t know”                                  |
| Breach Frequency| Exact incident counts                          | Uncertain or untracked                        |

![Metrics That Matter: KPIs From the Data.](Image description: A table summarizing key performance indicators for high and low performing organizations across various metrics.)

![Power of Confidence + Control.](Image description: A comparison table showing the outcomes of high-performance vs. low-performance organizations based on confidence and control.)

The two figures above emphasize that confidence and control are driven by visibility, and that visibility, in turn, defines performance outcomes. Organizations in the “High Performance” group consistently report precise metrics across third-party volume, AI data usage, detection speed, compliance effort, and breach frequency—enabling them to detect breaches faster, reduce costs, and achieve better regulatory outcomes. In contrast, “Low Performance” organizations operate in a fog of uncertainty, often responding “Don’t Know” to critical metrics, failing to measure AI data exposure, and taking over 30 days to detect incidents. These blind spots result in higher breach rates, slower response times, and increased exposure to costs and compliance risk. The message is clear: Investing in metrics and measurement capabilities isn’t just operational best practice—it’s the foundation for resilience.

**The Difference**: Visibility drives confidence, confidence enables control.

#### Dimension 3: Compliance Process Visibility

Across industry segments, organizations report wide variance in tracking compliance effort:

![Industry Sectors and Compliance Tracking and Reporting Visibility.](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the percentage of organizations spending over 2,000 hours on compliance and the percentage responding "Don't Know" across various industry sectors.)

Having established the critical importance of visibility across all security dimensions, we now examine how this visibility challenge has evolved over time—and why incremental improvements have failed to keep pace with exponential threats.

The chart reveals stark disparities in compliance process visibility across industries. Government and Education sectors report the lowest rates of high compliance effort—just 6% in each spend over 2,000 hours—while also showing the highest levels of uncertainty, with 34% and 32% respectively saying they “don’t know” how much time is spent. In contrast, the Technology sector leads in effort transparency, with 20% spending over 2,000 hours and just 7% unsure. Healthcare strikes a more balanced profile, while Financial Services and Energy/Utilities still show one-quarter or more unsure about compliance tracking. These gaps in visibility suggest that some sectors may be underestimating both the scope and cost of compliance—raising operational and regulatory risks in industries that already face high data and privacy obligations.

![Breach Frequency and Litigation Costs.](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the percentage of organizations facing different litigation cost ranges (<$1M, $1M-$3M, $3M-$5M, >$5M) based on their annual breach frequency.)

**Critical Finding**: 48% who don’t know breach frequency also can’t quantify litigation costs.

#### Detection Delays: Time-Cost Relationships

Following are detection time distributions, with concerning patterns for larger ecosystems:

![Detection Times by Third-Party Volume.](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing the percentage of organizations taking over 30 days to detect breaches, broken down by third-party volume.)

The data highlights a clear correlation between ecosystem complexity and detection delays, as well as the compounding risk of visibility gaps. Organizations with over 1,000 third-party connections take more than 30 days to detect breaches in over half of cases (53–54%), compared to just 9% for those with fewer than 500 third parties. Alarmingly, 42% of those who don’t even know their third-party volume also exceed 30-day detection times—demonstrating how lack of oversight magnifies risk. Similarly, 48% of respondents who don’t know how many breaches they experience annually also cannot quantify litigation costs. As breach frequency increases, so do high-cost outcomes: Nearly one-third of organizations with 10+ breaches report litigation costs over $5 million. These trends underscore a core message—visibility gaps directly impair breach detection and financial risk management.

## Longitudinal Risk

### How Persistent Gaps Have Created Today’s Challenge

Note: Historical data referenced in this section is derived from previous Kiteworks annual reports.

![Persistent Gaps in Encryption and Visibility.](Image description: A line chart showing the percentage of organizations lacking comprehensive encryption and the percentage without centralized governance from 2022 to 2025.)

The data illustrates a troubling reality: Despite some year-over-year improvements in full encryption, centralized governance, and third-party inventory tracking, most organizations continue to face persistent gaps in visibility and automation. In 2025, only 56% have implemented full encryption and just over 50% have centralized governance. Meanwhile, compliance automation remains critically underdeveloped, with less than 35% adoption, and PET adoption remains stagnant at below 25%. These plateaus in progress suggest that organizations are struggling not just with implementation, but with scalability and cross-functional integration—especially as complexity grows across larger ecosystems.

#### Third Parties Remain a Risk Factor

| Year | Claimed Inadequate Third-Party Measurements | Cited No Risk Measurements for Third Parties | Said They Lack Full Third-Party Inventories | Identified Rising Risk (1,001–5,000 Third Parties) | With 5,000+ Third Parties Experienced 10+ Data Breaches |
| :--- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2021 | 51%                                       |                                            |                                            |                                                   |                                                         |
| 2022 |                                           | 58%                                        |                                            |                                                   |                                                         |
| 2023 |                                           |                                            | 67%                                        |                                                   |                                                         |
| 2024 |                                           |                                            |                                            | 44%                                               |                                                         |
| 2025 |                                           |                                            |                                            |                                                   | 24%                                                     |

While 2023 saw a peak in risk immaturity—67% of organizations lacked a full third-party inventory—by 2025, that risk appears to have shifted into breach reality: 24% of organizations with 5,000+ partners reported 10 or more annual breaches. The data also shows that 44% still lack unified encryption, and over half still lack centralized governance, despite years of awareness. These trends confirm that complexity is outpacing control, and that organizations failing to invest in foundational visibility are seeing risk compound into exposure. The convergence of incomplete encryption, fragmented governance, and low automation creates systemic vulnerabilities that cannot be resolved piecemeal.

![Year-Over-Year Risk Readiness Scorecard.](Image description: A table showing the year-over-year progress (2022-2025) of organizations in terms of full encryption, centralized governance, third-party inventory, compliance automation, and PET adoption.)

While organizations have made steady progress on foundational controls—with full encryption climbing from 47% to 56% and centralized governance reaching 50%—the pace of improvement reveals a dangerous complacency. The most alarming insight is what’s not improving: Compliance automation remains stuck below 35% after four years, creating an unsustainable burden as regulations multiply exponentially. Meanwhile, third-party inventory tracking (57%) fails to keep pace with actual ecosystem growth, meaning organizations are becoming less visible, not more. The stagnation of PET adoption at under 25% suggests that organizations have hit a complexity wall—they’ve implemented the easy solutions but lack the expertise or willingness to deploy advanced privacy technologies. This pattern—gradual progress on basics while advanced capabilities flatline—explains why 46% of organizations now face high to critical risk scores. In essence, the industry is bringing incremental improvements to an exponential fight, and the widening gap between capability and threat may soon become unbridgeable.

## Interconnected Risk

### Where AI, Partners, and Compliance Collide

Modern data security has evolved from managing discrete risks to navigating an interconnected web where threats amplify each other. Our 2025 data reveals how AI adoption, third-party relationships, and compliance requirements create compound risks that overwhelm traditional security approaches.

#### The 1,001–5,000 Third-Party “Danger Zone”

Our analysis identifies a critical inflection point in third-party risk: Organizations managing between 1,001 and 5,000 partners face the worst security outcomes across every metric.

**The Danger Zone by the Numbers**

Organizations with 1,001–5,000 third-party relationships show:

*   **24%** experience 7+ annual security incidents.
*   **46%** report highest supply chain cyber risk increases.
*   **44%** faced $3M–$5M litigation breach costs.
*   **24%** take 31–90 days to detect breaches.

**Why This Range Is Deadly**: Complex enough to overwhelm manual processes, but typically lacking the budget for enterprise-grade automated controls.

Supply chain risk increase percentages shown across the four third-party volume tiers were calculated by segmenting all survey respondents based on how many external third parties they reported working with. Within each segment—<500, 501–1,000, 1,001–5,000, and >5,000—respondents were asked whether their organization experienced a measurable increase in cybersecurity or compliance risk originating from their supply chain in the past 12 months. For each group, the percentage shown reflects the share of respondents who answered “Yes” to that question. For example, among those with 1,001–5,000 third parties, 46% reported a supply chain risk increase, while 30% of those with fewer than 500 third parties did. The formula used in each case was:

Risk Increase (%) = (Number of “Yes” responses / Total respondents in that third-party volume tier) X 100

Note: Values were then rounded to the nearest whole number to produce the final results.

![Comparing Risk Across Partner Volumes.](Image description: A table comparing risk factors (breach rate, detection time, supply chain risk increase) across different third-party volume tiers.)

The key insight from this data (Figure 13) is that supply chain risk rises steadily with ecosystem size—but not exclusively. While large ecosystems (1,001+ partners) unsurprisingly show elevated risk—46% and 43% respectively—the presence of a 30% risk increase even in organizations with fewer than 500 partners suggests that complexity alone is not the sole driver. Instead, visibility, governance, and control over even a small number of partners can be just as critical. The 501–1,000 tier, often overlooked as mid-scale, still reports a 32% risk increase, emphasizing that organizations in this range may be particularly vulnerable to outgrowing their controls without yet maturing their oversight. The trend highlights that supply chain risk is a visibility issue, not just a scale issue.

#### Why Mid-Size Complexity Kills

The danger zone emerges from a fatal combination:

*   **Security budgets** remain mid-market sized.
*   **Ecosystem complexity** rivals large companies.
*   **Visibility tools** lack sophistication.
*   **Manual processes** break under the volume.
*   **Compliance requirements** multiply with partner count.

#### Compliance Complexity in Multi-Dimensional Risk

When AI governance requirements layer onto existing regulatory obligations across thousands of third-party relationships, compliance becomes exponentially complex.

##### Keeping Pace With Regulatory Evolution

Top compliance challenges include:

*   **42%–50%** struggle with rapidly evolving regulations.
*   **33%–42%** face inconsistent multi-jurisdictional requirements.
*   **32%–46%** cannot manage third-party vendor compliance.

The EU Data Act (September 2025) exemplifies new burdens:

*   Only **22%–25%** of smaller organizations are fully prepared.
*   Financial Services leads at **47%** readiness; Education lags at **14%**.
*   Mid-size organizations face disproportionate preparation challenges.

**Multiplier Effect**: Each new regulation x number of jurisdictions x third-party count = exponential complexity.

![EU Readiness Across Industry Segments.](Image description: A bar chart showing the percentage of organizations fully ready for the EU Data Act across various industry sectors.)

The bar chart in Figure 14 reveals significant variation in industry readiness for the EU Data Act, set to take effect in September 2025. Financial Services leads the pack at 47% fully prepared, while Technology (44%) and Legal Services (30%) also show above-average readiness. In contrast, Government (19%) and Education (14%) lag substantially, highlighting the burden that regulatory compliance places on sectors with legacy infrastructure or public funding constraints. The data also reinforces the notion that private-sector industries, particularly those with strong financial or regulatory incentives, are investing more proactively in supply chain transparency and compliance infrastructure.

Figure 15 shows the distribution of company sizes among survey respondents, with large enterprises (>10,000 employees) making up half of the sample. Mid-size (1,001–5,000 employees) and small organizations (<500 employees) each account for 22%, while micro-enterprises represent the remaining 6%. This distribution adds context to the EU Data Act readiness scores: Smaller and mid-size organizations—which make up nearly half the sample—report notably lower preparation levels, often ranging between 14% and 30%. The data suggests that compliance mandates are disproportionately difficult for non-enterprise organizations, which may lack the legal, technical, and financial resources required to meet new transparency obligations.

#### When Risks Compound, Strategy Breaks

Our data shows that cybersecurity risks don’t just add up—they compound. As breach frequency increases, the impact grows exponentially. Organizations with 10+ annual breaches are more likely to report litigation costs exceeding $5 million and detection times exceeding 90 days. These delays fuel cost escalation, moving organizations from isolated incidents to sustained challenge mode—often without the governance infrastructure needed to contain it.

*   **48%** of respondents who don’t know how many breaches they’ve had also can’t quantify their breach-related costs.

#### Experience Shifts Response From Proactive to Reactive

Organizations that haven’t yet experienced a breach tend to invest in preventative controls—like encryption, compliance automation, and visibility infrastructure. But once breached, strategies shift toward damage control: legal contracts, insurance claims, and reputational defense. Motivation erodes from long-term improvement to short-term containment. This shift is especially pronounced in mid-sized organizations, which face rising breach rates but often lack the scale to absorb costs.

#### Governance Maturity = Strategy Confidence

Organizations without governance plans lean heavily on contractual risk transfer, with 25% relying on legal agreements instead of technical safeguards—often a sign they lack operational readiness. In contrast, organizations with comprehensive governance frameworks show strong adoption of advanced technical strategies: 47% use hybrid infrastructure, 46% rely on distributed cloud models, and many demonstrate confidence in managing complexity.

Notably, those planning to implement governance show forward-thinking behavior—28% are building local partnerships to support future systems. This early investment in ecosystem design signals a shift from reactive posture to proactive transformation.

Strong governance doesn’t just reduce breaches—it reshapes strategic decision-making across AI, cloud, and partner ecosystems.

## AI Governance

### Privacy-Innovation Tightrope

The AI revolution has transformed how organizations create, process, and share data. Yet our 2025 findings reveal a critical disconnect: While AI adoption races forward, governance and privacy controls lag dangerously behind.

#### Measuring AI’s Private Data Footprint

##### AI Data Awareness Drives Security Action

Organizations that measure their AI-generated private content show dramatically different security behaviors than those operating blind:

![PET Adoption by AI Measurement Capability.](Image description: A dual-axis chart showing the average number of PETs adopted and the adoption rate percentage, segmented by AI measurement capability.)

**Critical Finding**: Measurement alone drives significantly better security outcomes.

Organizations aware of their AI data usage are 93%–96% likely to implement at least one PET, while 36% of those unaware implement zero privacy protections.

Figure 17 reveals widespread AI-generated private content across organizations, yet few have strong controls or measurement in place. While only 6% report generating no AI content, nearly 60% fall into moderate to heavy usage ranges, and 17% don’t even know their exposure. Despite this, 47% of organizations unaware of their AI usage still rely on subjective user judgment to manage risk. Control mechanisms remain weak: Only 27% enforce usage limits with training or audits, and just 17% use technical controls like DLP. Meanwhile, 10% have no AI policies at all, exposing significant governance gaps in the face of rising AI adoption.

![Percentage of AI-Ingested Data Being Loaded Into Public AI LLMs.](Image description: A pie chart showing the distribution of AI-generated private content across different risk levels.)

Figure 17 underscores a critical insight: measurement drives protection. Organizations that precisely track their AI-generated content are 93%–96% more likely to implement at least one PET. In contrast, 36% of those who don’t measure implement no PETs whatsoever. Among those measuring in ranges, adoption of tools like Zero-Trust Exchange (42%), Secure Multi-Party Computation (37%), and Federated Learning (25%) is far stronger than among those in the dark. The takeaway is clear: awareness is the tipping point. Organizations that invest in visibility and governance around AI usage are substantially more capable of reducing risk, protecting private content, and aligning with compliance mandates. Measurement isn’t just a best practice—it’s the difference between security maturity and exposure.

#### When You Can’t See, You Can’t Govern

The relationship between organizational visibility and governance capability emerges as one of our most consistent findings. Organizations struggling with basic visibility metrics demonstrate dramatically weaker governance capabilities across every measure we examined. Only approximately 25% of organizations with significant visibility gaps have achieved mature AI governance, compared to over 70% among those with clear visibility into their operations.

This governance lag becomes particularly pronounced in the danger zone of 1,001–5,000 third-party relationships, where 42% lack adequate AI controls despite facing enterprise-level complexity. The temporal dimension compounds this challenge—10% of these organizations require 31–90 days to detect AI-related breaches, creating extended exposure windows where ungoverned AI usage can cause significant damage.

The correlation presents a clear causality chain: Poor visibility creates measurement gaps, which prevent effective governance implementation, ultimately leaving organizations exposed to both regulatory penalties and security breaches. This cascade effect transforms what might begin as a simple tracking deficiency into a comprehensive governance failure.

#### The Measurement Imperative: You Can’t Protect What You Don’t Measure

The foundation of effective AI governance rests on a simple principle that our data validates repeatedly: measurement drives protection. Nearly half of surveyed organizations—48%—cannot estimate how much data enters their AI systems, creating a fundamental governance gap that cascades through every aspect of their security posture.

Organizations that have invested in measuring AI data ingestion demonstrate dramatically superior protection profiles. Among those with measurement capabilities, 96% have implemented at least one privacy-enhancing technology, with 42% utilizing Zero-Trust Exchange architectures and 37% deploying Secure Multi-Party Computation. These aren’t merely compliance checkboxes but sophisticated technical controls that provide real protection against AI-specific threats.

The contrast with non-measuring organizations proves stark. Among those lacking measurement capabilities, 36% have implemented zero privacy technologies—not even basic encryption or access controls specifically for AI systems. This measurement gap extends beyond technical controls, with 64% lacking any technical AI governance mechanisms and 42% unable to determine their breach frequency. The message from our data is unequivocal: Measurement isn’t an optional first step in AI governance—it’s the foundation upon which all other protections must be built.

![AI Control Mechanisms by Visibility Level.](Image description: A stacked bar chart showing different AI control mechanisms (no specific policies, warnings without enforcement, guidelines only, training and audits, technical controls + DLP) across different visibility levels (high, medium, low/don't know).)

#### Control Paradox: Weak Enforcement Where It’s Needed Most

A counterintuitive pattern emerges when examining control mechanisms across organizations with varying visibility levels. Those with the greatest need for strong controls—organizations with limited visibility into their AI usage—paradoxically implement the weakest enforcement mechanisms.

Organizations with limited visibility, where fewer than 25% can effectively track AI usage, demonstrate a concerning reliance on passive controls. Forty percent depend primarily on warning messages without technical enforcement, while 47% rely on subjective user judgment as their primary control mechanism. Technical controls like data loss prevention or access restrictions appear in fewer than 25% of these organizations.

The contrast with high-visibility organizations proves stark. Among those with tracking capabilities exceeding 75%, we see 17% implementing comprehensive technical controls and 27% enforcing usage limits through regular audits. Perhaps most tellingly, only 10% of high-visibility organizations report having no AI policies at all, compared to nearly double that rate among their low-visibility counterparts.
