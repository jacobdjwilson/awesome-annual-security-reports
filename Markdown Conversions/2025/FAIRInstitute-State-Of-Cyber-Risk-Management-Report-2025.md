## Executive Summary
<a name="executive-summary"></a>

Conducted in May and June 2025 by the FAIR Institute with sponsorship from GuidePoint Security
and SAFE, the 2025 State of Cyber Risk Management research provides a data-driven perspective
on how mature organizations are addressing this challenge and where CRM is headed next.

Based on the responses from 402 CRM professionals around the globe, this report provides the
following key takeaways:

→ CRM is fueling business results. Top outcomes include improved alignment with the business,

greater risk reduction, and optimized cybersecurity spending.

→ Those with mature CRM programs are more proactive and business-aligned. High-maturity
organizations are more likely to have board-approved risk tolerances, quantify risk in financial
terms, embed CRM across business functions, and have a more proactive cybersecurity posture.

→ Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) and cyber risk quantification (CRQ) are gaining

momentum. Nearly 45% of organizations use or plan to use FAIR. Among adopters, 90% report

success.

→ Technology-focused C-suite decision makers benefit most. CTOs, CIOs, and CISOs, along with
Chief Risk Officers, are the primary consumers of cyber risk information, utilizing it to inform their
strategy, investments, and resource allocation.

→ Automation and AI are delivering scale and impact. Seventy-two percent of organizations have
mostly or completely automated their CRM systems, and 48% are utilizing AI for CRM. Both CRM

automation and the use of AI are strongly correlated with maturity and improved outcomes.

→ Data is foundational. Organizations use a wide variety of telemetry, threat, and compliance data

to inform their decisions. Those who can operationalize this data gain a clearer and more
defensible picture of their risk exposure.

→ Demand for CRM is growing, particularly among those with mature programs. Nearly all (95%)
respondents said internal demand for CRM is growing. Among those reporting high or very high

CRM maturity, 23% indicate that demand will increase significantly.

→ The board sets expectations for risk management but is not sufficiently engaged. Nearly all
respondents have defined risk appetite and tolerance levels that are formally approved by the
boards; however, boards consume cyber risk information in less than half of the participating

organizations.

→ Challenges and gaps remain. Cultural resistance, lack of executive support, and gaps in

governance and metrics persist even among more advanced organizations.

This report reflects a maturing discipline, one that is evolving quickly to meet business demands. As
CRM continues to integrate with enterprise strategy, those who lead with quantification, automation,
and data will be best positioned to reduce uncertainty, enable smarter decisions, and build digital

trust.

## Our Research Methodology
<a name="our-research-methodology"></a>

The 2025 State of Cyber Risk Management study was designed to explore how organizations with
established cyber risk management (CRM) programs are evolving their practices, adopting new
technologies, and aligning with business priorities. The research was developed and fielded by the
FAIR Institute in collaboration with Hanover Research.

The study focused exclusively on professionals directly involved in CRM execution, including CISOs,
risk managers, cyber risk analysts, and related roles. To ensure meaningful insights, respondents who
reported “We have no cyber risk management capabilities” were disqualified. All respondents were
required to pass a simple knowledge screener that asked, “Which of the following is the primary
purpose of conducting a cyber risk assessment in an organization?” (Correct answer: “To evaluate
the potential likelihood and impact of cyber-related losses.”)

As a result of our qualification criteria, our respondents reflect a higher level of maturity and
knowledge about CRM than we would expect from a general population of cybersecurity
professionals and organizations. This was by design.

A total of 402 qualified responses were collected in May and June 2025. Of these, 17 responses
were obtained through a survey promotion to FAIR Institute members, while the remaining responses
were sourced from a targeted panel managed by Hanover Research. Unless otherwise noted, the
data cited throughout this report reflect a sample size of 402 (i.e., n=402).

The sample was global and cross-industry, capturing perspectives from organizations of varying
sizes, sectors, and geographic regions.

The survey instrument included over 30 questions across six thematic areas:

● Cyber Risk Measurement, Maturity, & Adoption

● Challenges & Pain Points

●

Integration & Automation

● Risk-Informed Decision Making & Outcomes

● CRM Strategy & Outlook

This rigorous design ensured that the insights presented in the report reflect the practices and
perspectives of organizations that are actively managing cyber risk and leading the discipline

forward.

## The Evolution of Cyber Risk Management
<a name="the-evolution-of-cyber-risk-management"></a>

Cyber risk management (CRM) is the process of identifying, assessing, measuring, and responding[^1]
to cyber risks. Like all risk management disciplines, CRM deals with uncertainty and probabilities.
Cyber risks are a function of probable loss events and probable loss magnitudes. They depend on
the likelihood that threat actors will attempt to cause a loss, your susceptibility to those threats, and
the likely business impact should a loss event occur.

So, with all this uncertainty, why bother with CRM? The answer, as evidenced by this report, is that
understanding cyber risk improves business outcomes. Assessing loss event scenarios and
evaluating your risk factors, such as threat levels, the effectiveness of your controls, your ability to

respond in a timely manner, and the adequacy of your insurance coverage, helps you make informed
decisions and be a better cybersecurity leader.

CRM was rarely captured in literature a little over two decades ago. Now, CRM has since evolved into
a formalized discipline defined and codified in numerous industry standards and regulatory

frameworks, including ISO/IEC 27005, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the SEC Cybersecurity
Disclosure Rule, and the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act. Sometimes referred to as
cybersecurity risk management[^2] or information security risk management[^3], CRM is increasingly
regarded as an element of due care under prevailing case law in many jurisdictions.

Yet the risk management demands put upon cybersecurity leaders are evolving faster than the
standards and regulations that mandate their CRM programs. CRM must deliver cost-effective risk

reduction in a world of rapid change. Hence, the question cybersecurity leaders must ask is how to
manage cyber risk cost-effectively, at scale, and at the pace of their business. Our research explores
this question.

Our data highlights an important shift: organizations are moving beyond traditionally static and

qualitative CRM approaches to more continuous, business-aligned programs featuring cyber
risk quantification (CRQ). The more mature programs utilize automation, including AI, telemetry, and
process integration, to enhance their operations. And they are better at driving business outcomes,

such as greater risk reduction, optimized cybersecurity spending and budget justification, and
improved credibility of the cybersecurity team and trust of internal business partners.

[^1]: Responding to cyber risks, or risk response, is sometimes called risk treatment.

## Those with CRM Programs Show Moderate or Better Maturity
<a name="those-with-crm-programs-show-moderate-or-better-maturity"></a>

To understand the practices, systems, data, outcomes, gaps, and challenges of individuals with CRM
programs, we screened survey respondents for specific characteristics. These included familiarity
with their organization’s CRM practices, their job function (role) and department being pertinent to
CRM, as well as other factors described in the section above, “Our Research Methodology.” We
disqualified any who reported that they had no CRM capabilities.

Therefore, our sample represents organizations that likely have established CRM programs. None of

our respondents reported low maturity, as shown in the following table:

Survey Question: How mature would you rate your organization’s cyber risk management capabilities overall?

| Maturity Level | % of Total |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Low maturity (i.e., we are in the early stages of our program or have not matured much from our starting point) | 0% |
| Moderate maturity (i.e., we have a regular cadence for CRM processes and are regularly delivering value to our department or company) | 26% |
| High maturity (i.e., we have a regular cadence for CRM processes, have developed advanced reporting and analytics, and are delivering significant value to our department and our company) | 31% |
| Very high maturity (i.e., our CRM program is an integral part of how we plan, operate, and transform our company’s technologies) | 43% |

The higher level of maturity reflected in our data is encouraging but should not be misinterpreted as
the state of CRM maturity in the general population. Indeed, CRM maturity itself is not the headline of
this report. Instead, we often use this data to segment other factors in the report and show where

maturity correlates with different metrics.

Throughout this report, we often refer to those respondents reporting “moderate maturity” as “lower

maturity” and those with “high maturity” or “very high maturity” as “higher maturity” for ease of
comprehension. In some cases, we will refer to each maturity level separately.

## Cyber Risk Leaders Prioritize Business-Aligned Outcomes
<a name="cyber-risk-leaders-prioritize-business-aligned-outcomes"></a>

CRM is tied to business priorities. When asked which outcomes matter most, respondents
identified financial impact and cost management, risk reduction, and compliance with
regulations/standards as their top three priorities. Business-aligned cybersecurity was also highly
rated. This underscores that CRM isn’t just a technical process; it’s a strategic discipline that helps
organizations drive business performance and resilience.

Survey Question: How important are the following drivers of cyber risk management at your organization?

![Image description]

As boards and executives increasingly demand risk transparency in business terms, organizations
that can translate cyber risk into financial impact are gaining a strategic advantage. They are better

able to align cybersecurity investments with business priorities, optimize resource allocation, and
respond confidently to emerging threats and regulatory expectations, outcomes that are more
important in today’s more turbulent economic conditions.

> CISOs increasingly must think about enabling the business while protecting it. Cyber
risk management, particularly when quantified based on FAIR, offers an effective
mechanism for grounding our risk decisions in business outcomes.

## Cyber Risk Management Creates Value
<a name="cyber-risk-management-creates-value"></a>

CRM is delivering clear business value. Rather than operating in isolation, our data show that CRM is

helping organizations achieve outcomes that align directly with their enterprise goals of risk
reduction, strategic alignment, and budget optimization. CRM is no longer just a compliance
mandate.

Survey Question: What business outcomes has cyber risk management been most helpful in driving at your

organization? Select up to three (3).

![Image description]

We also found that CRM maturity matters, but even moderate maturity delivers outcomes.
Respondents reporting higher CRM maturity were significantly more likely to report the following
among their top three business outcomes compared to those with lower maturity ratings.

Survey Question: What business outcomes has cyber risk management been most helpful in driving at your
organization? Select up to three (3). [Segmented by CRM maturity level.]

| Business Outcome | % Selecting Among Top Three |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  | Lower Maturity | Higher Maturity |
| Alignment of cybersecurity resources with business priorities | 38% | 41% |
| Greater risk reduction for the organization | 33% | 42% |
| Optimized cybersecurity spending | 27% | 38% |
| Improved credibility of the cybersecurity team | 24% | 37% |

## CRM Maturity Shifts Cybersecurity Posture
<a name="crm-maturity-shifts-cybersecurity-posture"></a>

CRM is also shifting how organizations approach cybersecurity at a strategic level. The data shows a

clear relationship between CRM maturity and a proactive cybersecurity posture. Organizations
reporting higher maturity are significantly more likely to describe their cybersecurity efforts as more
proactive.

Survey Question: Are your organization’s cybersecurity efforts more proactive or reactive? [Segmented by
CRM maturity level.].

![Image description]

Based on our observations, mature organizations can anticipate threats and mitigate vulnerabilities
before they manifest rather than simply responding to incidents. As CRM capabilities grow through

better data, automation, integration, and decision support, so does the ability to manage cyber risk

as a dynamic business challenge rather than a static compliance issue.

> As a CISO, I’ve seen firsthand how maturity transforms cybersecurity from a checklist
exercise into a dynamic part of business strategy. Proactive risk management gives us
the ability to anticipate threats, support smarter decisions, and stay aligned with the
speed of the business. I’m not surprised the research bears this out. Our opportunity
now is to deepen our partnerships across the business to deliver solutions that
balance protection with agility, customer experience, and growth.

## FAIR Success Leads to Better Outcomes
<a name="fair-success-leads-to-better-outcomes"></a>

FAIR is the industry-leading approach to cyber risk quantification and the only open standard for
CRQ. According to our data, awareness of FAIR among respondents is nearly universal, at 99%, and
adoption levels are strong: 24% currently use FAIR, with another 22% planning to adopt it. Among
those who have implemented FAIR, 90% report being successful[^4] with it.

Beyond its openness, what sets FAIR apart is its impact. Organizations that are very successful with
FAIR report better business outcomes than those relying on other approaches, including non-FAIR
cyber risk quantification approaches. Indeed, financial quantification alone does not appear to
significantly alter business outcomes, per our data, as shown below.

Survey Question: What business outcomes has cyber risk management been most helpful in driving at your
organization? Select up to three (3). [Segmented by CRQ approach / success.]

| Top 3 Business Outcome | All Respondents | Financial Quantifiers | Very Successful with FAIR |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Greater risk reduction for the organization | 40% | 41% | 54% |
| Improved credibility of cybersecurity team / trust of internal business partners | 56% | 53% | 77% |
| Optimized cybersecurity spending / budget justification | 58% | 59% | 65% |

CRQ is also on the rise more broadly. 31% of respondents report primarily using a quantitative
approach to CRM, all of whom quantify cyber risk in monetary terms. This indicates a clear shift

toward a financial framing of cyber risk.

> What sets FAIR apart are the decades of community involvement and refinement.
Over the years, the methodology has been proven in real-world scenarios; that's why
the business outcomes with FAIR greatly exceed those of other approaches.

— Mark Tomallo, Fortune 500 CISO and FAIR Institute Board Director

[^4]: The level of success was self-reported by respondents, with options being “Very unsuccessful, “Somewhat unsuccessful,”
“Neutral,” “Somewhat successful,” and “Very successful.”

## The Technology C-Suite Benefits the Most
<a name="the-technology-c-suite-benefits-the-most"></a>

One of the clearest signs of CRM’s evolution is its direct support for executive and board-level

decision-making. After all, the C-suite and board are accountable for enterprise risk management
(ERM), encompassing cyber risks. Accountability begins with setting expectations for cyber risk.
Nearly all respondents have defined risk appetite and tolerance levels (99%) and had them
formally approved by the board (90%).

CRM also improves executive awareness and decision-making, primarily among those in technology-
focused roles. C-suite tech leaders are the primary consumers of cyber risk information, utilizing
it to inform their strategy, investments, and resource allocation.

On the other hand, boards appear largely split in their use of risk insights. This may be due to the

number of organizations that do not quantify risk in financial terms (nearly 70%). Financial
quantification translates technical risk information into meaningful terms for board members from
any background. As more organizations adopt financial quantification, we expect corporate boards

to become better informed.

Business unit and product leaders also remain much less likely to engage with CRM outputs,
highlighting an opportunity for further use of cyber risk information when making line-of-business
decisions.

Survey Question: What roles/offices at your organization are using cyber risk information? Select all that apply.

| Offices/Roles Using Cyber Risk Information | % of Total |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Chief Technology Officer (CTO) | 94% |
| Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | 92% |
| Chief Information Officer (CIO) | 87% |
| Chief Risk Officer (CRO) | 76% |
| Chief Financial Officer (CFO) | 62% |
| Legal / General Counsel | 58% |
| Board of Directors | 45% |
| Business Units / Product Leadership | 6% |

The alignment between CRM and technology executive decision-making not only strengthens
oversight but also enables organizations to operate within clearly articulated and board-sanctioned
risk boundaries. However, greater involvement of the board and line-of-business leadership will

enhance risk outcomes, including business alignment and optimized cybersecurity spending.

## CRM Is Integrated with Enterprise Risk
<a name="crm-is-integrated-with-enterprise-risk"></a>

As cyber risk grows in scope and consequence, integrating CRM into broader ERM frameworks is

essential. Leading standards such as the NIST Interagency Report (IR) 8286 series explicitly call for
this alignment, urging organizations to treat cyber risk as a core component of enterprise risk
analysis, reporting, and governance.

Our survey findings support this trajectory. Nearly all respondents communicate cyber risks to ERM,
while nearly four in ten both communicate and manage cyber risks together with enterprise risks.
This is a key marker of maturity, as integration fosters shared risk language, clearer accountability,
and better-informed executive decisions.

Survey Question: What best describes how cyber risks are integrated into enterprise risk management at your
organization?

| Integration of Cyber Risks with Enterprise Risk Management | % of Total |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Organization does not have an enterprise or corporate risk management function | 0% |
| Cyber risks are not communicated to enterprise risk management | 1% |
| Cyber risks are communicated to enterprise risk management but managed separately from other enterprise risks | 61% |
| Cyber risks are communicated to enterprise risk management and are managed together with enterprise risks | 38% |

This convergence ensures that cyber risk is evaluated alongside financial, operational, reputational,
and strategic risks, enabling organizations to:

● Prioritize cybersecurity investments based on enterprise impact
● Align cybersecurity goals with business strategy
● Facilitate board-level oversight of technology risk

As regulations continue to emphasize board accountability and risk transparency, integration
between CRM and ERM is quickly becoming a hallmark of high-performing organizations.

## Organizations Tackle Third-Party Cyber Risk
<a name="organizations-tackle-third-party-cyber-risk"></a>

As digital ecosystems become increasingly complex, third-party cyber risk has become a strategic

concern, prompting organizations to respond accordingly. Every respondent in this year’s survey
indicated that their CRM programs extend to their third-party risk processes, with 64% applying
CRM strictly and 36% doing so loosely (informally). However, the maturity of third-party CRM
appears lower, with fewer respondents (62%) rating their third-party CRM as high or very high
maturity, compared to the portion (81%) who did the same for first-party CRM.

Organizations report a wide range of benefits from third-party cyber risk management, as shown in
the following table.

Survey Question: What business outcomes have your third-party cyber risk management processes been
most helpful in driving at your organization? Select up to three (3).

| Integration of Cyber Risks with Enterprise Risk Management | % of Total |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Better alignment between procurement, security, and legal functions | 30% |
| Greater visibility into critical third-party dependencies and risks | 26% |
| Increased trust with customers, partners, and regulators | 24% |
| Reduced residual risk from high-impact third-party relationships | 24% |
| Enhanced scalability of third-party risk management through automation or tiering | 24% |
| Stronger negotiating position with vendors regarding security obligations | 19% |
| Improved response time to third-party cyber incidents | 17% |
| Improved risk-based prioritization of vendor assessments | 16% |
| Higher assurance of business continuity across critical vendors | 16% |
| Strengthened contractual protections related to cybersecurity and data privacy | 15% |
| Increased confidence in vendor onboarding and renewal decisions | 14% |
| Improved executive and board reporting on vendor-related cyber risks | 14% |
| Reduced frequency of vendor-related security incidents or data breaches | 13% |
| Enhanced ability to meet regulatory and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, DORA) | 7% |

## CRM Programs Automate as They Mature
<a name="crm-programs-automate-as-they-mature"></a>

Cyber risk management is no longer a manual process. According to this year’s findings, 72% of

organizations have mostly (61%) or completely (12%) automated their CRM systems, while another
26% use a blend of manual and automated systems.

The use of automation is strongly correlated with CRM maturity. The table below shows the

percentage of respondents, by degree of automation, who rated themselves as moderate, high or
very high maturity.

Survey Question: Are your organization’s current cyber risk management systems manual or automated?
[Segmented by CRM maturity.]

| CRM Maturity | Degree of CRM System Automation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  | Moderate | High | Very High |
| Mostly or completely automated | 0% | 9% | 91% |
| Even mix of manual and automated | 1% | 21% | 78% |
| Mostly or completely manual | 6% | 60% | 34% |

To improve automation, organizations are increasingly turning to purpose-built CRM tools, also
known as CRQ solutions. The majority (56%) rely on special-purpose CRM software[^5], outpacing
the use of general-purpose GRC platforms[^6] (24%), cybersecurity vendor[^7] add-ons (19%), and
custom-built solutions (2%)[^8]. This shift toward specialized platforms reflects the growing demand for
solutions tailored to cyber risk workflows, quantification, and third-party integration capabilities,

which are not typically offered by legacy GRC tools.

> CRQ solutions today look very different from CRQ solutions two years ago, and they
cover entirely new territory than they did when they were first introduced…Now,
advances in automation, UX, and integrations, coupled with better industry loss data
and threat intelligence, have ushered CRQ solutions into a new era. CRQ solutions
address several governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) use cases that bridge the gap
between risk and security operations.

## CRM Automation Improves Business Outcomes
<a name="crm-automation-improves-business-outcomes"></a>

Automation isn’t just becoming more widespread, its use is effective for driving the most essential
outcomes cited earlier in this report. Survey data shows a strong correlation between higher levels of
automation and improved business outcomes across the board.

As shown in the following table, organizations that have mostly or completely automated their CRM
systems were more likely to cite the essential outcomes among their top three.

Survey Questions: What business outcomes [has cyber risk management] | [have your third-party cyber risk
management processes] been most helpful in driving at your organization? Select up to three (3). [Segmented
by degree of CRM system automation.]

| Business Outcome | Partial Automation | High Automation |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Greater risk reduction | 36% | 41% |
| More optimized cybersecurity spending | 32% | 37% |
| Better alignment across security, legal, and procurement | 18% | 34% |
| Improved scalability in third-party risk management | 14% | 28% |
| Reduced residual risk from high-impact third parties | 17% | 26% |

In short, automation goes hand in hand with essential business outcomes for CRM programs that
may otherwise struggle to keep pace with their businesses.

## Programs Integrate with Non-Cyber Operations
<a name="programs-integrate-with-non-cyber-operations"></a>

Cyber risk management is no longer confined to security teams; it’s increasingly embedded across
the operational fabric of the enterprise. Our data shows that organizations are integrating CRM into a
diverse array of business and IT functions, reflecting its growing role in day-to-day decision-making
and governance.

The most common integration points are technical, involving IT asset management, configuration
management, and IT service management (e.g., ticketing and resolution processes). However, CRM is
also extending into core business disciplines such as finance and accounting, legal and compliance,
and vendor/supply management.

Survey Question: What best describes how cyber risks are integrated into enterprise risk management at your
organization?

| Operational Process or Discipline Integrated with CRM | % of Total |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| IT asset management/configuration management | 96% |
| IT service management (e.g., ticketing, resolution) | 95% |
| Finance and accounting | 81% |
| Legal and compliance | 77% |
| Vendor/supply chain management | 40% |
| Product development/management | 29% |
| Change management | 16% |
| Human resources | 15% |

Clearly, integration with product development, supply chain, and HR is still emerging. Given the
importance of third-party cyber risk management (as discussed earlier), we expected to see
vendor/supply chain management integration at a greater rate. As product development and other
business changes often introduce or alter cyber risks for the enterprise, we would like to see tighter

integration with those processes as well. Finally, in light of insider risk management programs (e.g.,
background checks) and security awareness initiatives, we expected to see more CRM-HR

collaboration.

Despite opportunities for improvement, the pattern is clear: CRM is becoming an operational
discipline across the organization, shifting from a siloed risk practice to a shared enterprise
responsibility.

## Data Is the Lifeblood of Cyber Risk Management
<a name="data-is-the-lifeblood-of-cyber-risk-management"></a>

Cyber risk is fundamentally a problem of uncertainty. Effective CRM programs reduce that
uncertainty by grounding decisions in measurable inputs, starting with data from commonly
deployed cybersecurity tools. As shown here, organizations utilize a diverse range of data sources to
inform their CRM decisions. The breadth of data inputs reflects both the complexity of the threat
landscape and the growing maturity of CRM practices.

Survey Question: What data does your organization regularly use for cyber risk management? Select all that
apply.

| Data Sources Used for CRM | % of Respondents |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Endpoint security data | 78% |
| Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data | 77% |
| Compliance audit results | 76% |
| SIEM data and/or network traffic logs | 66% |
| Vulnerability assessment findings | 65% |
| Incident response records | 61% |
| Cloud management systems (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) | 44% |
| Third-party risk assessments | 39% |
| Asset data (e.g., CMDB) | 35% |
| User access logs | 32% |
| Vulnerability assessment reports | 32% |
| Penetration testing / red teaming results | 24% |
| Product/service definitions | 21% |

The more data CRM programs can draw upon, the better they can assess likelihoods, model impact,
prioritize mitigation efforts, and communicate findings in business-relevant terms. As CRM has

become increasingly quantitative and integrated, data is an indispensable component of CRM
systems and programs.

## AI Is Not Limited to Experimental Use
<a name="ai-is-not-limited-to-experimental-use"></a>

Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a core component of CRM and is not just an emerging

technology. This year’s data shows that 48% of organizations already use AI for CRM, while 34% are
actively experimenting, and yet another 16% plan to adopt AI. Of those experimenting with or
planning to adopt AI for CRM, 61% expect to do so within the next 12 months.

We must interpret this data cautiously: it does not reveal exactly how organizations are using AI for
CRM. In our experience, AI is often used for underlying capabilities such as threat detection, incident
response, malware analysis, vulnerability management, and attack surface monitoring. AI is also
supporting third-party risk management by processing unstructured data such as vendor contracts,
SOC2 reports, and questionnaire responses, sometimes to populate CRQ models. However, its use
for CRQ and other core aspects of CRM appears to be emerging and net yet well established.

In our data, AI adoption is strongly correlated with CRM maturity. Organizations using AI report
significantly higher levels of maturity across nearly every major CRM capability, from first-party and
third-party risk management to cyber risk mitigation, disclosure, and board reporting. AI users also

demonstrate a more proactive cybersecurity posture. 91% of organizations using AI describe their
approach as slightly more proactive or much more proactive than reactive, compared to just 62% of
non-AI users. These findings suggest that AI is accelerating CRM workflows and reshaping how

organizations identify, respond to, and communicate cyber risk.

> AI is fast becoming a pervasive enabler of innovation and productivity. But the speed
at which businesses are now innovating and the uncertainties it brings are creating
new challenges for CISOs. It's great to see that CISOs and risk teams are increasingly
utilizing AI to better manage cyber risk. Since this often involves working with
unstructured data and complex data relationships, AI is well-suited to many cyber risk
tasks. Businesses should continue to embrace AI where they can get an edge, as our
adversaries certainly will be doing so.

## Challenges and Gaps Persist
<a name="challenges-and-gaps-persist"></a>

Even among organizations with established cyber risk management programs, obstacles often
remain. The three most cited challenges or gaps are poor communication between departments
(37%), resistance from peers and stakeholders (34%), and a lack of executive commitment or
prioritization (33%).

Those organizational issues are far more common than technical issues such as lack of reliable
threat intelligence (19%) and inadequate third-party control data (15%), or resource constraints
such as insufficient resources and budget allocation (10%) or inadequate analyst skills (9%).

When it comes to gaps and challenges, there are some areas where maturity matters more than
others. The following table reveals the barriers where lower CRM maturity increases their likelihood

more dramatically.
