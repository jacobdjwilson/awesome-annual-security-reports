## Introduction by Patrick Joyce, global resident CISO, Proofpoint
2025: CISOs navigate another turbulent year

Over the years, the cybersecurity industry has witnessed the rise and fall of countless buzzwords—from “cloud computing” to “zero trust.” While these concepts often begin as trends, they quickly become deeply embedded in how organizations conduct business.

Today, the standout term dominating headlines and boardroom conversations alike is artificial intelligence (AI). Once considered an abstract concept, AI is now firmly entrenched in the daily operations of enterprises across the globe. In the cybersecurity realm, we’re seeing AI radically transform both the tactics of cyberdefenders and the techniques of malicious actors.

As a result, CISOs are faced with a dual responsibility: integrating AI technologies to enhance security posture, while also ensuring responsible and ethical use throughout the organization. Misuse or unchecked implementation can open the door to data leaks, regulatory violations, and reputational harm.

Yet, as with any major technological shift, the introduction of AI brings not only new risks but also new opportunities. CISOs are increasingly called upon to strike a balance between innovation and risk mitigation—a position that places them at the forefront of strategic business decision-making.

But AI is just one force reshaping the role of today’s CISO. As threats grow more complex and enterprise environments become more demanding, many organizations are rethinking the structure of the CISO position altogether. Some are splitting responsibilities across multiple roles, while others are expanding the scope to include broader technology leadership. What’s clear is that the role of the CISO is evolving—rapidly and continuously.

In this year’s Voice of the CISO report, Proofpoint surveyed 1,600 CISOs at organizations with 1,000 or more employees worldwide. We explored their priorities, challenges and expectations for the next two years—from persistent threats like data sprawl and human error to growing concerns around burnout and boardroom alignment.

This report offers a comprehensive snapshot of the modern CISO experience, shaped by the voices of global security leaders. We thank all participants for their time, candor and valuable insights.

## Chapter 1: Confidence clashes with concern
On the back of yet more high-profile breaches and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks so far this year, it should come as little surprise that CISOs are concerned about the increasing threat landscape and its potential impact on their business.

More than three-quarters (76%) feel their company is at risk of a material cyberattack within the next 12 months, with just over a third (36%) believing it to be “highly likely“. This is a notable increase from the 70% and 31% who shared the respective sentiments last year.

76% believe their company is at risk of experiencing a material cyberattack in the next 12 months, with 36% considering it highly likely.

![Bar chart showing the likelihood of experiencing a material cyberattack in the next 12 months. Global average for 2025 is 76%, up from 70% in 2024. India is highest at 90% (2025) followed by Germany (88%) and Brazil (86%); the lowest is France (56%). Other countries shown include United States (80%), Netherlands (84%), Australia (82%), Mexico (82%), Saudi Arabia (81%), Singapore (80%), Canada (77%), Italy (73%), United Arab Emirates (69%), Japan (69%), United Kingdom (63%), and Spain (59%).](image-1-likelihood-of-material-cyberattack)

We do not have to look far for potential factors behind this growing concern. Of the CISOs surveyed for this year’s report, two-thirds (66%) indicated that they experienced a material loss of sensitive information within the past 12 months. This is a marked increase from just 46% the previous year.

That said, several countries came in considerably higher than this worldwide average. A staggering 99% of Indian CISOs reported the loss of sensitive data, followed by Singapore (91%) and Brazil (85%), while Spain is the lowest at 33%. Across verticals, financial services was the highest at 87%, and education was the lowest at 29%.

In addition to these increased statistics, over half (58%) of global CISOs agree that their organization is unprepared for a cyberattack in 2025. Once again, this represents an increase, up from 43% last year. Canada ranked the highest (76%); Spanish CISOs showed more confidence, with only 33% agreeing they are not ready to weather a targeted attack in the year to come.

However, while growing CISO concern may be easy to understand, the collective view of their own organization’s cyberposture is more difficult to square away. Over two-thirds (67%) of global CISOs agree that their overall cybersecurity culture is strong, Mexico topping the chart at 82% and Spain the lowest at 43%.

67% of global CISOs agree that their organization's overall cybersecurity culture is strong, followed by financial services (79%), media, leisure, and entertainment (79%) and healthcare (78%); the lowest is retail and business services (both 64%).

Other countries shown include United States (77%), Netherlands (81%), Australia (77%), Mexico (76%), Saudi Arabia (74%), Canada (74%), Italy (61%), Germany (60%), United Arab Emirates (52%), Japan (43%), United Kingdom (42%), and France (35%).](image-2-material-loss-of-sensitive-information)

The disconnect between confidence and concern suggests CISOs feel they are on the wrong side of a losing battle. If cyberculture is robust, but attacks are likely, are breaches now considered inevitable regardless of the defenses that are put in place?

> “This year’s findings highlight a striking duality: The increase in CISOs expecting a material attack speaks volumes about the evolving threat landscape. It is clear that many security leaders view a breach not as a possibility, but as a near inevitability. The challenge now lies in transforming confidence into resilience, ensuring that preparedness is more than a perception.”

## Chapter 2: Attacks from all angles
After an assessment of the threat landscape, it’s clear today’s CISOs have plenty of reasons for concern. When asked what they perceived to be the biggest cybersecurity threat to their organization, this year’s survey respondents failed to reach a consensus.

Unsurprisingly, email fraud (37%) sits atop the growing inventory of CISO concerns, as it has since our first report was published in 2021. However, insider threats (37%), ransomware (36%), cloud account takeover (34%), malware (33%) and supply chain attacks (33%) now occupy attention in almost equal measures.

While many share similar concerns, the primary threat likely causing sleepless nights among CISOs differs around the world. Email fraud is a top concern among those in the U.S., UK, Italy and the UAE, while supply chain threats top the list in India, Singapore and Canada.

Insider threats topped the list of concerns for companies with 5,000+ employees. Education views ransomware (63%) and malware (56%) as the highest threats and insiders as the least threatening (26%). Media/leisure is above average for insider threats (51%). Saudi Arabia considers insider threats the biggest risk (50%), more so than any other country surveyed. Malware is of least concern in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Singapore and the UK.

![Bar chart showing the biggest cybersecurity threats perceived by CISOs for their organization/industry in the next 12 months. Respondents could pick up to three.
- Email fraud (business email compromise): 37%
- Insider threat (Careless, compromised, or malicious): 37%
- Ransomware attacks: 36%
- Cloud account takeover/compromise (Microsoft 365 or G suite or other): 34%
- Malware: 33%
- Supply chain attacks: 33%
- Other: 3%
- I do not predict there to be any biggest cybersecurity threats within my organization/industry in the next 12 months: 1%](image-3-biggest-cybersecurity-threats)

### Varied attacks. Same consequence.
The wide array of threats troubling CISOs this year may differ in their tactics and procedures, but the outcome is nearly always the same. Whether caused by a careless insider, a spoofed email, malicious payload or compromised supplier, the end result is the same: data loss.

That so many threats of concern to CISOs share this same end goal demonstrates just how much pressure security teams are under to identify and keep sensitive data where it belongs.

So much so, that should it fall into the wrong hands, many are willing to engage with cybercriminals to do what it takes to get it back. Two-thirds (66%) of CISOs said their organization would be likely to pay a ransom to restore systems or prevent the release of data by an attacker.

CISOs in Canada (84%) and Mexico (84%) are among the most willing, while those in Spain (51%) are the least prepared to pay.

Industries:
- Transportation
- Media
- Business and professional services

Top three countries prepared to pay a ransom:
- Canada (84%)
- Mexico (84%)
- U.S. (76%)

If impacted by ransomware within the next 12 months, my organization is likely to pay a ransom to restore systems or prevent the release of data.

> “The breadth of threats facing organizations today underscores the need for a holistic security strategy. From insider threats and email fraud to ransomware and supply chain vulnerabilities, every entry point demands equal scrutiny. The reality is that effective cyberdefense today requires both broad visibility and rapid adaptability.”

> No single attack vector dominates, and this diversification of risk is forcing CISOs to remain vigilant on all fronts.

## Chapter 3: Data sprawl vs. data security
Data sprawl has been a mounting challenge for organizations for many years. The more data we create, move, process and store every day, the harder it is to classify, track and secure. However, recent developments have only compounded the issue.

The rise and rapid adoption of LLMs and GenAI apps, such as ChatGPT, has changed the playing field, making it much easier to create, share, save and potentially expose information in the shadows. CISOs are certainly not oblivious to this threat. Over two-thirds (67%) see information protection and governance as a top priority.

Mexico ranked the highest at 86%, followed by Australia (84%) and Canada (82%), with the UK the lowest at 53%.

Any concerns that a third of global CISOs are not prioritizing data protection to a higher degree are quickly allayed by the finding that 98% of organizations indicate that they have a data loss prevention (DLP) program in place. That said, 61% have only implemented technological protections, while 31% bolster this with part-time resources, and just 6% have dedicated DLP resources at their disposal.

2/3 of global CISOs (67%) see information protection and governance as a top priority.

![Pie chart showing responses to "Does your organization have a data loss prevention (DLP) program in place?".
- Yes (Net): 98%
  - Yes, Technology only: 61%
  - Yes, Technology and part-time resources: 31%
  - Yes, Technology and dedicated resources: 6%
- No: 2%](image-4-data-loss-prevention-program)

Aside from DLP taking first place, other common technological solutions include cloud security (30%), data security posture management (DSPM) (29%), web security and/or browser isolation (28%) and insider risk management (28%).

71% of CISOs in the education sector said they have DLP technology in place, the highest across all industries. Saudi, Germany and Mexico rank highest for DLP implementation. Only 23% of French CISOs said they have DLP technology in place, followed by Singapore (24%) and India (25%).

![Bar chart showing technologies in place to combat organizational data loss. Respondents could pick all that apply.
- Data loss prevention (DLP): 35%
- Employee awareness training: 30%
- Email security: 28%
- Cloud security (e.g., Cloud DLP/CASB): 29%
- Data security posture management (DSPM): 28%
- Web security and/or browser isolation (e.g., Web DLP): 27%
- Insider risk management: 28%
- Endpoint security (e.g., Endpoint DLP): 26%
- Other: 2%
- We don't have any specific data loss technologies: 0%](image-5-data-loss-technologies)

As to whether data protection programs are up to muster, feelings are mixed. Just two-thirds of CISOs surveyed indicated that the data within their organization is adequately protected despite almost all having DLP technologies in place. Those in the U.S. and Mexico are most confident (81%) while Spain’s CISOs express the most concern (45%).

Whatever they feel about the effectiveness of their protections, CISOs are right to be worried about the impact of data loss. Of the 66% that experienced a loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months, regulatory sanctions, post-recovery costs, reputational damage and credential theft topped the list of consequences which they experienced.

### Data doesn't walk out the door by itself
![Bar chart showing the end result of data loss events on organizations (respondents whose organization dealt with material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months). Respondents could pick all that apply.
- Regulatory sanctions (fines or market loss/sanctions): 34%
- Post-attack recovery costs (Operational downtime, data recovery, legal or other): 32%
- Reputational damage: 31%
- Loss of critical data: 29%
- Financial loss: 27%
- Credential theft: 27%
- Loss of customers: 15%
- Other: 2%](image-6-end-result-of-data-loss-event)

Only 15% of healthcare orgs that experienced a data breach resulted in loss of critical data. Data breaches at 42% of IT firms resulted in regulatory sanctions, higher than finserv (32%), healthcare (32%) and government (38%). Mexico was highest (50%) on post-attack recovery costs followed by UAE (47%). Mexico (45%), the Netherlands (40%) and Japan (40%) were above global average on regulatory sanctions. Only 9% of French organizations lost customers due to data loss.

These findings raise a pressing question. If almost all organizations have some form of DLP strategy in place, why have the majority experienced data loss and other associated consequences? Once again, we do not have to look far to find an answer.

Of the primary causes of data loss events, the top three–malicious/criminal insiders, careless insiders and compromised insiders–are all people and behavioral-driven. Data doesn’t lose itself. People lose it, intentionally or unintentionally.

92% of CISOs said that employees leaving their organization played a role in a data loss event, up from 73% last year.

![Bar chart showing the root cause of data loss events (respondents whose organization dealt with material loss of sensitive information in the past 12 months). Respondents could pick all that apply.
- Malicious or criminal insider (An employee that misuses data to intentionally harm the organization): 34%
- Careless insider (An employee who unknowingly misuses data): 33%
- Compromised insider (An employee whose credentials were stolen): 32%
- External attack (Cybercriminal or nation-state): 32%
- Third-party compromise attack: 30%
- Misuse of GenAI tools: 27%
- Lost/stolen devices: 27%
- Other: 1%
- Do not know: 0%](image-7-root-cause-of-data-loss-event)

> “Despite near-universal adoption of DLP programs, material data loss remains alarmingly common. As data becomes increasingly distributed and easily shared—particularly through GenAI-enabled platforms— traditional controls are struggling to keep pace. To protect sensitive information in 2025 and beyond, organizations must evolve from static protection to dynamic, context-aware security.”

## Chapter 4: The people problem persists
As anxiety over potential cyberattacks increases, there's also growing consensus on the leading risk factor: people. With a rise in insider threats and data loss driven by human actions, CISOs around the world (66%) agree that human risk is their organization’s greatest cyber vulnerability across the board.

Of course, the people problem is nothing new. Users have been a contributing factor in most cyberattacks for many years now. That a majority of CISOs (68%) believe their employees have a strong understanding of cybersecurity best practices in spite of this, however, is altogether more surprising.

Employees who truly understand their role in protecting an organization and demonstrate that understanding through appropriate behavior, cannot also be the biggest risk their organization faces.

68% of global CISOs believe employees have a strong understanding of data security best practices and their role in protecting the organization against cyberthreats.

![Bar chart showing the percentage of CISOs in agreement that human error is their organization's biggest cyber vulnerability. Global average for 2025 is 66%.
- Australia: 88%
- Brazil: 78%
- Italy: 77%
- India: 75%
- Singapore: 72%
- Spain: 71%
- Mexico: 68%
- Canada: 67%
- United States: 63%
- Germany: 61%
- Japan: 60%
- United Kingdom: 57%
- Saudi Arabia: 57%
- United Arab Emirates: 56%
- France: 53%
- Netherlands: 49%](image-8-human-error-biggest-cyber-vulnerability)

When we delve deeper into how CISOs assess cybersecurity understanding, things become a bit clearer. Despite the role of people in cyberattack and data loss, employee security awareness training is way down the priority list for CISOs when asked to list technologies they have in place to combat organizational data loss.

If people are not regularly trained and assessed on their understanding of —and reactions to— the types of threats they are likely to face, and when and where they are likely to face them, they cannot possibly appreciate the extent of their role in keeping attackers at bay.

To make matters worse, human-centric protections are found somewhat lacking elsewhere too. Despite insiders leading the way as the primary cause of data loss, just 70% have a dedicated resource for insider risk management, leaving almost a third of businesses exposed.

12% of retail and healthcare organizations admitted to not having an insider risk management program, making them the most exposed industries amongst those surveyed. More than a quarter (26%) of French companies do not have an insider risk management program in place, followed by Japan (15%), the UK and Canada (10%).

![Pie chart showing responses to "Does your organization have an insider risk management program in place?".
- Yes, we have a program (Net): 95%
  - Yes, we have a dedicated resource: 70%
  - Yes, we do ad hoc investigations: 25%
- No: 5%](image-9-insider-risk-management-program)

> “Year after year, human error continues to rank as the greatest cybersecurity vulnerability—and 2025 is no exception. It is encouraging to see that many CISOs believe their employees understand their role in data protection. However, awareness alone does not equate to security. Organizations must go further by equipping users with the tools, training and support needed to act securely in an increasingly complex, AI-riddled digital environment.”

## Chapter 5: AI: Friend and foe
While organizations could do more to raise employee awareness of cybersecurity threats, it is not the only factor behind human risk’s near-permanent top spot on the inventory of CISO concerns.

The way we work and share information has changed, bringing with it new and changing risks.

Therefore, the way we protect our people and data in this environment must also change. The rapid accessibility and adoption of GenAI has all but opened an invisible back door into many organizations, allowing people to share and create data outside traditional protections.

60% of global CISOs believe generative AI poses a risk to their organization, up from 54% in 2024.

![Bar chart showing the percentage of CISOs who believe generative AI is a security risk to their organization. Global average for 2025 is 60%, up from 54% in 2024.
