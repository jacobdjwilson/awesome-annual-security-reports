Allianz Risk Barometer
Identifying the major business risks for 2025

The most important corporate concerns for the year
ahead, as ranked by 3,700+ risk management experts
from more than 100 countries and territories

## Methodology

The 14th Allianz Risk Barometer incorporates the views of 3,778 respondents from 106 countries
and territories. The annual corporate risk survey was conducted among Allianz customers
(businesses around the globe), brokers and industry trade organizations. It also surveyed risk
consultants, underwriters, senior managers, claims experts, as well as other risk management
professionals in the corporate insurance segment of Allianz Commercial and other Allianz entities.

Respondents were questioned during October and November 2024. The survey focused on large,
smaller and mid-size companies. Respondents were asked to select the industry about which they
were particularly knowledgeable and to name up to three risks they believed to be most important.

Most answers were for large-size companies (>US$500mn annual revenue) [1,747 respondents,
46%]. Mid-size companies ($100mn+ to $500mn revenue) contributed 936 respondents (25%), while
smaller enterprises (<$100mn revenue) produced 1,095 respondents (29%). Risk experts from 24
industry sectors were featured.

Ranking changes in the Allianz Risk Barometer are determined by positions year-on-year,
not percentages.

**Cyber incidents** (38% of responses) is the top global risk
for 2025 and by a higher margin than ever before – 7%
points ahead of business interruption in #2. It is the fourth
year in a row that cyber is ranked #1 after first ranking top
in 2020. Ten years ago, it ranked only #8 globally with just
12% of responses.

Impact of a data breach is the exposure companies fear
most. Cyber also ranks as the top risk for large, mid-sized
and smaller companies.

2 →

**Business interruption** ranks #2 in the Allianz Risk
Barometer, meaning it has appeared in the top two risks
for the past 10 years. It is the top risk in the Asia Pacific
region (new) and in 12 countries / territories – Austria
(new), Canada, China (new), Hong Kong (new), Indonesia
(new), Malaysia, Mexico (new), Netherlands, Philippines
(new), Singapore, South Korea and Sweden (new).

In 2025, it is the top risk across the Europe, North and
South America, Africa and Middle East regions and in
20 countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil (new),
Colombia (new), France, Germany, India, Italy, Kenya,
Mauritius, Morocco (new), Nigeria, Philippines (new),
Portugal, South Africa (new), Switzerland, Uganda, UK
and USA.

It is also the top risk in (8) industries: Aviation (new),
chemicals (new), entertainment (new), financial
services, media, professional services, technology,
and telecommunications.

The impact of a cyber incident or a natural catastrophe are
the business interruption exposures companies fear most.
The most important actions that companies are taking to
de-risk their supply chains and make them more resilient,
according to respondents are: Developing alternative /
multiple suppliers; Broadening geographical diversification
of supplier networks in response to geopolitical trends; and
Initiating / improving business continuity management.

5 ↑

**Climate change** moves up into the top five risks at #5
(#7 in 2024) – its highest ever position in the Allianz
Risk Barometer. The closely interlinked peril of natural
catastrophes remains at #3 with more respondents
selecting this risk year-on-year. There has been a renewed
focus on climate change risk post-Covid-19 after it dropped
down the ranking during the pandemic years as companies
dealt with more immediate challenges.

Awareness among businesses of the need to deploy climate
resilience measures is growing, driven by the mounting costs
firms face from regulatory compliance on disclosing physical
climate risks, as well as operational disruptions caused by
more extreme weather events and ecosystem degradation.

The three major impacts of climate change that companies
fear most according to respondents are: Acute physical
impact (e.g., damage to production sites due to extreme
weather); Business interruption impact (e.g., supply
chain bottlenecks, disruption of logistics due to extreme
weather events); and Environmental impact (e.g., extreme
temperatures, resource scarcity, biodiversity loss).

Managing climate change transition risk (e.g.,
decarbonization / net zero strategy) is the environmental,
social, and governance (ESG) / sustainability risk trend
of most concern, followed by cyber security resilience
and increasing ESG / sustainability regulatory and
disclosure requirements.

The top three actions that companies are taking to
mitigate the direct impact of climate change according
to respondents are: Adapting or increasing insurance
protection (incl. alternative risk transfer); Adopting carbon-
reducing business models (e.g., recycling and reducing
waste, encouraging sustainable travel, developing more
sustainable supply chains); and Creating contingency
plans for climate-related eventualities (e.g., response and
recovery, assessing critical systems and resources).

**Natural catastrophes** for the fifth consecutive year insured losses due to natural catastrophes
surpassed the US$100bn mark in 2024, so
it is no surprise this peril ranks #3 in 2025, after ranking
only #6 in 2023. It is the top risk in 9 countries / territories
– Austria, Croatia, Greece, Hong Kong, Japan, Romania,
Slovenia, Spain, Turkey – and heads the construction and
shipping rankings.

4 →

**Changes in legislation and regulation** remains at #4
globally, albeit with a significant increase in respondents
year-on-year. Sustainability reporting requirements are
high on the agenda in Europe, while in the US there is a risk
of a ‘regulatory Wild West’ if grandiose announcements
are followed by action, particularly around crypto and
artificial intelligence (AI).

8 ↑

**Market developments** (e.g., intensified competition
/ new entrants, M&A, market stagnation, market
fluctuation) rises to #8. Companies are more concerned
about this trend for the second year in a row but a stock
market correction in 2025 seems unlikely. However,
expected tariff walls may have numerous impacts,
including on M&A.

9 ↓

**Political risks and violence** drops one place year-on-year
to #9 but has the same share of respondents as 2024 and
is up year-on-year in countries such as France and the UK,
where it is a top five risk. It is also the top risk in Ivory Coast.
It ranks as a more concerning risk for large companies
year-on-year, up to #7, while it is also a new entry into the
top 10 risks for smaller companies at #10.

The impact of civil unrest and riots is the exposure
companies fear most according to respondents, followed
by war, and impacts on companies’ supply chains.
Terrorism and sabotage risks are also heightened.

7

ALLIANZ RISK BAROMETER 2025 | ALLIANZ COMMERCIAL

10 ↑

**New technologies** (e.g., risk impact of artificial intelligence,
connected / autonomous machines) is a new entry in the
top 10 global risks for 2025. However, 50% of respondents
believe AI brings more benefits than risks, compared with
just 15% who think the opposite. More than a third (35%)
said the impact AI was
having on their
industry was neither positive nor negative.

11 ↓

Shortage of skilled workforce drops out of the top 10
global risks at #11. Energy crisis continues to drop down
the ranking to #13 after it peaked at #4 in 2023. Critical
infrastructure blackouts (#12) and insolvency risks (#16)
are rising but not by enough to make the top 10.

7 ↓

**Macroeconomic developments** ranks #7 globally, down
two positions year-on-year. It is a higher concern for African
businesses however at #3. Theft, fraud and corruption
and critical infrastructure blackouts are also bigger
concerns for these firms than elsewhere.

Risks by company size: The top risks for large companies
(>$500mn annual revenue) largely mirror those
globally: Cyber incidents; business interruption; and
natural catastrophes.

For smaller companies (<$100mn annual revenue) –
changes in legislation and regulation is up to #2 from
#5. There are also signs that some of the risks that have
preoccupied larger companies previously are starting to
be shared by smaller firms. Climate change is up three
positions to #6 while political risks and violence is a new
entry into the top 10 risks at #10.

## Top global risks overview

Cyber, business interruption and natural catastrophes are the risks of most
concern for businesses globally in the Allianz Risk Barometer 2025. In an
increasingly volatile and interconnected risk landscape, companies and their
insurance partners must take a holistic view of risk and, continually work to invest
in and build resilience, even if the short-term nature of business decisions, world
events, and the cost-of-living crisis makes this more challenging than ever.

The Allianz Risk Barometer tracks the most important
corporate concerns for the year ahead, as voted for by a
record 3,778 risk management experts from 106 countries
and territories.

With a larger proportion of responses than ever before,
cyber incidents (38% of responses, a record 7% points
ahead) consolidates its position as the most important
risk; while notably, the risk impact of new technologies
and developments in artificial intelligence (AI) is a new
entrant in the top 10 global risks at #10. Closely interlinked
to cyber, business interruption is ranked #2 (31%), just
ahead of another related risk, natural catastrophes
at #3 (29%).

Climate change is another standout result in 2025. It is
the biggest mover in the top 10 risks globally, climbing
two places to #5 (19%), achieving its highest ever position
in the 14 years of the survey. Businesses face many
challenges. As climate- and nature-related risks continue
to rise, the financial implications will become increasingly
pronounced, whether it concerns managing climate
change transition risk, mounting costs from regulatory
compliance on disclosing physical climate risks or
operational disruptions caused by more extreme weather
events and ecosystem degradation.

Reflecting regulatory developments for sustainability
and emerging technologies, changes in legislation and
regulation (25%) also drew a bigger response this year,
retaining #4 globally.

### Top risks are increasingly complex and interdependent

Amid high levels of geopolitical and economic uncertainty,
and a shifting risk environment, the top three risks of
cyber, business interruption, and natural catastrophes,
but also many of the other perils ranked in the top 10, are
particularly complex, unpredictable and interdependent.

“What stands out in this year’s Allianz Risk Barometer
is the interconnectivity of the top risks. A change in one
– or indeed a mitigating action – might have a knock-
on effect on another, and another. Climate change,
emerging technology, regulation and geopolitical risks are
increasingly intertwined, resulting in a complex network
of cause and effect,” says Michael Bruch, Global Head of
Risk Advisory Services, Allianz Commercial.

In today's volatile and interconnected risk environment,
businesses need to adopt a holistic approach to risk
management and consistently strive to enhance their
resilience, Bruch adds.

“Extreme weather events such as the devastating floods
seen in Spain last year, increasing geopolitical conflicts,
as well as cyber incidents like the CrowdStrike outage,
demonstrate the need to continue building greater
resilience. Resilience will be the key topic going forward.

“Humans often have short memories, quickly forgetting
past events and maintaining unchanged behaviors.
Despite some valuable lessons learned from the
pandemic, which led many businesses to adopt resilience
measures, I worry that current global events and the cost-
of-living crisis might cause resilience to lose its priority. In
truth, resilience is more crucial now than ever.”

### Growing concern for cyber risk

Cyber incidents such as ransomware attacks, data
breaches and IT outages is the top global risk for 2025,
marking its fourth consecutive year at the top. Ten years
ago, it ranked only #8 globally with just 12% of responses,
compared with 38% in 2025.

“For many companies, cyber risk, exacerbated by rapid
development of AI, is the big risk overriding everything
else,” says Rishi Baviskar, Global Head of Cyber Risk
Consulting, Allianz Commercial. “Concern is widening
worldwide. Cyber is the top risk across North and South
America, in Europe and Africa, and comes out on top in 20
countries in both developed and emerging economies.”

The past year has seen continuing ransomware attacks,
which are increasingly targeting sensitive data to increase
the financial leverage on companies. Ransomware
continues to be the top cause of cyber insurance loss,
during the first six months of 2024, it accounted for
58% of the value of large cyber claims (>€1mn), Allianz
Commercial analysis shows.

A data breach is the cyber exposure companies fear most
(see graphic). “The growing significance of data breach
losses among cyber insurance claims is driven by a number
of notable trends,” says Michael Daum, Global Head of
Cyber Claims, Allianz Commercial.

As well as being the top risk in countries such as Australia,
France, Germany, India, Italy, Portugal and the UK, cyber
is also the new top risk year-on-year in Brazil, Colombia,
Philippines, Morocco and South Africa. It also ranks as the
top risk for large, mid-sized and smaller companies and is
now ranked #1 by respondents in industries ranging from
aviation to chemicals to entertainment. Financial services,
media, professional services such as legal, technology, and
the telecommunications sectors also cite cyber as their risk
of most concern.

“A rise in ransomware attacks including data exfiltration
is a consequence of changing attacker tactics and the
growing interdependencies between organizations
sharing ever more volumes of personal records. At the
same time, the evolving regulatory and legal environment
has brought an uptick in so-called ‘non-attack’ data
privacy-related class action litigation, resulting from
incidents such as wrongful collection and processing of
personal data – the share of these claims has tripled in
value in two years alone.”

Cyber is likely to remain a top risk for organizations going
forward, given the growing reliance on technology, and as
AI is incorporated into a growing number of products and
services, according to Daniel Muller, Emerging Risks and
Trends Manager, Allianz Commercial: “Advancements in
technology, enhanced connectivity, faster network speeds,
and the rise of remote work and digital commerce will
continue to elevate cyber risks, such as data breaches and
ransomware attacks. AI will further amplify and accelerate
these threats, but it also holds the potential to enhance
cyber security measures, offering a dual-edged sword in
the digital landscape.”

Cyber also overlaps with several other highly ranked risks
in the Allianz Risk Barometer. According to respondents,
cyber incidents are the cause of business interruption
companies fear most. It also ranks as the second biggest
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and
sustainability risk of concern for companies, behind only
climate change transition challenges.

#### AI: New technology, new entrant

Closely related to cyber is the impact of new technologies.
This risk is a new entry into the top 10 global risks for 2025
at #10, an upwards shift driven by the rapid development
and application of AI technology, since the launch of
OpenAI’s Chat GPT in 2022. Of course, AI promises a myriad
of benefits and improved processes and efficiencies but is
also accompanied by a host of new risks, which means the
new technologies risk category is back on the radar of many
companies after five years outside the global top 10.

“Companies have little choice but to adopt AI due to its
rapid advancement. Those who hesitate risk falling behind
competitors and missing valuable opportunities. While
technology development used to be gradual, today’s
fast-paced AI landscape, coupled with regulatory and
legal lag, demands swift adoption. This is the new normal,”
says Muller.

The jury still appears out as to whether the benefits of
AI comprehensively outweigh the risks – when asked
about the impact AI is having on their industry, 50% of
respondents said they believed it brings more benefits
than risks, while 35% said it was “neither a positive
nor a negative” and 15% that there were more risks
than benefits.

With AI, a balance needs to be found between risk and
reward, according to Baviskar: “Take cyber risk. AI is
being used by criminals and nation states to cause
disruption or spread misinformation. But it can also help
mitigate risks and build resilience. AI can help improve
processes and productivity, but it also impacts employees
and raises questions in areas like ethics, privacy and
cyber security.”

While the application of AI can help prevent or mitigate
risk, there can be unintended consequences, Bruch adds.
“AI plays a crucial role in creating solutions to lower
emissions and support the transition to Net Zero, such
as by enhancing the efficiency of energy generation,
transmission, and consumption. However, it is important to
note that AI itself demands substantial computing power
and energy.

“One mitigation action can create new problems, or even
be counterproductive to the original goal. This is a major
challenge going forward. Businesses will need to manage
these risks and risk prevention measures holistically. It's
essential to ensure that an AI-driven solution doesn't
inadvertently increase risks, such as those related to
climate change.”

### Interconnectivity drives BI concerns

Business interruption (BI) has ranked either #1 or #2
in every Allianz Risk Barometer for the past decade.
Its persistence at the top reflects severe supply chain
disruption during and after the pandemic. Closely aligned
with many of the other top risks in the Allianz Risk
Barometer, BI is typically a consequence of events like a
natural disaster, a cyber attack or outage, insolvency or
political risks like conflict or civil unrest.

This year it is the new top risk in the Asia Pacific region and
is the most important risk in 12 countries and territories
including seven where it is a new top risk for 2025 (Austria,
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, and
Sweden). It is also the top risk for 11 industries, including
food, consumer goods, hospitality, heavy industry, energy,
transport and manufacturing.

Cyber incidents and natural catastrophes are the
two BI exposures companies fear most, according to
respondents followed by fire, machinery breakdown and
supplier failure.

The push for technological advancement and efficiency
is affecting the resilience of supply chains. Nowadays, a
failure or disruption in any segment of a supply chain
tends to be more severe, leaving minimal time to respond, says
Michael Bruch, Global Head of Risk Advisory Services,
Allianz Commercial.

“Automation and digitization have significantly accelerated
processes, which can sometimes overwhelm individuals
due to the rapid pace and complexity of modern
technology. While many organizations strive to implement
comprehensive strategies for disaster recovery and business
continuity, there remains a concern that contingency plans
themselves may be overly dependent on technology,
highlighting the need for diverse and adaptable solutions.”

There were several large supply chain disruption events in
2024, including the CrowdStrike IT outage in July, one of the
largest to date. A faulty update to CrowdStrike’s security
software affected computers running Microsoft Windows,
reportedly costing Fortune 500 companies over US$5.4bn,
with insured losses of $540mn to $1bn¹.

Supply chain
disruptions with
global effects occur
approximately
every 1.4 years, and
the trend is rising

“Last year’s outage affecting CrowdStrike and Microsoft
users was a reminder that IT and software supply chains
can go down, and when they do, it can have a global
impact,” says Rishi Baviskar, Global Head of Cyber Risk
Consulting, Allianz Commercial.

“Our reliance on technology companies for IT
infrastructure, software, and services is increasing, and
we can expect more disruptive events like CrowdStrike to
happen in the future. And with AI and generative AI, our
dependency on a relatively small number of technology
providers will intensify.”

Concern for BI is also being driven by supply chain
disruption and geopolitical risks. Supply chain disruptions
with global effects occur approximately every 1.4 years,
and the trend is rising, according to a white paper
from Circular Republic, in collaboration with Porsche
Consulting², Allianz and Agora Strategy. Those disruptions
cause major economic damages, ranging up to 5% to 10%
of product costs and additional downtime impacts.

Major disruption to shipping and transport is also seen as
a higher risk for BI in 2025 than in previous Allianz Risk
Barometers, reflecting disruption brought by Yemen’s
Houthis in the Red Sea, and restrictions on transits in the
Panama Canal due to drought conditions.

With 90% of global trade conducted by sea, disruption
can have substantial economic consequences. The six-day
blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given container
ship in 2021 is estimated to have cost as much as $60bn³.

## Climate change reaches new high

Climate change moves up two positions into the top five
global risks at #5, its highest ever position, while the closely
interlinked peril of natural catastrophes remains at #3.
There has been a renewed focus on this risk, and natural
catastrophe risk management, after they dropped down
the ranking during the pandemic years as companies had
to deal with more immediate challenges.

In addition to climate change, natural catastrophe losses
are also affected by other factors, such as claims inflation,
higher value assets, population changes and resilience:
“While climate change may only be partly responsible
for what we are seeing, with an increase in the frequency
and severity of extreme events, it is making things more
unpredictable,” says Villar Vega.

2024 was another year of extreme weather and new
climate records. Last year is expected to be the hottest
year on record as warming hit 1.5°C, according to
the WMO⁴. With an active hurricane season, severe
thunderstorms and floods
