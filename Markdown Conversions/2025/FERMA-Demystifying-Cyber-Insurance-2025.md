## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background
In today’s increasingly digital world, cyber resilience is essential for organisations of all sizes and in all sectors. Indeed, Risk Managers worldwide have identified cyberattacks as the most critical risk threatening their activities since 2020 (see: FERMA Global Risk Managers Survey 2024[^1]). As technological acceleration increases the effectiveness of malicious cyber incidents and companies’ overall cyber risk exposure, being unprepared in the digital realm should be considered an existential risk.

Cyber resilience is achieved through the calibrated synthesis of risk management, business continuity and cybersecurity - which is essential to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber risks. It must be kept in mind that there is no such thing as a ‘risk-free’ organisation: when an incident does occur, insurance is a critical tool to help companies recover and mitigate any long-lasting impact on their operations. This report focuses on the role of cyber insurance as part of a comprehensive resilience strategy – while reaffirming that risk management and risk transfer must always be seen as complementary.

FERMA, Marsh, Howden and other industry stakeholders in 2023 jointly published a report entitled _Cyber Insurance Dialogue: How Europe can lead the way to cyber resilience_ with the aim of addressing the challenges faced by all participants in the cyber insurance chain. This paper is the continuation of FERMA’s longstanding commitment to constructively engage with all stakeholders to build a well-functioning and affordable cyber insurance market contributing to the overall resilience of the EU economy.

### 1.2. Why this new report?
A pervasive scepticism plagues the risk management community on the topic of cyber insurance. Interviews conducted by FERMA reveal that European Risk Managers harbour concerns regarding:

- **Exclusions**, notably for war and systemic risks, but also the exclusion of cyber risks from traditional policies (e.g. property, BI) as (re)insurers are perceived to be moving towards broader exclusions.
- **Coverage gaps** emerging from the interaction of disparate traditional insurance policies and cyber-specific insurance policies.
- **Claims management**, especially a lack of clarity around triggers and disputes around claims payments.

This perception is undoubtedly a contributory factor to the low cyber insurance penetration rate in Europe: according to Marsh, only 15% of SMEs purchase cyber insurance, despite the fact that they represent 99% of all European companies. This low cyber insurance take-up rate is a key driver of the cyber insurance gap, which the Global Federation of Insurance Associations (GFIA) estimated in 2023 to be more than $900 billion per annum globally, with Europe accounting for 23% of that total (i.e. $207 billion per annum[^2]).

At the same time, Risk Managers are increasingly concerned about insurance gaps: 53% fear that some of their activities might become uninsurable, with cyberattacks, digitalisation risks and technological threats all considered to be in the top five areas where coverage is believed most likely to be withdrawn[^3].

However, we believe that this scepticism does not fully reflect the current state of the cyber insurance market. Although challenges undeniably remain, a lack of awareness and understanding about cyber insurance products contribute to underestimating the value that cyber insurance can bring to organisations, limiting the level of resilience that European businesses could achieve.

It is also important to acknowledge that concerns differ depending on the type of organisation. Large corporates often point to market volatility, high deductibles, complex claims processes and insufficient compensation for exclusions in traditional policies. SMEs, on the other hand, frequently face challenges such as lack of product transparency, limited guidance, high entry barriers due to technical requirements and uncertainty about the actual value of coverage relative to cost. These different perspectives must be taken into account when discussing the role of cyber insurance in a resilience strategy.

In some cases, alternative risk financing models or internal preparedness measures may prove more efficient. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise that, when used appropriately, cyber insurance can make a valuable contribution to resilience. It not only provides financial protection, but also access to specialised services such as incident response, forensic analysis and crisis communication. For SMEs, this can be a decisive added value to enable them to remain operational in the event of a cyber incident.

### 1.3. Aim of this report
This report is directed towards the key stakeholders in the cyber insurance market: (re)insurers, brokers, Risk Managers and corporate insurance buyers more broadly. Its aim is twofold:

1. To provide an overview of current state of the cyber insurance market, as well as the trends that are shaping it, in order to develop clearer understanding of what kind of risks it can cover and how.
2. To address existing challenges, by clarifying misunderstanding and providing recommendations to ensure that all stakeholders can benefit from a well-functioning and affordable cyber insurance market.

In addition, the report includes practical case studies to illustrate typical challenges and solutions.

## 2. State of Play of the European Cyber Insurance Market

### 2.1. Key trends and figures

#### 2.1.1. Historical trends

**Late 1990s-2020: Market Expansion.**
Since its inception, cyber insurance has been both attractive to and feared by insurers. However, since its infancy until 2020 the number of insurers and clients grew rapidly. Despite there being no claims history and limited knowledge of the risk involved, insurers around the world rushed to market this product.

![Figure 2 - Compared to others growing lines like Directors & Officers (D&O), cyber insurance grew rapidly from 2015 to projections for 2025. Source: Howden]

**2020-2023: Turning Point**
Cyber Insurance rates skyrocketed due to an increase in the incidence of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) attacks. This led to a contraction in the market, with notable increases in retention and price together with restrictions in cover, capacity and appetite. During this period, market players learned relevant cyber controls to mitigate ransomware claims and impact.

![Figure 3 - The rise of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) caused a sharp increase in claims ratios, which led to market contraction and also in premiums. Source: Howden]

**2024- Today: Back to a buyer-friendly market**
Companies around the world increased their cybersecurity spending, leading to a lower frequency and severity of claims and a return to profitability for insurers. The market is now soft again and clients are experiencing a “return on investment” in their cybersecurity spend in the form of, lower premiums and retentions, and broader terms and conditions.

![Figure 4 – Once clients increased cybersecurity investments, resulting in fewer and less severe claims, insurers experienced improved profitability, and the market cycle shifted back to favourable conditions for clients. Source: Howden]

In 2024, Europe represented about $3.9 billion in cyber insurance premiums (23,62% of the global cyber insurance market), of which $2.2 billion were collected in continental Europe and the remaining $1.7 billion in the United Kingdom (retail and wholesale).

Across European industries, buyers of cyber insurance products operate in financial services (15% of the market), manufacturing (14%) and services (12%). By contrast, the healthcare sector represents a negligible share of the European market (2%), especially when compared with the United States and Canada (11%).

Europe is one of the fastest growing cyber insurance markets, estimated to account for 25% of the cyber premium growth between 2024 and 2030, with the United Kingdom estimated to account for an additional 9%[^4].

#### 2.1.2. Current market dynamics

**Capacity, Retention & Rates**
Currently, it appears that existing insurers are offering larger lines per risk. New entrants are causing increased competition for primary business and even more in excess lines - including for SMEs. As a consequence, retention levels have dropped significantly. Many clients have purchased higher limits and have adjusted their programmes and retentions. Rates show double-digit decreases in primary layers and even more aggressive pricing in excess layers. The current soft market reflects improved cyber risk management and stronger security measures, an increase in cyber risk management and security measures among buyers of coverage.

Following the previous hard market, recent advancements in aggregation modeling gave buyers greater confidence in deploying capital through insurance. After several years focused on portfolio remediation, carriers returned to a growth phase. This renewed optimism, combined with the entry of new capacity into the European market, has intensified competition and led to an overall reduction in premiums. Overall, cyber insurance rates decreased for the first half of 2025 with an average reduction of 10% to 15% and in some cases more than 30%. Meanwhile, 63% of clients experienced a discount in their premiums, considerably higher when compared with H1 2024[^5].

In Q3 2025, cyber rate reductions accelerated, averaging around 15%, with variations depending on industry, risk quality and client revenue bands. Larger enterprises with enhanced security controls have experienced even greater rate decreases. European companies are capitalising on this softening market by purchasing higher coverage limits and adjusting their retention levels. Coverage restrictions are being lifted as underlying risk quality improves and insurers become more flexible, allowing for broader coverage options. Additionally, the underwriting process has become less complex, with underwriters gaining greater confidence from the more detailed information provided in application forms.

In June 2024, global cyber insurance premium prices were down 15% from their peak in mid-2022. In addition to price decreases (which vary significantly by sector, region and risk profile, with competition highest in remote risk layers), capacity is up and insurers are also willing to increase limits, remove cover restrictions (ransomware-related) and lower retention levels[^6].

At the same time, insurance companies are requiring businesses to strengthen their cybersecurity, which can lead to market improvements. The CyberArk Identity Security Landscape Report 2025[^7] reveals how widespread this trend has become. The report shows that 88% of organisations worldwide say their insurers now require advanced security controls. In Italy, this trend is even more pronounced, with the study finding that 95% of Italian organisations are responding to their insurance companies’ requirements for greater security measures. CyberArk’s research highlights a major shift in how cybersecurity decisions are made. Insurance companies know how expensive data breaches and cyberattacks can be, so they are no longer just giving advice. The report shows that insurers are now setting strict requirements that companies must follow to obtain or keep their insurance coverage. The report suggests that this outside pressure is driving positive change. Namely: companies now have to think about multiple things at once: keeping their data safe and protecting their reputation, while also making sure they can stay in business and remain financially stable through appropriate insurance coverage. The research frames this insurance pressure as a real opportunity for companies to speed up their cybersecurity improvements.

**Underwriting Info**
- Insurers now ask fewer questions thanks to mature data and technology.
- There is more flexibility regarding key cybersecurity controls.

**Coverage**
- Insurers typically eliminated restrictions and broadened coverage for accounts with additional industry-specific extensions and solutions.
- Co-insurance for ransomware and systemic risks has ended.
- Long-term agreements (LTAs) and extended coverage options are returning.
- Back to broad wordings, including reinstatement, non-IT Contingent Business Interruption.
- War Exclusions stabilised around variant B clause from Munich Re.

**Key figures on market penetration (rough estimates)**
- Large organisations account for about 50% of European cyber insurance premiums, followed by small organisations (~20%), medium-sized organisations (~18%) and micro-organisations (~12%)[^8].
- This means that large corporates remain disproportionately overrepresented among cyber insurance buyers, since they represent just 0.2% of all EU companies.
- Overall, Marsh estimates that the insurance penetration rate hovers around 15% for SMEs.

#### 2.1.3. Evolution of Cyber Insurance Claims
The number of cyberattacks, especially ransomware, continues to rise, but these attacks are, on the whole, better mitigated by clients. According to Marsh, cyber claims notifications in Europe rose by 61% in 2024 compared with the previous year, with approximately 10% of cyber policyholders reporting an event. This increase is mainly driven by malicious events (72%), although the share of non-malicious events rose to 28% of all notifications (compared with 14% in 2023). Incident origins were both internal and external — including some involving third or fourth parties in the supply chain.

In 2024, professional services clients made the highest number of claims notifications to Marsh, followed closely by the communications, media, and technology (CMT) sector, manufacturing, and financial institutions (FIs). When comparing this distribution year-over-year, both professional services and manufacturing sectors experienced a significant surge in notifications, with numbers approximately doubling compared with 2023. Notably, the chemical industry also experienced a substantial increase in notifications in 2024. In contrast, financial institutions experienced a significant decrease in volume of claims, with claims notifications dropping by approximately one-third. This decline contrasts with the rising claims notifications observed in other sectors and reflects the strengthening of the industry’s cyber resilience since the introduction of the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)[^9].

![Figure 7 - The professional service sector generated the most notifications in 2024. Source: Marsh]

Regarding the type of incidents leading to notifications, network interruptions exceeded all other categories but were primarily driven by the CrowdStrike incident (see page 10). Cyber extortion and data breaches remain the core concerns for European organisations. As in previous years, the number of confirmed data breaches remained high. The unique regulatory landscape in Europe, characterised by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR[^10]) and varying interpretations of its provisions across jurisdictions, underscores the necessity for Risk Managers to prioritise GDPR compliance both before and during an incident.

![Figure 8 - Network interruptions most prevalent incident type in 2024. Source: Marsh]

In recent months, as over the past few years, there has been a notable decline in ransom payments by organisations, which can be attributed to several factors.

Firstly, organisations have increasingly developed robust security and backup systems to safeguard against the deletion or encryption of data, which has reduced the effectiveness of ransomware attacks.

Secondly, threat actors have shifted their tactics, resorting to data exfiltration rather than traditional ransomware encryption, meaning that organisations have less of an incentive to pay ransoms where their operations are not directly threatened.

Thirdly, the legal risk of making ransom payments is increasing, as many governments (including that of the United Kingdom) are discussing partial ransom payment bans. France, for example, imposes an obligation on companies that are victims of malicious computer attacks to file a complaint to preserve their right to compensation under their insurance policy, including cyber extortion; making ransom payments to threat actors thus creates a legal risk to the payee organisation’s directors and officers, since threat actors may be sanctioned entities/persons, which would make a ransom payment an unlawful act.

Lastly, cyber extortion consultancy companies have reported a decrease in the reliability of threat actor groups in fulfilling their promise after receiving a ransom payment, both regarding the provision of a functioning file decryption key and in not leaking or otherwise selling previously exfiltrated data.

> **Focus: the impact of the CrowdStrike incident on cyber claims**
>
> The CrowdStrike incident of 19 July 2024 had an oversized impact on cyber claims notifications in 2024, as it affected millions of users worldwide, as a faulty update to its Falcon Sensor security software caused widespread problems with Microsoft Windows computers running the software.
>
> Yet, even when discounting claims notifications related to this incident, there was still a 43% increase in overall claims volume and frequency compared to the previous year. The overall increase becomes 61% when including notifications related to CrowdStrike.
>
> It must nevertheless be noted that, despite being far reaching and widely covered in the media, the CrowdStrike incident was ultimately less costly than expected: $ 0.5 billion, versus initial estimates of $ 1 billion).

> **Focus: Claims and the Risk Manager**
>
> - Claims data are useful to draw historical trends and for benchmarking but should only be seen as indicators, since they are by nature aggregated and backwards looking. Corporate insurance buyers should focus primarily on their own risk profile and careful risk evaluation to guide their insurance procurement.
> - We recommend that Risk Managers follow the claims protocol outlined in Appendix 2 of the Cyber Insurance Dialogue to improve the quality of the cyber risk and the resilience of their organisation:
>
> 1. **Prepare before the incident**: conduct a risk assessment, develop a cyber incident response plan, train employees, conduct regular stress tests of cybersecurity measures.
> 2. **Contain the incident**: quickly isolate and contain the affected systems of devices to prevent further damage or spread of the cyberattack.
> 3. **Notify relevant parties**: inform all relevant stakeholders and activate cyber insurance.
> 4. **Activate the Incident Response Plan.**
> 5. **Mitigate the Damage**: Implement mitigation measures to limit the damage.
> 6. **Report the Incident**: Inform law enforcement or regulatory bodies, if required.
> 7. **Restore Normal Operations**: Work to restore normal operations as soon as possible and implement measures to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

### 2.2 Legislative frameworks

In our assessment, the wording of cyber insurance policies is standard across European countries despite differences in legislative frameworks. However, Risk Managers still need to pay attention to several legal considerations, which may impact their cyber insurance programme.

#### 2.2.1. Cyber incident reporting obligations
Across the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland, reporting obligations following cyber incidents vary depending on the jurisdiction and type of cyber event.

Several EU laws mandate the reporting of cyber incidents to various authorities on different timelines[^11]:

- Under the **NIS2 Directive**[^12], relevant organisations must report ‘significant incidents’ within 24 hours to their national cyber security incident response team followed by an initial assessment of severity, impact, and indicators of compromise within 72 hours.
- **GDPR** requires that cyber incidents resulting in data breaches be reported within 72 hours of the organisation becoming aware of the breach.
- For cyber incidents that trigger regulatory obligations under **DORA**, there are a number of stages that organisations must address before triggering the need to report a ‘major ICT-related incident’. Once this is triggered, an initial report must be made no later than “than 24 hours from the moment the financial entity has become aware of the ICT-related incident,” an intermediate report is required within 72 hours of the initial notification, with a final report required no later than one month after.

As an EU member state, **France** is subject to the above EU rules; however, Article 5 of the LOPMI[^13] (Orientation and Programming Law of the Ministry of the Interior) explicitly adds cyber risks into the French insurance code. It makes it compulsory for any victim of an attack on an automated data processing system to report to the competent authorities (police, gendarmerie, or the public prosecutor) no later than 72 hours after the victim becomes aware of the attack in order to be compensated by any insurance policy.

In the **United Kingdom**, reporting requirements are dependent on the type of incident. The UK NIS Directive includes mandatory reporting requirements of 72 hours for incidents having a significant impact on the continuity of ‘operators of essential services’. Similarly, and analogous to the European Union, cyber incidents resulting in data breaches should be notified to the UK data protection regulator (the ICO) within 72 hours of an organisation becoming aware of the breach. Voluntary reporting of incidents to the UK National Cyber Security Centre is also encouraged. Additionally, the proposed Cyber Security and Resilience Bill is expected to align with the reporting timescales within the NIS2 Directive, requiring an initial report within 24 hours, and a full report in 72 hours. Finally, the proposed ransomware reporting regime for the United Kingdom would require mandatory reporting of a ransomware incident within 72 hours, and a follow-up report within 28 days.

In **Switzerland**, operators of critical infrastructure are required to report cyberattacks to the Swiss National Cyber Security Centre within 24 hours of discovery, and to complete an initial report within a further 14 days. Reporting is required where the functioning of critical infrastructure is threatened, or there is manipulation or leak of information, or blackmail, threats or coercion. Critical infrastructure operators that fail to report a cyberattack may be fined. Finally, data breaches in Switzerland must be reported to the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner ‘as soon as possible’ after becoming aware of the breach.

In **Italy**, the regulatory stratification highlighted above can trigger different notification obligations to different Authorities. For example, in the case of a ransomware attack:
- the GDPR will apply if personal data is compromised.
- NIS2 will apply where delivery of a critical service is disrupted.
- DORA will apply if the attack has a significant operational impact on a bank.

In such cases, the affected organisation must notify:
- the Privacy Guarantor within 72 hours (GDPR).
- the ACN (National Cybersecurity Agency) within 24/72 hours (NIS2).
- the Bank of Italy within 4/24 hours (DORA).

Furthermore, at the time of this report, Bill no. 1441 of April 3, 2025, is under discussion to establish a comprehensive anti-ransomware strategy that prohibits ransom payments by organisations in the National Cyber Security Perimeter, with administrative penalties for violations and Prime Ministerial exceptions for national security threats. The legislation requires six-hour attack reporting to CSIRT, which coordinates responses with government agencies and intelligence services. The framework foresees institutional support through ACN (the National Cybersecurity Agency) operational plans and a dedicated CSIRT task force offering technical assistance and victim coordination. The bill also considers the creation of a public compensation fund that will partially cover economic losses for compliant organisations. The bill also criminalises Ransomware-as-a-Service platforms and provides legal protection for good-faith vulnerability disclosures, creating a prevention-focused approach that combines prohibition, support, compensation and enhanced enforcement to combat cyber extortion. In addition, the bill provides for the promotion of the underwriting of cyber-insurance, through the provision of additional tax and contribution benefits.

It is worth remembering that cyber insurance is not a substitute for robust cybersecurity measures but a complementary tool to help manage and transfer some of the financial risks associated with cyber incidents. Cyber insurance can accompany businesses in incident management and compliance in several ways:

- By providing financial protection by covering costs associated with cyber incidents (data breaches, ransomware attacks, business interruption).
- By offering support for incident response; cyber insurance often includes access to a network of experts who can assist in responding to cyber incidents (forensic investigators, legal counsel or IT specialists for instance). This is key as some regulations (such as NIS2) focus on specific response processes.
- By giving access to risk assessment and mitigation aimed at helping businesses identify vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security measures.
- By providing coverage for business interruption losses resulting from cyber incidents, therefore allowing for business continuity (through reimbursement for lost income, costs associated with restoring system and data, etc).
- By helping businesses to meet regulatory obligations by providing guidance on compliance and covering the costs associated with regulatory fines and penalties resulting from non-compliance.

#### 2.2.2. Insurability of fines and penalties
In most instances, insurance policies (including cyber policies) provide indemnity for “fines and penalties covered to the extent insurable by law” or similar wording. The insurability of fines and penalties is not standardised across Europe, and is not necessarily ordinarily regulated or legislated upon.

In **Germany** for instance, there is no concrete view. The German Civil Code states that any legal transaction that is contrary to public policy is void; this may be interpreted as meaning that illegal conduct justifying a fine or penalty cannot be indemnified against, this being inconsistent with public policy.

In the **Netherlands**, similarly, there is no conclusive position. In line with the Dutch Civil Code, if coverage for fines and penalties is considered incompatible with public policy then the insurance contract may be considered null and void. Determining whether insuring certain fines and penalties aligns with public policy may involve an assessment of whether the policy wording reduces the intention of the fine or penalty, namely to prevent or challenge negligent or wilful conduct.

In the **United Kingdom**, there are similar public policy questions expressed via the _ex turpi causa_ principle – often referred to as the ‘illegality defence’. In these circumstances, the principle arguably prohibits the recovery (via insurance) of penalties or fines resulting from deliberate or intentional wrongdoing, as opposed to from conduct that is negligent. The Financial Conduct Authority, for example, explicitly states that regulated firms cannot insure against FCA-imposed financial penalties.

In **Switzerland**, judicial precedents and the opinions of legal professionals uphold the view that fines and penalties are not insurable. Any policy providing coverage for fines and penalties may be considered unenforceable, but once again, public policy factors are important to these considerations.

In **Italy**, fines and penalties related to cyber risk are partially insurable through cyber risk policies, but with exclusions and specific limitations provided for by the contractual conditions, such as malicious acts or intentional conduct of the insured. The coverage may include legal fees for civil, criminal and administrative disputes, but not the criminal penalties themselves, while financial penalties can be compensated within certain limits.

It is clear that, across these jurisdictions, the insurability of specific fines and penalties is contingent on the nature of the conduct that gave rise to them.

#### 2.2.3. Insurability of ransoms
Ordinarily, when considering the insurance implications of a ransom payment, the question is not one of insurability but legality. Under a strict legal interpretation, cyber insurance policies are policies of indemnity. A policyholder seeks an indemnity for the sums which it has paid out, which may include a ransom.

It is not the ransom itself which is insured but the policyholder’s liability. Insurers will therefore be concerned to ensure that the policyholder has complied with its legal and regulatory obligations before authorising or making a ransom payment. For example, an insurer will need to establish that any payment has not been made in breach of any domestic or EU sanctions legislation or consider whether links exist to terrorism or certain entities or individuals.

There is no reason in principle why a lawfully made ransom payment should not be insurable. Commercial considerations, such as the risk of encouraging further attacks, do not affect the insurability of ransoms.

Insurers need to be aware of legislative or regulatory developments affecting this issue. In the United Kingdom, for instance, proposals have been advanced to legislate certain issues in respect of ransomware.

- One proposal would formally prohibit all public sector bodies, including local governments, and all owners of critical national infrastructure, from making ransom payments. The efficacy of any proposed ban may lie in the proposed enforcement measures, including possible civil penalties.
- A second proposal would require all proposed ransomware payments (outside of those expressly prohibited) to be reported. The Government would then review proposed payments, blocking those which may breach sanctions designations or which are in violation of terrorism finance legislation. The victim would retain discretion to make a payment where it is not expressly blocked. Again, the efficacy of this proposal will likely lie in any enforcement measures, again including possible civil penalties.

In those instances where ransom payments are made despite being expressly prohibited by legislation or subject to a government block, it is likely that those payments would not be insurable. Similarly, any civil penalties would be subject to those considerations above regarding the insurability of fines and penalties.
