# Key Takeaways

Compared to 2023, 2024 saw a smaller increase in cyber
attacks that caused physical consequences on OT organizations.
Nevertheless, there were sharp jumps in the number of sites affected
by the hacks, as well as in the number of attacks by nation states. attributed
to nation state threat actors. Key findings in this report include:

• 2024 saw a 146% increase in sites suffering physical impairment of

operations because of cyber attacks, rising from 412 sites in 2023 to
1,015 in 2024. Most attacks impacted multiple physical locations.

• Nation-state attacks with physical consequences tripled in 2024

compared to the previous year.

• There were 76 attacks which caused physical consequences on OT

organizations. This is a 5% increase over the previous year.

• Making up 37% of all attacks, the transportation industry was the

single biggest vertical impacted by OT cyber attacks with physical
consequences in 2024.

• The discrete manufacturing and transportation industries continue to dominate

OT attacks with physical consequences.

• New ICS/OT-designed malware are increasingly being discovered in the wild.

In short, the OT threat environment and its consequences continues to worsen.

146% increase in sites impacted by cyber
attacks with physical consequences.

# Introduction & Methodology

This report’s data is a conservative estimate,
underreporting actual attack activity. Many
incidents were excluded due to disclosure
restrictions, insufficient confidence in authenticity,
or lack of access to reports in certain languages or
regions. Additionally, numerous attacks likely went
unreported or were unreliable, particularly in
censored or conflict zones. As a result, the actual
severity of today’s threat environment is certain to
be higher than the figures presented.

In 2024, there were 76 attacks
that met the strict inclusion
criteria for this report.

This report documents cyber attacks with physical
consequences. Security teams seeking funding for
cybersecurity initiatives and business decision
makers responsible for allocating such funding
each need accurate data as to what attacks have
occurred in the past and what we should
reasonably expect of the attack environment in the
future. Planning for the future is especially
challenging and important for high-consequence
operations where every change can pose a threat
to safe and correct operations, which means
changes and upgrades to our security programs
can be made only at long intervals.

In support of understanding today’s threats and
projecting tomorrow’s, this report documents
cyber attacks on physical operations and
infrastructure that:

• produce physical consequences
• are deliberate in nature – not errors and
omissions, not equipment nor software failures;
including
production delays and outages, equipment
damage, environmental disasters, injuries or
casualties – not just data theft or computer
system clean-up costs;
impacted manufacturing, building automation,
critical and heavy industrial infrastructures,
transportation of people and goods;
•

• are found in public – not private – disclosures;
• and which the research team agrees meet the
above criteria with a high degree of confidence.

Any reader wishing to verify the data can consult
Appendix A, which contains the full data set of all
incidents since 2010 and their public descriptions.

This report also touches on important
developments in the threat environment in 2024
in addition to the incident data above, including:
• near misses – important incidents that did not
cause physical consequences but are
noteworthy for other reasons;
• so-called “living off the land” attacks that are
very difficult to detect;
• and three new ICS-capable types of malware
discovered in 2024.

We conclude with defensive highlights of 2024 and
recent developments in ICS defenses including:
• New advice from multiple agencies that
encourages more secure remote access
solutions including hardware-enforced remote
access protections for OT systems.
• New advice that describes principles of
OT security, especially the safety
imperative.
• The beginning of a shift of terminology to
“credible threats” rather than “attack likelihood”
in OT security standards and guidance.

As the threat environment worsens, more kinds of
attacks which were previously ignored are
becoming credible threats that must be addressed
in security programs.

This report is a cooperative effort between
Waterfall Security Solutions and the ICS Strive OT
incident repository. We hope you find the material
useful.

The incident database
and numbers in this report
regarding attack and outage
activity are certain to be an
underestimation.

# OT Incident Macro Trends

In 2024, there were 76 attacks that met the strict inclusion criteria for this report. Most attacks affected
multiple physical sites. This is a 5% increase over the 72 attacks in the data set for 2023.

The complete count of attacks in the data set since 2010 is
illustrated in Figure (1). Most of these attacks were ransomware.
Most of the attacks impaired physical operations at multiple
sites. For comparison, the line in the chart also indicates the
number of OT ransomware incidents reported to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation¹ for the years where this data exists²,
not all of which resulted in physical consequences.

In 2024, 87% of identifiable
attacks were ransomware.

Half of attacks are even faster than that.

# SEC Filings

What is the reason for the slowing rate of increase
in OT security incidents? One likely factor is that in
late 2023 the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started enforcing regulations
that require publicly traded businesses to disclose
“material” cybersecurity incidents; incidents that
reasonable investors might use as cause to buy,
sell or value shares in the victim company. Similar
rules are already in place or are coming soon in
many jurisdictions. These new rules for incident
disclosures may well affect the number of incidents
in the public record.

New SEC & other incident
disclosure rules may be reducing,
rather than increasing, public
reports of cyber attacks with
physical consequences.

Given these new public disclosure rules in many
jurisdictions, one might assume public reports of
cyber attacks causing physical consequences
would increase sharply during 2024 over 2023. But
this was not the case. Why?

In December 2023, the SEC reduced somewhat the
level of detail needed in these reports out of
concern that too much public disclosure might
either impede incident response or provide other
attackers too much of a road map as to how to
attack similar sites. On the other hand, the SEC is
prosecuting businesses who fail to disclose cyber
incidents adequately. In 2024, the SEC accepted a $2.1 million civil penalty settlement offer from R. R. Donnelley & Sons
in part for disclosure violations from 2021-2022,
predating the new, even stronger disclosure rules.

New disclosure rules may be prompting legal
teams to get involved in cyber incident
investigations earlier and requiring a minimal level
of public disclosure. Following the prosecution of
SolarWinds executives for improper disclosure of
details of cybersecurity programs, legal teams
may have decided to limit public reporting to only
what is legally required to reduce the risk of similar
legal consequences. If this is occurring, it would
tend to reduce the number of non-material incident
disclosures and reduce the level of detail published
for potentially material incidents.

# Nation States & Hacktivists

Nation state and hacktivist attacks both seek to
bring about physical consequences with cyber
attacks. This is in contrast with ransomware
criminal groups who are financially motivated and
seek to extort cryptocurrency.
In ransomware attacks, physical consequences are
most often accidental side effects of extortion
attempts. While the numbers involved are still small,
Figure (2) shows what appears to be a marked change in the frequency of hacktivist and

nation state attacks since 2022 – attacks
deliberately targeting physical operations and
often critical infrastructures.

Most attacks relate to three ongoing geopolitical conflicts:

1

The Russo –
Ukrainian war

2

The Israel – Hamas
(Iranian proxy) war

3

The Western
Democracy-Chinese
Grey Zone Conflict

“The greatest long-term threat facing our country, in my view, is represented
by the People’s Republic of China … which I consider to be the defining threat of
our generation.” … “[The] Chinese government [is] pre-positioning on American
civilian critical infrastructure. To lie in wait on those networks, to be in a position
to wreak havoc, can inflict real-world harm at a time and place of their choosing.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray

Source: CBS News

In 2024, we saw significant incidents and near
misses in all three conflicts which are detailed in
this report. In addition, sophisticated Russian and
Chinese nation-state attacks are targeting a wide
array of Western infrastructures, thus far without
serious physical consequences.
The most
important development in 2024 regarding nation
state attacks is the near-universal conclusion by
Western intelligence agencies and governments
that the ongoing threats from China are the most
significant and of greatest concern. See the
section “Volt Typhoon’ and Salt Typhoon” for additional details.

146% in the number of sites impacted by
attacks with physical consequences.
The number of sites affected per

site counts, see Appendix A.

# Impacted Industries

Much like in 2023, 2024’s cyber attacks with
physical consequences, illustrated in Figure 4,
continue to disproportionately impact
the transportation and discrete manufacturing
industries. In 2024, these industries make up 69% of
all incidents. While transportation is the single
biggest impacted vertical at 37% in 2024,
transportation and discrete manufacturing have
alternated in “first place” for the last three years.

69% of attacks with physical
consequences hit the
transportation and discrete
manufacturing industries.

Attacks on North America’s water and wastewater
sector increased in significance and number in
2024. This report documents seven (7) new
consequential attacks and near misses on water
utilities. While the number of attacks causing OT
impacts remained the same as last year (2 incidents),
the overall threat level increased with
all but one of the seven attacks attributed as
nation-state sponsored. Five of the seven attacks
in 2024 were attributed to Russia’s Sandworm
group, a group notorious for attacks on Ukraine’s
power grid. These attacks were part of a “grey zone”
campaign where Sandworm masqueraded
as hacktivists who called themselves the Cyber
Army Reborn (CARR). See the ‘Near Misses’ section below for more
information about attacks on water utilities.

Other industry trends:

• Both the power and metals & mining industries disclosed a small number of
incidents this year (5 combined), with similar numbers last recorded in 2022
(6 combined).
• Incident counts remain steady in the process manufacturing, food &
beverage, and pharmaceuticals verticals.
• 2024 saw two more incidents in automated “smart” buildings, both on the
hospitality industry.
• The oil and gas sectors saw no new disclosed incidents in 2024.

# Impacted Regions

Regionally, the USA and Germany suffered the
largest number of incidents with physical
consequences in 2024, in first and second place
respectively, followed by Japan, the UK and
Canada.

The USA and Germany
suffered the largest number
of incidents with physical
consequences in 2024.

While the reasons for these regional numbers and
trends are unclear, it may be that criminal
ransomware is exploring new territories with strong
economies and a willingness to pay ransoms, or it
may also be that politically supported ransomware
criminals and nation state threats are strategically
targeting victims in the US, Europe, and
Asia-Pacific.

# How was OT Impacted?

For attacks where the attack pattern could be determined
from public records, 13% of attacks with physical consequences
directly impacted OT automation systems. Nearly 90% of attacks caused
physical consequences indirectly. This
is very similar to data from 2023.

Almost 90% of indirect attacks on
OT had physical consequences.

Figure 7: How cyber attacks caused physical consequences (2023 & 2024)

To generally clarify how these types of attacks are
defined:
• Direct attacks are those where malware was
found on OT systems or impacted OT systems
directly, or where remote-controlled attacks
reached into OT systems to sabotage them or
shut them down.

14

2025 OT Cyber Threat Report

---

• Indirect attacks are those where there was no
direct impact on OT systems, but physical
operations still suffered physical consequences
because operations depended on access to or
services from impaired IT systems.
• Unknown attacks are incidents where there was
not enough detail in the public record to
determine how the attack impaired operations.

Analyzing the entire 2010-2024 data set in more
detail, we determine there are eight ways in which
physical operations have been impacted – five direct and three indirect, namely:

Direct attack types:

1

2

3

5

Attacks on OT are local or remote attacks
where attack software or manual attack
actions directly affect OT automation
systems or networks.

Poor segmentation are attacks where there
is no evidence the OT network is distinct
from an IT network – i.e. the network is “flat”
– so any attack on IT is also an attack on OT.

IT pivoting attacks first compromise
IT
assets and then use the compromised
assets to attack other IT or OT assets.

Supply chain attacks are where a threat
actor surreptitiously inserts malware or
vulnerabilities into software or firmware for
assets deployed on OT networks.

Malicious insiders are where an insider uses
their credentials and/or position of privilege
to attack OT systems.

Indirect attack types:

6

7

8

Abundance of caution shutdowns occur
when an attack compromises IT systems
and the business pre-emptively shuts down
OT systems for safety reasons, to reduce
risk, to preserve forensic evidence, on the
advice of third parties, or for other reasons.

IT dependencies are where OT systems or
physical operations depend on services
provided by IT networks and servers, and
those IT assets are impaired or crippled by a
cyber attack.

3rd party outages where an enterprise
suffers no cyber attack, but one of their
suppliers does, and the loss of production, or
loss of trust
in the supplier, or other
consequence of the compromised supplier
cause the affected enterprise to reduce,
delay or halt production.

Of all the attacks in our data set (2010-2024) where
the attack type could be determined reliably from
the public record, OT shutdowns due
to “abundance of caution” and OT dependencies on IT
networks were the most common ways that
attacks on IT networks impacted operations. When
attacks deliberately targeted OT – Direct OT
attacks – nearly all those attacks were attributed
to either hacktivists or nation state threat actors.

Nearly all Direct OT attacks are attributed to
either hacktivists or nation-state threat actors.

# Implications For Cybersecurity Programs

What does this mean for cybersecurity programs?
A naïve interpretation might suggest that, since
most attacks with physical consequences target IT
networks, incremental spend on cybersecurity
programs should focus primarily on strengthening
IT networks. However, the authors of this report
argue that this interpretation is flawed for several
reasons.

IT networks are constantly
exposed to the Internet,
making them intrinsically
vulnerable. Safety-critical
networks require a level of
security that goes beyond
what is possible for IT networks.

1. Safety-critical OT networks must be designed
and secured to be extremely robust in the face
of all possible inputs and threats. IT networks
are exposed to constant interaction with the
Internet and thus it is not possible to secure IT
networks to the extent that safety-critical
networks must be secured. Furthermore, there
is a general expectation that
less-consequential IT networks can be more
flexible about network and cybersecurity
program designs than OT networks, but this
flexibility and its benefits vanish if we demand
they be secured to safety-critical standards.

2. The best way to eliminate “abundance of
caution” shutdowns (attack type #6) is to
strengthen OT security programs, and
especially protections at the IT/OT interface to
the point where it becomes practically
impossible for cyber attacks to pivot from IT
networks into OT networks.

3. The best way to eliminate “IT dependency”
shutdowns (attack type #7) is to understand
dependencies and take steps either to
eliminate those dependencies, or to put
network engineering and incident response
measures in place to reduce to acceptable levels all cyber
incident downtime
for reliability-critical IT components.

It should be physically
impossible for cyberattacks
to pivot from IT networks
into high-consequence
OT networks.

The norm today in industrial enterprises is IT
cybersecurity programs are much more mature
than OT cybersecurity programs. It is in this
context that we observe cyber attacks with
physical consequences nearly doubling annually.
Doubling down on this practice of continuing to
emphasize IT protections over OT will not reduce
the slope of the OT incidents curve (in Figure 1).

# Incident Costs

were some noteworthy costs that were disclosed

In another case, global contract manufacturer,
Keytronic, reported an
in May after
disruptions at its Mexico and U.S. sites impacted
business applications supporting operations and
corporate functions. Keytronic was forced to shut
down domestic and Mexican operations for two
weeks during the incident response. To date, the
attack has cost Keytronic over $17 million. The Stoli
Group USA filed for Chapter 11 in US Bankruptcy
Court after a malicious cyber attack forced the
company to operate its global business manually
while the systems are rebuilt. While there were
multiple reasons for the bankruptcy, the cyber
attack was cited as a top reason.

# Supply Chain – CrowdStrike Incident

The July 2024 CrowdStrike failure was not a cyber attack,
but the incident highlighted many industries’ vulnerability
to supply chain attacks. The incident was a defect in a
software update pushed out to customers configured for
automatic updates, causing some 8.5 million devices to
crash and have difficulty rebooting. Thousands of flights
were cancelled, Tesla halted production at a large
factory for four hours, the Port of Houston closed briefly,
and a Swedish mine briefly shut down and evacuated as
a precaution, just to name a few.

When worst-case consequences are
unacceptable, all non-trivial changes and
updates must be tested and evaluated
for security as well as reliability.

The obvious lesson widely drawn from the
incident
the consequences of
malfunction or unavailability of computer
equipment and networks are unacceptable,
owners and operators should test software
and security updates for reliability before
deploying those updates. As
the SolarWinds
2020
incident showed, however, the
same lesson should be applied to malicious
cyber attacks. All changed software or
non-trivial updates must be tested and
evaluated for security as well as reliability, to
prevent malicious updates from impairing
operations.

Cost estimates of the CrowdStrike incident to
IT & OT owners and operators range from $5
billion to $10 billion.

# Global Navigation & IRS Jamming
and Spoofing

The 2024 data set includes three navigation system
jamming and spoofing events, colloquially called
“GPS” events³:

• Finnair cancelled all flights between Helsinki
and Tartu, Estonia for 6 weeks because
widespread GPS spoofing made the route
unsafe, and until a certified alternative
navigational system could be deployed.

• GPS jamming contributed to the crash of
Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243 near Aktau,
Kazahkstan and the death of 38 passengers.
• A nearly 64-hour stretch of GPS jamming over
Poland, Sweden and Germany in March affected
1600 flights with Russia considered the prime
suspect.

GPS jamming affected 1,600
flights over Poland, Sweden,
and Germany in 64 hours.

Despite an international treaty banning GPS
jamming, Russian forces routinely jam and spoof
satellite navigation signals. Furthermore, while
Inertial Reference Systems (IRS) are back-ups for
GPS signal loss in many aircraft, IRS can be
confused by GPS spoofing.

Many IRS use the higher accuracy of GPS
positioning to periodically reset their internal
position estimates to account for drift over time
and other errors in the aircraft’s position.
Thus, when GPS signals are spoofed rather than
jammed, systems
own
understanding of their current location to match
the spoofed (false) GPS
locations, causing
potentially serious safety problems.

# Near Misses

While near misses are not the focus of this report,
we select and report on eleven such attacks that
were significant indicators of threat activity.

For example, Sandworm (or CARR) attacks on
water utilities appear to have come short of
causing significant consequences. In Muleshoe
Texas, however, they did cause water tanks to
overflow for 30 minutes. After these incidents,
credible evidence emerged from Google’s Mandiant
team revealing that CARR was directly supported
by Unit 74455 of Russia's GRU military intelligence
directorate.

In several of their attacks, CARR bragged and
taunted their victims on Telegram and social media
that they could have done much worse. These

types of nation state attacks are often called grey
zone attacks and are becoming more frequent.
Grey zone attacks are often multiple incidents in
sophisticated campaigns that are well resourced
and deliberately planned to test an opponent’s
defenses and response types. These new
nation-state grey-zone campaigns are like the
aircraft sorties that routinely test an opponent’s
control over their air space. In such sorties, military
aircraft routinely and deliberately fly along the
edge of an opponent’s airspace to test response
times, strength, and other defensive capabilities
