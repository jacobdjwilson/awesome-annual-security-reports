## INTRODUCTION
Upon our planet, an intricate and vibrant ecosystem thrives, where
diverse life forms engage in a symbiotic dance that sustains and
enriches all. Birds, animals, plants, insects, and humans coexist in
a delicate balance, each doing its part to support the health and
growth of everyone. Think of the diligent bee pollinating blossoms
and promising fruit. Grazing animals control vegetation, preserving
landscapes for the future. Trees exchange carbon for oxygen in a
silent pact that provides the air we breathe. This is a world of deep
interconnection, where mutual reliance underpins existence itself.

Yet, within this symphony of life, threats lurk. Invasive species upset
the balance by snatching resources and spreading unchecked.
Pollutants seep into pristine environments, threatening the stability
on which life depends. Viruses act like phantom infiltrators, leaving
destruction in their wake. These dangers remind us how fragile and
vulnerable the natural world can be.

Much like this dynamic natural ecosystem, the cyber landscape is a
rich and varied ecosystem. Businesses, governments, and individ-
uals over time have connected a vast array of digital systems and
technologies, which all interact in a web that fuels communication,
trade, and innovation. This interconnected digital ecosystem fosters
growth and opportunity, crossing borders to benefit all.

However, just as invasive species and pollution threaten nature, the
digital world faces its own threats. Malicious actors like hacktivists,
cybercriminals, and state-sponsored spies mimic nature’s invaders.
They launch a range of cyberattacks, from simple to sophisticated,
that continue to evolve and disrupt information flow, exploit
vulnerabilities, and threaten the digital terrain for their own gain.

Enter our _Quarterly Internet Security (ISR) report_ as your guide. We,
as cyber defenders, act like _digital ecologists_, analyzing every byte,
signal, and network to understand the digital threat landscape.
Using our insights, we build strong defenses that mimic nature’s
resilience. By understanding the attacker’s perspective, we can help
preserve the integrity and vitality of our shared digital ecosystem.

As you explore this report, think of it as a map of the _digital jungle_,
highlighting recent threat evolutions and offering ways to keep
this cyber ecosystem safe. More specifically, this report shares
key threat trends seen by many of our products, including mal-
ware developments observed from both network and endpoint
solutions, network attack findings from our intrusion prevention
service (IPS), ransomware development throughout the quarter,
and much more.

In our connected world, general cybersecurity awareness and
proactive defense actions or refinements are our most powerful
tools, which this report hopes to provide. Like ecologists protecting
the Earth, we all have a part to play in safeguarding what sustains
us to ensure a secure future.

### Network-based malware trends
Based on the multiple malware engines available on our Firebox
Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliance, this section of our
report breaks down quarterly malware changes in many ways,
sharing everything from the top malware variants seen by volume
to how much malware evades legacy defenses. In Q1, network-
detected malware exploded, increasing 171% per individual
Firebox, which is the highest quarterly increase we have seen.
Pair this with a significant increase in “zero-day malware,” and this
signals a sharp rise in evasive threats. While we don’t have specific
data to explain the increase, we postulate that underground
malware packing and crypting, and the increase in malicious AI
tools helping malware creation, may explain the growth.

### Network attack trends
The Firebox’s Intrusion Prevention Service (IPS) blocks known
software exploits against many client and server network services.
This section highlights the most common network attacks we
saw during the quarter. We found the volume of network attacks
remained fairly stable, growing a mere single percent. Meanwhile,
the breadth of unique exploits threat attackers tried dropped 16%.

### Top malicious domains
Our DNS firewall service, DNSWatch, shows us the top malicious
phishing, malware, and compromised domains your users almost
visited, if not for our protections. Not much changed between Q4
2024 and Q1 2025, but we still share the top 10 lists and recap the
threats behind some of these domains.

### Endpoint malware trends
We also track the malware trends seen from our endpoint
products, which can differ greatly from network malware
detection trends. While total endpoint malware volume was down
22 percent, we saw a huge 712 percent increase in new unique
malware during Q1. The section also contains details about how
malware arrives on endpoints, as well as ransomware and breach
trends for the quarter

### Digital cybersecurity “ecologist” tips
While the bulk of this report explains what we see the invasive
hacker species doing to disrupt the balance of our shared digital
ecosystem, the purpose of the report is to supply you with the
knowledge to become a cybersecurity ecologist with the latest
research you can use to defend your digital environment. We fill
sections of the report with protection strategies and tips tailored
to withstand the attacks we see, and highlight top defense
strategies at the end.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Like last quarter, network malware close to doubled this quarter, rising 171 percent, while total endpoint malware detection dropped. However,
we also saw a huge (712 percent) rise in new unique malware variants on the endpoints. Combine that with a substantial increase in zero-day
malware detection on the network and this signals a sharp rise in evasive and sophisticated malware, which delivered trojans, information
stealers, coinminers, and phishing threats. While our data doesn’t always provide us with the explanations behind the changes we see, we
theorize that the growth in AI tools on the underground has accelerated threat actors’ ability to develop sophisticated threats quickly at scale.

Meanwhile, network-based attacks and exploits remained stable, only growing by one point. Malicious attackers also targeted a lower number of
specific software flaws, with unique network exploits down 16 percent. Beyond that, we saw little change in our network attack trends, with no
new exploits rising to our top 10 list, and old exploits like ProxyLogon and HAProxy still hanging around, despite their age.

Finally, our endpoint section was rife with interesting changes. While total malware is down, new unique malware variants exploded, as we
shared above. We all saw pretty big changes in some of the regular trends concerning malware delivery vectors. However, ransomware and
cryptominers declined.

To round things out, here are some executive highlights from our Q1 2025 report:

- Total network-based malware detections increased again, rising
171% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). We saw this despite a small
decrease in signature-based and behavioral detection engines,
.as the lion’s share of the growth (323% increase) came from our
proactive AI and machine-learning service IntelligentAV.

- Endpoint total malware volume was down, but we saw a surge in
unique malware detection, increasing about 712% QoQ, which
paired with our network malware trends, shows threat actors are
focusing on new evasive and complex malware.

- Threat actors continue to use encryption to spread malware, with
71% of malware arriving over encrypted (TLS) connections
during Q1, which is an 11-point increase from last quarter, and an
continued increase for the year.

- Almost three-quarters (71%) of malware evaded signature-
based methods. We call this zero-day malware, as it requires
more proactive techniques (IAV/APT) to catch this never-before-
seen malware. The rise was completely due to a rise in malware
detected via our machine-learning and AI methods.

- Adding to this, zero-day malware accounts for 87% of malware
detected over encrypted connections, proving a continued rise
in evasive malware delivery.

- Meanwhile, network attacks increase by a single point during
Q1 2025, with only 93 software exploits per Firebox caught by
IPS signatures – one more than seen last quarter. We also saw
a decline in the number of unique exploits attackers tried, with
unique IPS signature hits down 16%.

- Our “per Firebox” malware results for various network malware
detection services:
    - Average total malware detections per Firebox:
    4,204 (171% increase)
    - Average malware detections by GAV per Firebox:
    374 (31% decrease)
    - Average malware detections by IAV per Firebox:
    3,735 (323% increase)
    - Average malware detections by APT Blocker per Firebox:
    95 (25% decrease)

- We extrapolate that if all the estimated currently active (licensed)
Fireboxes enabled all malware detection security services and
were reporting to us, Fireboxes would have seen 1,624,555,924
malware detections during Q1 2025.

- Ransomware declined 85% from the previous quarter. This
supports the industry trend of a decrease in crypto ransomware.
Attackers are now shifting toward data theft instead of encryption,
as improvements in data backups and recovery have been made.

- Endpoints malware delivery vectors shifted appreciably in Q1.
For years, malicious scripts, primarily PowerShell, have remained
the most common way malware arrives on an endpoint by a fairly
large margin, while Windows binaries have continued to gain
ground as the second-most common vector. However, this quarter
we saw browsers and “other” vectors rising significantly on the list,
suggesting that threat actors are returning to “_drive-by download_”
tactics and delivering malware more often in piracy-related tools
and remote software.

That’s just a glimpse of the trends in invasive cyber species
infiltrating our shared digital ecosystem. For much more detail and
tips that will make you a better cybersecurity ecologist, read on.
