# About the cover

The Verizon 2025 Mobile Security Index (MSI) cover depicts the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and human decision-making now shaping mobile security risks. A human hand reaches toward a mobile phone, while an AI hand waits on the other side, representing bugs, deepfake masks and other symbols of emerging AI-enabled threats.

This visual reflects our central theme that mobile device security is increasingly influenced by AI-driven threats and persistent human error. As organizations expand mobile device use, the dual forces of artificial intelligence and human fallibility can open new attack surfaces and magnify risks. Strengthening defenses against evolving threats targeting mobile devices is essential to safeguarding operations, data and trust across all organizations.

# Who should read this report?

Mobile security is a challenge that cuts across geographies and organization sizes. A breach that begins with a single compromised mobile device can ripple into lost productivity, regulatory fines, reputational damage and costly recovery efforts. As mobile adoption accelerates—and employees continue to rely on personal devices for work—the stakes for managing these risks get higher.

This report is written for the leaders who must anticipate and manage mobile security challenges. Chief information security officers (CISOs), IT and security directors, mobile program managers, and compliance officers will find data and guidance directly applicable to their responsibilities. Business executives, procurement specialists and policymakers will also gain a clearer view of how mobile security can affect resilience, operations and trust.

In this report, you’ll learn how your peers are addressing mobile security, lessons learned from organizations that have implemented effective defenses, and practical insights into the policies and technologies that help deliver stronger outcomes.

# About this report

We produce the MSI each year to provide a clear, data-driven view of how organizations are experiencing mobile security risks and how they are responding. Unlike industry headlines that focus on the latest breach, this report pulls together survey data, partner insights and real-world practices to present a broad picture of mobile security across sectors and regions.

Now in its eighth edition, the MSI is designed to help decision-makers cut through complexity and understand where to focus their limited time and resources. The report highlights where organizations are making progress through smarter training, stronger policies and targeted investments. It also shows where gaps remain.

The MSI offers perspective on which approaches—from mobile device management (MDM) to automation and policy enforcement—correlate with fewer incidents and better resilience.

Findings are based on a 2025 survey of 762 professionals across small, medium and large businesses, as well as Public Sector organizations. Additional insights from leading security providers Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Ivanti Inc. and Lookout Inc. also contributed to the report. The result is a comprehensive source on mobile security trends and practices.

Readers can use this report to benchmark their organizations against peers, identify which measures yield the greatest impact, and inform conversations with executives, boards, regulators and partners. The MSI is not just a snapshot of where mobile security stands today—it is also a guide to where leaders should focus next.

# Introduction: AI-driven
risks are reshaping
mobile security

Every era of technological change has its inflection
point. Electricity, the internet, cloud computing—
each transformed how people live and work, ushering
in new opportunities alongside new vulnerabilities.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has reached that moment,
collapsing decades of adoption cycles into months.

The Verizon 2025 Mobile Security Index (MSI) finds that for organizations, this
acceleration is playing out visibly and urgently on mobile devices. Generative AI
(genAI) has quickly become another app on a mobile device home screen, nestled
among messaging, productivity and social platforms. Its convenience can disguise
risks, introducing vulnerabilities as seamlessly as it enables efficiency.

At the same time, the longstanding challenge of human error remains ever-present.
Despite security policies, awareness training and tools, humans still have the
tendency to click, trust and take shortcuts that generate risks. The key difference
now is that AI appears to sharpen and scale those mistakes, giving attackers
the ability to mirror human communication and exploit human behavior with
unprecedented precision.

Taken together, the survey findings reveal a perfect storm taking shape. Nearly
all employees use mobile devices in organizations of all sizes, and with that usage
comes typical human error. Combined with sophisticated, AI-driven attacks, these
forces are converging to reshape the risks today’s organizations face. Small
missteps, such as clicking a single link, can create waves of operational disruption,
data and financial loss, and reputational damage.

For security leaders, these challenges are not just about weathering the storm. They
are about anticipating the storm’s trajectory and understanding what’s needed to
ensure strong defenses are in place before the next cybersecurity onslaught.

This year’s MSI explores how organizations are experiencing and responding to the
combined impact of AI-driven threats and persistent human error. The findings make
clear that the storm is not on the horizon—it’s here, reshaping mobile threats across
every industry, organization and geographic location. Our survey findings show that
organizations are responding with increased mobile security investments, stronger
employee training programs and adoption of key technologies to help defend against
these growing risks. Our findings also show, however, that there still is limited use of
key defenses and significant gaps exist.

MSI 2025 Introduction

# AI and human error:
A perfect storm

A perfect storm is brewing as AI powered attacks
grow and human mistakes persist.
AI is giving attackers new ways to expand their reach, while human mistakes remain a
common entry point for compromise.

This year’s survey data shows how these forces are converging into a perfect storm:
Organizations report concern over rising AI-powered attacks as well as high levels of
phishing and smishing attempts against employees. Meanwhile, employees continue
to click on suspicious links and enter sensitive data into unapproved genAI tools.

AI’s rising impact on mobile device security
Mobile device attacks are on the rise for a majority of organizations, as cited by 85%
of MSI survey respondents, regardless of their size, industry or location. According
to research from Lookout, more than 4 million mobile-focused social engineering
attacks were detected in 2024.1

In response, three in four organizations have increased mobile device security
spending in the past year. While the causes of successful attacks vary, two
factors are of particular concern for organizations surveyed: the use of genAI
and user behavior.

AI makes attacks more sophisticated.

AI is reshaping mobile threats in ways that draw concern from organizations
surveyed. Of respondents, 34% say they fear that the increasing sophistication and
scale of AI-powered attacks will significantly raise their exposure, and 38% say
ransomware will become even more dangerous when powered by AI. In addition,
77% of respondents believe AI-assisted attacks involving deepfakes—AI-generated
media that mimic real people to deceive or impersonate them—and short message
service (SMS) text phishing are likely to succeed.

Significant
gaps exist.
Amid these issues, defenses
remain limited.

The limited use of defenses
points to uneven progress in
preparing for AI-driven threats.

GenAI adoption outpaces safeguards.
GenAI is a form of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text,
images, code or audio, based on patterns learned from large datasets. Popular
examples include text generators like ChatGPT and image generators like DALL·E,
both of which are often used in workplace settings.

Due to the benefits and time savings they offer, genAI tools are being used more
widely on mobile devices. That growth also brings new risks.

Despite their concerns, only 45% of organizations provide comprehensive training on
the risks associated with mobile AI tools. Half have formal policies in place guiding genAI

Human error remains a constant.
Human error refers to mistakes people make that can weaken security, such as
clicking on phishing or smishing links, entering sensitive data into unsanctioned apps,
or connecting to unsecured Wi-Fi. Despite training and safeguards, these everyday
behaviors continue to play a central role in driving mobile risks.

At 44%, user behavior is the top cited breach contributor, just ahead of app
threats, network threats and internet threats, which were each cited by 43% of
survey respondents. Verizon’s 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report found that
around 60% of confirmed breaches involved a human element.2

Phishing and smishing remain persistent challenges. According to MSI survey data,
80% of organizations reported experiencing mobile phishing attempts targeting their
employees. It’s not surprising, therefore, that many organizations surveyed (80%)
Figure 3. Percentage of employees who clicked on a suspicious link in last smishing test
use smishing simulations to help employees gain greater awareness of cybersecurity
threats. Among those running simulations, 39% reported that between a quarter and
half of their employees clicked a malicious link when tested.

This year’s survey data shows clear implications for organizations: As AI creates
new ways for attackers to exploit human behavior and compromise mobile devices,
the resulting risks can quickly spread across networks of every size. To respond,
proven mobile security approaches are needed to help contain and address these
emerging threats.

# Partner insight
Defending against
human-centric
threats–Lookout Inc.

Human-centric threats drive a new
mobile security imperative.
The cyberthreat landscape has fundamentally changed, with
attackers now targeting the enterprise’s most vulnerable element:
humans. As employees work and access cloud data fluidly across
personal and corporate mobile devices, attackers are shifting to
human-centric threats that exploit behaviors, decisions and social
interactions. Their ultimate goal is to obtain login credentials to gain
unauthorized access to company resources and sensitive data.

Mobile devices have become the most direct path between attackers
and their victims. Always on and deeply personal, these devices
offer cybercriminals a rich opportunity to leverage sophisticated
social engineering techniques that traditional security tools cannot
detect. With AI enhancing the effectiveness of smishing, executive
impersonation and multifactor authentication (MFA) token theft,
individuals are now even more susceptible to these social
engineering techniques.

Today’s attacks unfold far beyond email. Threat actors are leveraging
SMS, voice and messaging apps to engage in seemingly authentic
communications that exploit trust and familiarity. The result is that
time to respond has diminished greatly, leaving organizations just
minutes to catch and contain the threat before it wreaks havoc on
their infrastructure.

To protect against this growing threat, organizations need mobile
security strategies that are cloud-native by design, ensuring they can
scale to provide real-time visibility into mobile activity.

This approach enables the rapid detection of human-centric threats
and the ability to take swift, informed action before an incident
spreads. Modern mobile security must do more than protect devices;
it must protect people from deception and exploitation and close
critical blind spots that happen most naturally at the mobile edge.

To protect against
this growing threat,
organizations need
mobile security
strategies that are
cloud-native by design,
ensuring they can
scale to provide real-
time visibility into
mobile activity.

# The disruptive impacts
of mobile security
compromise

The consequences of a mobile security incident
can be significant and often lead to downtime.
The reported consequences of mobile breaches can be significant. Organizations
reported negative outcomes from a breach, including downtime, data loss, financial
penalties, reputational damage and regulatory issues. These reported repercussions
underscore some potential impacts that can occur when a mobile device is
compromised.

Overconfidence leaves organizations unprepared.
Confidence levels among organizations in detecting and recovering from mobile security
breaches remain strikingly high. Of those surveyed, 91% are confident employee misuse
of mobile devices would be spotted quickly, with 47% very confident. And 96% say they
are somewhat confident or very confident they could recover quickly from a mobile
attack; 52% say they are very confident in that belief.

Figure 4. Confidence in quick recovery

The high cost of compromise

The MSI indicates that when incidents do occur, they rarely have a single effect.
Among surveyed organizations that experienced a mobile-related security incident,
47% reported downtime, 45% reported data loss, and 40% reported financial
penalties or fines.

Another 28% reported reputational damage, while 22% reported that they faced
regulatory action—all potentially costly impacts that can quickly spread across the
organization.

Downtime disrupts operations.

Compared to the previous year, downtime stands out as one of the most disruptive
consequences of a mobile security breach cited by respondents. And the impact
appears to be intensifying.

Insurance penalties and other real-world
outcomes

The consequences of compromise are not limited to technical disruption. Of
organizations surveyed, 36% experienced cyber insurance penalties such as higher
premiums, reduced coverage or denied claims. In fact, this insurance impact was
cited by respondents more often than any other real-world consequence.

Additionally, 60% of organizations report that they carry cyber insurance,
suggesting that while many organizations seek to transfer some risk, possible gaps
in policy coverage leave open the potential for costly remediation.

The broader ripple effect

Taken together, the survey results show that mobile security incidents can lead to
downtime, data loss, financial penalties, reputational damage and regulatory issues.
These outcomes highlight the downstream consequences of compromise that can
extend well beyond the device and potentially have more severe effects on daily
operations and business continuity.

# Rising investments,
stronger defenses

75%

of organizations have
increased mobile security
spending in the past year.

76%

believe their mobile security
budgets should increase
again in the coming year.

To defend themselves, most organizations are
ramping up spending on mobile security, employee
training and smarter tools.
Given rising threats to mobile devices, organizations are shoring up security with
tangible investments. Budgets for mobile security are expanding; mobile security
training programs are reaching more employees; and many are shifting to company-
owned devices to improve control.

The goals for these investments go beyond preventing incidents to include risk

Mobile security investment is on the rise.
Survey results reflect a growing recognition that mobile security is increasingly on the
radar of organizational leadership, influenced by a growing understanding of today’s
mobile security risks, compliance requirements, and by the practical realities of a
mobile and distributed workforce.

For example, most organizations have formal security budgets in place, with 80% of
organizations we surveyed reporting a defined overall security budget. Of those with
a defined security budget, a robust 89% have a specific amount earmarked for mobile
security. What’s more, 75% of organizations surveyed increased mobile security
spending in the past year. And 76% of organizations polled believe their mobile
security budgets will increase again in the coming year.

When asked what’s driving these investments, respondents cited greater threat
awareness (48%), more users (43%), increasing threats (42%), more devices (41%),
compliance (41%), more apps (41%), and a remote or hybrid workforce (39%).

Figure 8. Drivers behind increased mobile security spending

When asked what’s

The biggest influence, however,
may be the cost of doing business
today. Of organizations surveyed,
84% reported that a client, partner,
regulator or insurance provider
demanded they demonstrate the
maturity of their mobile device security
strategy. That need, along with the
growing list of threats facing security
teams, may be enough to make the
case to the C-suite, board members and
shareholders that organizations can’t
afford to ignore potential cyber risks.

Employee training is expanding,
but there’s still room for improvement.
The majority of organizations are also making investments in employee mobile
security awareness through phishing and smishing training and simulation testing.

For example, 62% of organizations surveyed provide mobile security training when
onboarding new employees and 58% do so when issuing new devices. However,
there’s still room for improvement among organizations that don’t provide this training.

A more encouraging development—especially in the face of more sophisticated, AI-
powered mobile device hacking attempts—is that more organizations are taking AI
risk training seriously.

Concession devices are favored
by a majority.
Company-provided mobile devices, also known as concession devices, are one way
organizations can help reduce risks that are often associated with bring your own

Best practices adoption shows results.
The survey included eight mobile security best practices and asked respondents
to indicate which ones they have implemented.

Even though only 4% of organizations surveyed reported that they have
implemented all eight best practices, the results of doing so are impressive. Those
that did were half as likely to report experiencing downtime from a mobile-related
incident and five times less likely to report major repercussions.

organization did not implement all eight security best practices. What’s more, of the
organizations that implemented all eight best practices, just 12% reported major
repercussions, compared with the overall survey average of 63%.

Analyzing this group shows that comprehensive adoption of security best practices
can pay dividends, but it also highlights how much progress remains for the majority
of organizations.

Eight trusted mobile
cybersecurity best
practices

• Mobile device
management
(MDM) and unified endpoint
management (UEM): Using
a single platform to centrally
manage, secure and update all
user devices, including laptops,
phones and tablets

• Mobile threat defense (MTD):
Detecting and blocking mobile-
specific risks such as phishing,
malicious apps and device
compromise in real time

• Zero trust: Verifying every user

and device before granting access
to the network—regardless of
location—to reduce insider and
credential-based threats

• Secure access service edge

(SASE): Combining network and
security services such as firewalls
and secure web gateways to
protect remote and hybrid workers
through the cloud

• Secure enterprise browser and
secure web gateway: Enforcing
security controls within the
browser to protect access to cloud
and web apps; ideal for zero trust
and remote work environments

• Endpoint detection and response

(EDR): Monitoring mobile and
endpoint activity to detect,
investigate and automatically
respond to threats across devices

• Managed detection and response

(MDR): 24/7 expert threat
detection and incident response
as a managed service, often
powered by EDR tools and threat
intelligence

• Cyber risk quantification

(CRQ): Translating cyberthreats
into financial impact to guide
investments, board conversations
and cyber insurance decisions

passkey access. In addition, 52% of respondents said they use advanced MFA.

Separately, another 62% report using AI-powered software to automatically revoke
mobile access privileges based on risk signals.

Enhanced security and operational efficiency
are top objectives.
The survey indicated clear objectives driving organizational investment and
technology decisions. While enhancing mobile security tops the list of objectives,
operational efficiency objectives are not far behind.

The organizations surveyed said they are investing to:

• Enhance security for current user activities (51%)

• Reduce the risk of breaches or incidents (49%)

• Reduce IT workload (42%)

• Improve user experience and productivity (42%)

• Enable secure access to new services for remote workers (41%)

• Unify security management across mobile devices (34%)

Taken together, these objectives and the increased spend noted by most
organizations surveyed show progress in terms of bigger budgets, broader
employee training and smarter tools. This indicates there’s more buy-in on the
benefits of expanded mobile security from organizational leadership.

Yet remaining gaps leave openings that adversaries may exploit. Achieving mobile
security resilience will depend on not just spending more but also on applying
investments effectively across both the workforce and the organization’s mobile
device infrastructure. This is true especially in the face of AI-powered threats and
ongoing human error.

zero-click exploits and new
AI-enhanced threats to access
sensitive information, impact
businesses and introduce risk to
critical infrastructure. Applications
used for email, collaboration and
file-sharing have also become
vectors for account takeover
and business email compromise,
data loss, harmful malware, and
expensive ransomware events.

The solution
To increase the efficacy
of security programs in
response to these new mobile
threats, organizations should
take a proactive stance by
implementing a comprehensive

security architecture that
goes beyond just zero-trust
network access (ZTNA). AI-
based threat prevention that
includes protection for mobile
devices and for critical business
communication applications
such as email, collaboration
and file-sharing applications
is paramount. Achieving
successful security outcomes
requires a comprehensive
approach with a collaborative
framework for intelligence
sharing and tight integration
between security tools.

Beyond ZTNA:
Hybrid mesh security
architecture
The hybrid mesh security
architecture is a modern, diverse
and decentralized security
and networking architecture
where cloud-based security
controls and policy enforcement
are embedded directly into
distributed network nodes
across network edge, IoT/
operational technology (OT),
mobile devices, branches, clouds,
data centers and applications.
When deployed, it enables
fast, scalable, automated and
adaptive protection by pushing
intelligence and enforcement to
the interconnected nodes.

Secure, efficient and effective
business communication
needs to be multifaceted
and include threat prevention
for mobile devices as well
as interconnected business
applications. Organizations that
seek strong security outcomes
should adopt a prevention-first
hybrid mesh security architecture
as part of their enterprise
security strategy to better
safeguard their digital resources.

# Managing devices,
managing risk

Organizations using MDM tend to have stronger
security policies, especially for AI.
MDM is helping organizations build stronger, more consistent defenses.
Organizations using MDM report more comprehensive training, clearer policies and
stronger enforcement—especially for AI-related risks.

In contrast, organizations that have considered but rejected MDM faced higher
rates of lost data. Of organizations that rejected MDM, 63% experienced lost data,
compared with 50% overall. Among this group, 31% also described their risk as
extreme, more than double the 15% study average.

Personal devices are shown to increase
attack exposure.
Based on survey responses, the added risks of using personal devices for work
are noteworthy: 70% of mobile devices impacted by an attack are personal, not
corporate-issued.

Figure 14. Personal devices drive higher risk.

The diversity and volume of device types
also continue to expand organizational
attack surfaces. For example, 51% of
organizations surveyed expect the
number of IoT devices they manage to
increase in 2025. This could potentially
impact operational technology (OT)
environments that heavily leverage
IoT in critical infrastructure industries
such as energy, manufacturing and
transportation.

When organizations allow only company-
owned devices and already use MDM,
the rate of defined and enforced genAI
usage policies rises to 66%.

What is MDM?

Mobile device
management (MDM)
enables businesses—
from a small business
with no IT staff to a large
enterprise—to manage
a wide range of devices
that access company
apps and resources.

MDM solutions help
manage devices,
employee access,
privileges and policies.
These solutions also
help businesses control
vulnerabilities in their
software and hardware.
