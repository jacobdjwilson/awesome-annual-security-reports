### Executive summary
![Executive Summary]

As the AI hype settles, the conversation has shifted
to value. Leaders are no longer asking if they should
use AI, but how they can scale proven use cases
and build sophisticated AI agents for business value.
Our latest research confirms this fundamental change
in business mindset.

We have seen AI evolve from predictive to generative.
Now, we’re in the agentic era, where AI agents can
independently execute tasks and make decisions—
under human guidance and guardrails. At Google,
we think of AI agents as systems that combine the
intelligence of advanced AI models with access to tools,
so they can take actions on your behalf and under your
control. And while this technology is already helping
people get more done, many companies are still in the
early phases of agentic maturity.

Companies that were quick to adopt AI agents are
seeing real returns. They’re using agents to improve
customer experiences, free up employees for
smarter work, and give departments like marketing,
IT, and HR a productivity boost. This ROI helps justify
bigger investments and get leadership on board for
a broader AI scaling strategy.

For leaders charting their AI strategy, this report
blueprints the strategies of successful early adopters
to help you turn agentic AI into tangible business results.

### The agentic shift
![The agentic shift]

### AI agents have
rapidly emerged
as the next
competitive frontier

Businesses are now implementing a wide range of technologies,
from simple chatbots to complex, multi-agent systems that can
independently manage complex workflows.

This marks a fundamental shift from AI that simply assists to
AI that can operate independently under human control and
guidance. Organizations that are adopting this technology
early—backed by executive commitment and increasing
funding—are establishing a significant competitive advantage
and providing a blueprint for success.

[^8]: Total (global): n=3466; Question text: (1) How are AI agents leveraged across the enterprise? (2) How many AI agents does your company currently have deployed in production across your organization?

52%

of executives state their
organizations using gen AI
now also leverage AI agents[^8]

Definition of AI agents used in the survey

AI agents are specialized LLMs that have specific roles,
context, and objectives to independently plan, reason, and
perform tasks with access to data function call APIs and
can interact with other AI agents if needed. These can be
pre-built or in-house built agents.

### AI agents are applicable across a wide variety
of use cases, and I believe every business
has workflows where agentic AI can deliver
meaningful value. It accelerates existing
processes, driving measurable business impact.”

Fiona Tan
CTO, Wayfair

### AI agents
have arrived
![AI agents have arrived]

Though its core technologies were largely
theoretical just a year or two ago, agentic
AI is already in widespread deployment—
deeply integrated across industries and
around the world.

39%

of executives say their organization has
launched more than 10 AI agents[^9]

[^9]: Total (global): n=3466; Question text: How many AI agents does your company currently have deployed in production across your organization?

For humans, time is
invaluable. AI can amplify
people’s work to save that
time. We’re entering an era
where humans and machines
will have a truly symbiotic
relationship.”

Velit Dundar
VP of Global eCommerce, Radisson Hotel Group

### The global
footprint of
AI agents
![The global footprint of AI agents]

The adoption of AI agents is accelerating
at a remarkable pace—now rapidly
appearing in organizations of every size,
sector, and location.

The consistent emergence of AI agents across diverse organizational
types points to a powerful, developing trend toward widespread use.

However, the application of AI agents varies by region, as different
business imperatives inform the most valuable tasks for agents to
take over. Regional priorities shape where these agents show up
first—in Europe, for example, AI-enhanced tech support is a key
priority. Meanwhile, JAPAC respondents indicated customer service
as their organization’s top agentic AI use case and LATAM ranked
marketing as the key area of potential.[^10]

humans behind the scenes,
and all of that support
ultimately translates
into improving financial
performance.”

Cross-industry AI agent use cases

From customer service and marketing to security
operations and tech support, AI agents are helping
people get more done—handling the tedious tasks
so they can focus on the work that matters to them.

across industries
![AI agent adoption varies across industries]

While AI agents are being deployed broadly,
every industry has its own priorities—as
companies put investment into the use cases
that deliver the most significant impact.
It’s clear that agentic AI isn’t a niche trend confined to the technology
sector or large corporations. This deployment represents a fundamental
operational shift occurring across the business landscape.

There are opportunities
everywhere for AI agents
across the media and
entertainment industry.
Currently, we’re focused on
improving media production
flow, from idea to distribution.”

### The early adopter
advantage
![The early adopter advantage]

Within the broader landscape of AI agent
adoption, a distinct cohort of early adopters
is setting themselves apart.

These early adopters dedicate at least 50% of their future AI
budget to AI agents and already have agents deeply embedded
across operations.

The top performance of early adopters isn’t chance—it’s the result
of a deliberate strategy centered on deep technical capability and
organizational commitment.

significant value from gen AI across key areas—
including customer experience, business growth,
security, and marketing[^19]

Executives from agentic AI early adopter
organizations are also more likely to report ROI
on all cross-industry agentic AI use cases[^20]

### You have to look at ROI as not just size of return
but also speed of return. AI initiatives are sizable
investments that are not commodities yet, so we
have to look at where hyper-automation and scaling
with AI is actually generating a return first. How fast
is your investment coming back to the organization
and what capabilities are you investing in now that
will scale up and create more efficiencies
or business transformation down the road?”

### We’re seeing a virtuous cycle in AI
implementation—demonstrable ROI is
accelerating the adoption of gen AI
for certain use cases, which in turn justifies
an even greater focus on those use cases.
After 2024 proved that gen AI really works, 2025 is all about
building on that success. Early adopters and leaders are
compounding their advantage by layering new AI applications
on top of their initial wins.

Five key benefits emerged from the global
data set as having the greatest overall gains
attributed to gen AI.
While executives’ estimates of gen AI value-add are generally
more conservative than in 2024, a higher share report improved
customer experience.[^24]

These areas provide a template for executives and senior leaders
to re-imagine their organization’s business functions once
augmented with gen AI. Even a well-tested use case, like using
gen AI for chat in customer service, can free up valuable human
resources for more challenging tasks.
