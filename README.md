# Awesome Annual Security Reports [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)
> A curated list of annual cyber security reports - Centralized annual cybersecurity analysis and industry surveys

**Definition:** The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, making it hard for CIOs, CISOs, and security leaders to keep up. They're flooded with annual reports from research consultancies, industry working groups, non-profits, and government agencies, and sifting through marketing material to find actionable insights is a major challenge. This list aims to cut through the noise by providing a vendor-neutral resource for the latest security trends, tools, and partnerships. It curates information from trusted sources, making it easier for security leaders to make informed decisions.

**Disclaimer:** The reports in this collection are limited to content which does not require a paid subscription, membership, or service contract. There are a variety of different business models and drivers that would cause information to be put behind a paywall, I would like to respect those companies and individuals. Consult the original authors for licensing of any report content.

**Limitations:** This is **not** a collection of project based information such as white papers, intelligence reports, technical specifications, or standards. I welcome all user submitted uploads or report requests, but we should draw a box around this _awesome_ list. All reports will be sourced from the original author when possible and uploaded to [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/) for an additional level of confidence, result link will be included in the readme.md commit notes.

**Acknowledgement:** I would like to give recognition for other works that inspired this collection. [Richard Stiennon](https://it-harvest.com/about/) and his annual analysis of the cybersecurity industry is significantly more comprehensive than this repository and deserves recognition. Additionally, [Rick Howard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickhoward/)'s cyber cannon list of must-read books is an invaluable resource, catering to both leadership and practitioner levels within the field.

## Reports

Reports have been classified into two categories by the source of data:
- **Analysis:** Reports generated from quantifying and qualifying intelligence from sensor networks or services.
- **Survey:** Reports generated from observations and feedback from surveys or consulting engagements.

The reports listed below are the most recent iteration, while past versions are stored in their corresponding yearly folders. After three years, if a source has not updated a report it will no longer be featured in the ReadMe.md file but will still be accessible within the repository directory corresponding to its respective year.

Reports will be classified by a header that describes their primary content or emphasis. While each report may discuss multiple topics, this categorization will help organize them. Under this header they will be sorted alphabetically.
