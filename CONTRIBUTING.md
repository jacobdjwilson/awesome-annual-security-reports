# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Awesome Annual Security Reports repository! We welcome all contributions.

## The Easy Way: Suggest a Report

If you're not familiar with Git or pull requests, the easiest way to contribute is by suggesting a report.

[**➡️ Click here to suggest a new report**](https://github.com/jacobdjwilson/awesome-annual-security-reports/issues/new/choose)

Simply fill out the form with a link to the report, and a maintainer will review it and add it to the collection.

## The Advanced Way: Create a Pull Request

If you are comfortable with Git, you can add a report directly by following these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Add the PDF:** Place the new report's PDF file into the correct `Annual Security Reports/<year>/` directory. Please use the naming convention: `Organization-ReportTitle-Year.pdf`.
3.  **Commit your changes.** The commit will trigger the automated pipeline to process the file, analyze it, and update the `README.md`.
4.  **Create a pull request** against the `main` branch.

Our GitHub Actions pipeline will handle the conversion, analysis, and README update automatically. A maintainer will review and merge the final pull request.

We appreciate your contributions and thank you for your suggestions!
